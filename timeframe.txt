across an unwritten calendar
across centuries of longing
across millennia
across parallel timelines
across the bones of an ancient timeline
across the boundary between real and myth
across the entirety of a human life
across the hush of a borrowed century
across the hush of a possibility just born
across the hush of a silent revolution
across the hush of cosmic possibility
across the hush of dawn’s second breath
across the hush of horizon’s edge
across the hush of long-forgotten lullabies
across the hush of memory’s corridors
across the hush of time’s final ripple
across the hush of unspoken promises
across the lull of a wounded season
across the moment an artist’s brush first meets canvas
across the promise of changing winds
across the quiet longing of centuries
across the tapestry of hidden hours
across the tapestry of lost legends
after a silent walk home on a rainy day
after a single note lingers in total quiet
after a stargazer locates a hidden constellation
after the cast takes their final bow on stage
after the city’s only payphone is removed
after the collapse of civilization
after the dawn of artificial intelligence
after the discovery of a new element
after the discovery of faster-than-light travel
after the discovery of the unified theory of everything
after the end of storytelling
after the factory whistle signals the end of an era
after the final bus departs a vacant station
after the final chord in an abandoned music hall
after the final goodbye
after the final page is typed on a worn typewriter
after the final petal drops from the old rosebush
after the heat death of the universe
after the invention of the wheel
after the invention of time travel
after the last balloon deflates in an empty hall
after the last battle is fought
after the last breath of a dying god
after the last call at the diner on the corner
after the last code is broken
after the last drop of oil is extracted
after the last echo of laughter fades
after the last empire crumbles
after the last glacier melts
after the last human dream is dreamt
after the last human emotion is felt
after the last human is born
after the last human law is broken
after the last human memory fades
after the last human memory is digitized
after the last human sets foot on earth
after the last human story is written
after the last library card gets returned to the desk
after the last mountain erodes
after the last photo is snapped in a deserted hallway
after the last resource war
after the last riddle is solved
after the last riddle is whispered at a puzzle event
after the last roadside vendor packs up at dusk

as an anchor lifts for a ship’s maiden voyage
as dust gathers on an untouched piano
as the audience trickles in to a dusty theater
as the carnival packs up under the first rays of dawn
as the old rocking chair finally slows to a stop
at the bell’s echo marking a forgotten recess
at the boundary of farmland soon to be sold
at the break of a brittle branch in a silent forest
at the brink of change
at the close of a suitcase that may never reopen
at the close of an unspoken dream
at the crossing of a year everyone would rather forget
at the crossing of two unwritten paths
at the crossing where two timelines should never meet
at the crossroads of tradition and progress
at the crossroads where two destinies exchange places
at the cusp of seasons
at the edge of twilight
at the end of a corridor no one dares walk
at the end of a line nobody wants to cross
at the exact second a promise is sworn
at the final moment of an abandoned summer
at the final step down a worn flight of stairs
at the first ring of a call that changes fate
at the fleeting second a reflection vanishes in water
at the hour a butterfly emerges from its chrysalis
at the hush after a cashier closes out the register
at the hush as a candle’s flame is pinched
at the hush as an empty playground swing drifts in the breeze
at the hush as an empty swing set slows to a stop
at the hush before the judge reads the verdict
at the hush in a barbershop after the last trim of the day
at the hush just before a condemned building is demolished
at the hush of a deserted intersection late at night
at the hush of a phone once its battery dies
at the hush of an empty mailbox at midday
at the hush of unexpected applause
at the hush once a baby’s lullaby ends
at the hush when a long-lost puzzle piece reappears
at the hush when a truce forms without words
at the instant a dancer’s foot first touches the stage
at the instant a frozen computer finally restarts
at the instant a new recipe is finally tasted
at the intersection where an old tradition ends
at the last soft whisper of winter’s bite
at the moment a pin is heard in a silent corridor
at the moment a sculptor’s chisel first strikes marble
at the moment a teacher wipes the final formula away
at the moment an elevator arrives to an empty floor
at the moment coffee cools in an abandoned mug
at the moment dried leaves first touch ground
at the pause between raindrops
at the quiet breakroom after someone resigns
at the quiet intersection of heartbreak and healing
at the quiet lull in a standoff no one anticipated
at the second a handshake seals a hidden deal
at the spot where a map tears, dividing known from unknown
at the threshold of a child’s very first school day
at the threshold of an apology yet to be spoken
at the threshold of discovery
at the very end of a distant radio broadcast
before a lonely candle flame gutters out
before recorded history
before the birth of a new star
before the doctor’s chart confirms a turning point
before the first being learns to record its experiences
before the first creature crawls onto land
before the first creature develops sentience
before the first dance begins
before the first dream takes flight
before the first lie is told
before the first myth is born
before the first prayer is whispered by a mortal
before the first question is asked
before the first story is told
before the first tear is shed
before the orchestra’s opening note in the final movement
before the universe begins

during the hush that follows the final siren
during the hush when a roller coaster stalls at its peak
during the hush where past meets prophecy
during the late shift at an all-night diner
during the lull before an apologetic text is sent
during the lull in a protest when voices gather again
during the lull on a store’s very first opening day
during the midday lull when time feels suspended
during the migration of clouds
during the migration of the last monarch butterfly
during the moment an old photograph starts to fade
during the moment the last puzzle piece slips away
during the painter’s confession
during the prophecy’s window
during the quiet shift before sunrise in a hospital ward
during the ritual of morning coffee
during the second wave of shifting fortune
during the slow dance of celestial bodies
during the slow fade of an echoing hour
during the transition from analog to digital
during the turn of a key that locks away the past
during virtual calls
during writing
in the breath after a child’s question is left unanswered
in the brittle hush of a broken clock
in the cradle of a whispered minute
in the ephemeral pause of a breath
in the final minute before a library shuts its doors
in the final second before an ice sculpture collapses
in the final second of a countdown that never finishes
in the final stillness before fireworks ignite
in the heartbeat after a dream returns
in the hush after a coin toss decides fate
in the hush after a grandfather clock abruptly stops
in the hush after a surprise party empties
in the hush after an unexpected award is refused
in the hush after the final guest leaves a wedding
in the hush as a snowflake melts on warm skin
in the hush as the last parade float disappears
in the hush before someone finally says, “I love you”
in the hush before someone opens a private journal
in the hush left behind by a heated argument
in the hush of a barn loft just after sunrise
in the hush of a childhood bedroom left forever
in the hush of a discount store at closing time
in the hush of a half-lit corridor
in the hush of a hidden sunrise
in the hush of a line that never moves
in the hush of a memory reclaimed
in the hush of a parole hearing’s final word
in the hush of a simmering future
in the hush of a stadium before the first pitch
in the hush of improbable beginnings
in the hush of midnight
in the hush of the unremembered future
in the hush right before a new invention is revealed
in the hush where hope takes root
in the instant a firework fizzles and leaves smoke
in the last flicker of a guttering lantern
in the lull between echoing thunder and fresh rain
in the moment a homemade raft touches open water
in the moment a secret is whispered between friends
in the moment when a puzzle piece finally fits
in the pause between a singer’s verses
in the quiet that follows a train whistle’s echo
in the second a new silhouette appears on the horizon
in the second a simple yes or no can change everything
in the second before a life-changing kiss
in the seconds following a sudden revelation
in the short pause following a newborn’s first cry
in the space between the first tear and the final sigh
in the space between thunder and lightning
in the space where an apology waits unspoken
in the standstill of a broken escalator
in the stolen moment between curfew and sunrise
in the waiting breath of a fresh idea
in the waiting room once good news arrives
just after the final name is crossed off a list
just before the clock tower chimes midnight
through centuries of layered dust
through eons of silent wonder
through generations of silent watchers
through the hush of an overlooked era
through the hush of ancient prophecies
through the hush of distant galaxies
through the hush of fate unraveling
through the hush of time’s unraveling tapestry
through the lingering shadows of dusk
through the night air on the eve of a bold discovery
through the restless hush of midwinter
through the silent overture of tomorrow

under a fleeting golden sunset
under a waxing moon’s glow
under the soft hush of a distant morning
upon the hour that divides bad habits and new starts
when a forgotten promise resurfaces without warning
when a last vow is written in a hidden diary
when a new language sparks in a child’s mind
when a regretful letter remains unsent
when an old watchtower clock strikes an unexpected hour
when an outdated phone’s dial tone cuts out
when ancient echoes converge on today
when chalk lines on the sidewalk fade away
when color bleeds from day into night
when memory flickers into legend
when only one star remains in a dimming sky
when shadows learn to speak
when the attic trunk is locked on family history
when the band stops playing at the corner bar
when the bus driver completes the final route
when the clock dares to skip a beat
when the day’s earliest train departs at dawn
when the final calendar page of the year is flipped
when the final leaf drops from the ancient oak
when the final piece of evidence is filed away
when the last star fades into morning light
when the library’s last light flickers out
when the morning paper lands on an empty porch
when the night yields to golden embers
when the old sewing machine stops mid-stitch
when the old typewriter’s keys finally go silent
when the orchard dog finally stops barking at night
when the orchard sign has faded beyond recognition
when the orchard’s keeper finishes the day’s final chore
when the orchard’s last apple finally falls
when the overhead fluorescent buzz dies off
when time folds in on itself
while elevator doors close on an unresolved farewell
while illusions fade to memory
while shifting sands erase footprints
while the battered barn door drifts on its hinges
while the city’s lights flicker after an unexpected outage
while the cosmic ballet unfolds
while the final seeds are planted in a forgotten field
while the hourglass resets its sand
while the old gods slumber
while the old projector flickers in an abandoned movie house
while the orchard cat dozes beneath a dying tree
while the orchard fence surrenders to rust
while the sands of time flow backward
while the universe hums its secret song
within a mirrored reflection
within the architecture of the mind
within the concept of infinity
within the cyclical nature of existence
within the ephemeral nature of time
within the flow of a river
within the folds of spacetime
within the infinite possibilities of a multiverse
within the realm of the subconscious
within the space of a thought experiment
within the span of a shared smile
within the tapestry of fate
