# Combined-panel comparison data

[Ratings and 95% bootstrap intervals](ratings.csv) · [Direct margins](pair_stats.csv) · [Unique story pairs](pair_story.csv) · [Evaluator agreement](evaluator_agreement.csv) · [Panel bridges](panel_bridges.csv) · [Story lengths](word_count_summary.csv)

This is a pooled observed-panel fit, using the same Thurstone estimator, side-bias correction and 300 story/evaluator bootstrap draws (seed 12345) as the pre-migration publication. Every accepted historical and current-panel judgment remains in the source ledger. Compatible source scopes are collapsed before fitting: one vote per distinct evaluator/story and one fit row per matched story pair. Grader versions are distinct; repeated source scopes do not confer extra votes.

Bootstrap intervals describe the pooled observed comparison set; they do not provide worst-case bounds for unavailable judgments or incomplete generations. The shaded chart strips restore the earlier density rendering derived from bootstrap interval widths.

[Previous calibrated-v4 analysis](../writing_v4_opus50/README.md) remains a separate snapshot with a different target and uncertainty method. Its wide bounded intervals are not reused as pooled bootstrap intervals.

The tables cover 56 writers, 908 direct model pairings, 15,172 distinct story pairs, and 102,592 judgments. All rated writers retain their overall ranks.
