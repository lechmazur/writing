<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in grief is clear and effectively tied to the sea glass object. However, the character's leap to believing consciousness can be encoded in gravitational waves based on microfilm feels underdeveloped and slightly undermines the grounded portrayal of loss. The 'lone trapper' aspect fits the isolation well.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc (grief -> secret investigation -> hopeful discovery) is discernible within the word limit. However, the 'decoding microfilm from shady archives' method feels incongruous, introducing a slightly pulpy element that clashes with the introspective tone. The final DNA sequence reveal is abrupt and overly convenient, weakening coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The floating observatory setting is effectively rendered and enhances the themes of isolation and cosmic perspective. The sea glass object connects meaningfully to both the character's past (Earth) and present (observatory view). The 'silently audible' detail is intriguing, though the intended 'gritty whimsy' tone feels unbalanced; the grit dominates, while whimsy is marginal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story successfully evokes melancholy and tentative hope, utilizing symbolism (sea glass, black hole) effectively. The central conflict is clear. However, the reliance on stating the 'upside of loss' rather than purely showing it, and the somewhat easily achieved final revelation, lessen the overall impact and subtextual depth expected at the highest tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While avoiding overtly machine-like prose, the story leans on familiar tropes (grieving scientist, mysterious space signals). The central sci-fi conceit (DNA/consciousness in black hole radiation) feels somewhat generic and strains credulity without sufficient grounding, bordering on convenient wish fulfillment rather than truly original speculation. The microfilm element also feels formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion, integrating most elements reasonably well, particularly the character's grief, the setting, and the sea glass. However, the microfilm plot device and the overly neat resolution feel somewhat forced, suggesting the elements dictated the plot rather than emerging organically from a deeper narrative necessity. The potential is evident, but execution lacks the subtlety and inevitability of top-tier work.</comment>
