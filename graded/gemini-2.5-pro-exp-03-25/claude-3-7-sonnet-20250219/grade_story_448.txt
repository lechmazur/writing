<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character traits like "rebelliously docile" and "distrustful" are stated more than demonstrated through nuanced action or internal monologue. Motivation is clear but lacks deep exploration within the scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc with functional tension (sewing machine), but the core conflict resolution (altering a registry) feels somewhat conventional. Pacing is adequate but unremarkable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is established with appropriate sensory details (soot, grime), but these lean towards the expected rather than offering striking originality. The candlestick feels more utilitarian than deeply resonant with the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Relies heavily on telling ("His distrustful nature...") rather than showing. Symbolism is present but lacks subtlety. The ending promises future developments but offers limited immediate emotional or thematic impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The core concept (mage-sweeps, tactile casting) is original, but execution employs some clich√©d phrasing ("eyes narrowing," "heart pounding") and lacks a truly distinctive voice. Feels competent but somewhat formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements are incorporated adequately, but the integration isn't seamless (candlestick feels less essential than the seashell). The story fulfills its constraints but doesn't feel artistically inevitable or exceptionally memorable.</comment>
