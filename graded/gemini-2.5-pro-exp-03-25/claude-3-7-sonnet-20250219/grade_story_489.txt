<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Eliza's 'aggressively kind' attribute is stated but weakly demonstrated, and her instantaneous shift lacks psychological depth. The narrator's motivation remains vague until the very end, and their 'voice' is somewhat generic for a centuries-old entity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc, but the resolution feels abrupt. Eliza's sudden understanding and the narrator's merging occur too rapidly, sacrificing coherence and pacing for a swift conclusion within the word limit. The dancer connection feels tacked on.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting creates adequate atmosphere, but the 'haunted' aspect feels underdeveloped. The contrast between the ancient setting/mystery and the 'basic plastic whistle' isn't explored effectively. Sensory details are present but not exceptional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story attempts subtext (transcendence vs. tragedy) and uses symbolism (whistle, lighthouse), but the execution lacks subtlety. The ending provides resolution but feels somewhat unearned due to rushed character shifts. Showing is often replaced by telling, particularly regarding Eliza's understanding and the narrator's purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Relies heavily on tropes (haunted lighthouse, disappearing keepers, ancient secrets) without significant subversion. Eliza's sudden acceptance and the narrator's convenient intervention feel formulaic. Phrases like "formless essence finally finding purpose" border on clich√©. The merging resolution lacks originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story struggles to cohesively integrate all elements within the brief format; some feel forced (dancer timing, 'aggressively kind'). While attempting a unique twist on the keeper disappearances, the execution feels rushed and relies on telling over showing, hindering its overall impact and depth.</comment>
