<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation (duty vs. affection) is clear and drives the conflict, but the 'dry wit' attribute is minimally demonstrated. Marianne serves the plot but lacks deeper development beyond her indignation and connection to the waltz/ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent and achieves a complete arc within the word limit. The central action ('confiscate') effectively drives the climax, and the pacing is generally well-managed, moving logically from setup to resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is highly effective, creating a strong, gothic atmosphere enhanced by the storm. Sensory details are present and contribute well to the mood, integrating seamlessly with the plot and character motivations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story successfully evokes pathos and uses symbolism (rope, erosion) effectively. The central conflict is clear and the ending is purposeful, though perhaps leaning towards predictable sentimentality. The craft is solid, but lacks truly profound subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While possessing a unique element (the waltz), the story relies heavily on familiar tropes (haunted lighthouse, tragic ghost, duty-bound sentinel). The emotional portrayal feels somewhat standard, lacking deep nuance or a truly distinctive authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates competence in weaving assigned elements into a cohesive narrative. It achieves atmospheric consistency and emotional resonance, but ultimately feels constrained by genre conventions rather than transcending them with exceptional creativity or insight.</comment>
