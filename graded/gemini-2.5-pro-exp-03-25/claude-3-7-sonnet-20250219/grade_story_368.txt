<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The 'streetwise orphan' attribute feels somewhat superficial; while mentioned, Mira's actions lean more towards mystical intuition than demonstrated street smarts. Her motivation is clear but abstract ('harvest hope'), and while consistent, it doesn't fully leverage the 'streetwise' potential. Her voice is functional but lacks true distinction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent with a clear arc (discovery, ritual, resolution) driven effectively by the 'contrast' action and 'reversed patterns' method within the word limit. However, the resolution feels slightly convenient, and the 'constellation' detail remains underdeveloped, weakening the cause-and-effect chain slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The 'lost orchard temple' setting is evocative and well-integrated with the 'unwritten calendar' timeframe, creating a strong, mystical atmosphere. Sensory details are present and enhance the mood, effectively supporting the character's actions and the story's core concepts. The connection between the brooch and the temple setting is meaningful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (brooch, orchard, patterns) and explores themes of perception and transformation. The central conflict is clear and resolved purposefully. However, the impact relies heavily on the concept's neatness rather than deep emotional resonance or complex subtext; it shows competence but lacks profound depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While avoiding overt clich√©s and obvious AI tells, the story employs familiar mystical tropes (whispering stones, ancient pulse). Some phrasing ("forgotten promises," "fractured lens") feels polished but not entirely original. The core concept (curse as reversed blessing) has potential, but the execution doesn't feel groundbreaking or possess a truly unique authorial stamp.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story achieves reasonable cohesion, integrating the assigned elements without feeling entirely forced. The elements generally serve the narrative. However, it doesn't fully transcend the feeling of being constructed around constraints to achieve a sense of inevitable, organic storytelling. It's competent but lacks the spark of exceptional creativity needed for the highest tier.</comment>
