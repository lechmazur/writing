<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation (ennui, curiosity) is stated clearly but lacks deep resonance or nuance within the text; her 'exorcist' role sets up the premise effectively but doesn't profoundly shape her actions or voice in this specific climactic scene beyond providing context. The transition feels slightly abrupt given the stated risks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically from setup (receipt code) to infiltration and reveal/initiation, achieving a sense of arc. However, the crucial step ("By infiltrating secret clubs...") is told rather than shown, weakening the coherence of how she *arrived* at this specific point. Pacing is adequate for the length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is effectively built, blending the mundane (receipt) with the esoteric (tech shamans, ritualistic setting). The abandoned mess hall and specific timeframe detail enhance the clandestine mood. The "indifferent enthusiasm" tone permeates the gathering effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story presents a compelling, original concept ("social media exorcist," "digital hauntings") with effective metaphorical language. The ending twist offers subtext about the human source of digital phenomena. However, the impact is slightly lessened by the 'telling' of the infiltration method and somewhat direct statements of motivation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The core concept and terminology ("algorithmic ghosts," "tech shamans") feel fresh and avoid common tropes. The blend of technology and ritualistic elements is original. While mostly avoiding formulaic writing, some motivational phrasing feels slightly generic ("curiosity that demanded satisfaction").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive and intriguing narrative snapshot. The concept feels central, not forced. The brevity works, focusing on a pivotal moment of discovery and transition, leaving the reader with provocative questions about technology and human connection.</comment>
