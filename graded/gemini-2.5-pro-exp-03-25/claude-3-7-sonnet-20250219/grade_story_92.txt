<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Jasper's initial motivation (job security via silence) and attribute ("carefully careless") are clearly stated but less dynamically shown. The shift to the new motivation ("stand where fear dares not tread") feels abrupt, lacking sufficient internal transition for a character defined by avoidance. Mrs. Blackwood remains an archetype.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot establishes atmosphere and introduces conflict effectively within the word limit, achieving a clear mini-arc focused on Jasper's decision. However, the core action ("justify") feels relegated to slightly clunky backstory exposition via the blood drive memory, rather than driving the present narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Excellent synthesis of setting (haunted dining room), timeframe (twilight), and tone ("loud silence"). The atmosphere is thick and palpable, strongly supported by evocative sensory details (pulsing plants, viscous liquid) that enhance the core concept and character's unease. The world feels menacingly alive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong craft evident in atmospheric prose, effective use of imagery, and building suspense. The central conflict (Jasper's internal shift vs. external supernatural threat) is clear. The theme of willful ignorance versus confronting truth emerges well. The ending is a purposeful, intriguing cliffhanger.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>While the writing style is competent and avoids overt AI tells, the story leans heavily on familiar gothic tropes (haunted mansion, spectral guests, mysterious employer) without significant subversion. The "carefully careless" phrase repetition and the slightly predictable structure detract from a sense of true originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive and atmospheric whole. It demonstrates creative thinking in combining the specific character role with the gothic setting. While effective as a vignette, it feels more like a promising opening chapter than a completely self-contained, flawless piece ready for prestigious publication.</comment>
