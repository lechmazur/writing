<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Motivation feels asserted rather than organically revealed; the late introduction of the 'lost love' motive feels tacked on and underdeveloped. The 'rebellious' attribute isn't consistently demonstrated through nuanced action beyond the premise itself.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The plot attempts a complete arc but feels overstuffed and rushed within the word limit, particularly the climax and resolution. The connection between writing obituaries, the mask/organ manifestation, and the final choice regarding revolution lacks smooth transitions and clear causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and conceptually strong ('giant's bookshelf'), creating a unique atmosphere. However, the integration of the 'rumors of revolution' timeframe feels peripheral and doesn't significantly impact the core narrative beyond a brief mention.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Uses symbolism (mask, labyrinth) heavily, but the meaning feels explicitly stated by the end ("every obituary was a manifesto") rather than emerging subtly. The density of concepts hinders emotional resonance, and the 'lucid frenzy' tone feels somewhat forced through repetition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Language frequently borders on purple prose ("colossal," "monoliths," "feverish flame," "lucid frenzy"), feeling ornate rather than precise. The combination of disparate elements feels somewhat formulaic, like fulfilling a checklist, lacking deep originality or authentic emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story struggles under the weight of incorporating numerous specific elements within a tight word count, leading to strained cohesion. It feels more like an exercise built around the prompts than a naturally flowing narrative, hindering overall impact despite creative ambition.</comment>
