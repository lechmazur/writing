<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (promise) is clear but generic. The 'unjustly fair' attribute feels superficially applied rather than deeply integrated into actions or decisions. The rival operator remains largely undeveloped, weakening the central relationship's foundation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The plot progresses rapidly, relying heavily on the 'infect' concept both metaphorically and literally. The literal toxin infection feels abrupt and underdeveloped, straining coherence. The Morse code romance is intriguing but feels rushed to a resolution within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting provides initial atmosphere, but its specific elements don't deeply influence the core emotional plot beyond isolation. The 'broken treaties' timeframe adds context but remains underdeveloped. Sensory details are present but not consistently evocative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story attempts thematic depth with unconventional love amidst conflict, using butterflies symbolically. However, the execution feels somewhat heavy-handed, particularly the dual meaning of 'infect'. The ending is abrupt, sacrificing emotional resonance for plot resolution. Showing vs. telling is inconsistent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>While the combination of elements is unusual, the prose occasionally dips into clich√© ("crumbled like rusted metal," "lonely heart"). The sudden introduction of the literal toxin feels like a formulaic way to raise stakes rather than an organic development. Emotional nuance is often stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story struggles under the weight of its numerous assigned elements. While some integrations are clever (highlighter, butterflies), others feel forced (apothecary/toxin, unjustly fair), making the narrative feel constructed around constraints rather than flowing organically. The brevity exacerbates the underdeveloped aspects.</comment>
