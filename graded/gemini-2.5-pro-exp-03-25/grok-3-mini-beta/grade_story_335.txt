<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The character's core attribute ("carefully reckless") is stated but inconsistently demonstrated, feeling more like an applied label. The motivation shift from seeking a relic to seeking closure is abrupt and lacks sufficient internal development within the word count.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc, but the resolution (instant cessation of tremors upon discarding the amber) feels overly simplistic and unearned. The "improbable rumor chains" function as necessary exposition but lack narrative weight or integration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The setting and timeframe are effectively combined to create a strong, evocative atmosphere that aligns well with the character's internal state and the story's melancholic tone. Sensory details are present and contribute positively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story utilizes obvious symbolism (spider in amber) effectively enough, but the writing style occasionally becomes overwrought ("improbable longing," "echoing hour"). The central conflict's resolution feels too neat, limiting deeper thematic resonance or emotional impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Relies heavily on the haunted mercenary trope seeking redemption. Phrases like "carefully reckless" and "improbable longing" feel somewhat forced and artificial. The emotional arc follows a predictable template, and the resolution lacks nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>While managing to incorporate the elements, the story feels constrained by them rather than organically growing from them. The integration of certain elements (attribute, method) is weak, and the overly descriptive style sometimes obscures rather than clarifies, hindering overall cohesion.</comment>
