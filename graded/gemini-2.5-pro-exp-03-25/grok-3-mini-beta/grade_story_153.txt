<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation ("master of one's own reality") is clear, but the character's core attributes ("eternal college student," "detached devotion," "mundanely glorious") feel more stated than deeply embodied; her actions are consistent but lack nuanced psychological depth beyond the repeated "detached devotion."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent with a clear arc driven by the 'digitize' action via 'swapped journals'. However, the transformation feels somewhat abrupt within the word count, and the cause-effect relationship between digitizing memories and mastering reality could be more convincingly developed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The setting (underground city) and timeframe (post-stars) create a strong, unique atmosphere, effectively enhanced by details like the headlamp and fungi. The tone generally aligns, though the 'mundanely glorious' aspect feels less integrated into the atmosphere than the 'detached devotion'.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (headlamp, collapsed mine) and explores a clear theme (burden of immortality, transformation). However, the impact is lessened by repetitive phrasing ("detached devotion," "gifted burdens") and a tendency to state themes rather than fully embodying them through action and subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Significant repetition of key phrases ("detached devotion," "mundanely glorious," "gifted burdens") creates a formulaic feel, bordering on AI-like adherence to prompts. While the premise is original, the execution lacks stylistic individuality and nuanced emotional portrayal, relying on stated feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion despite numerous constraints, weaving elements together serviceably. However, the heavy repetition of assigned terms hinders stylistic flow and makes the elements feel somewhat imposed rather than organically arising from the narrative, preventing it from reaching top-tier quality.</comment>
