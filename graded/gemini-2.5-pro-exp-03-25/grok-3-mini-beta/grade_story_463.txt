<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The 'dry-witted' attribute feels asserted rather than demonstrated; dialogue is functional but lacks genuine wit. Motivation is clear but its connection to the initial list-crossing action is weak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc (list -> rope -> ghost -> resolution) driven by the 'confiscate' action, but feels compressed and reliant on exposition. The connection between the list and the subsequent events could be stronger.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting effectively creates atmosphere and supports the themes of isolation and forgotten lore. Sensory details are present but could be more evocative to fully immerse the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Symbolism (rope, dance) is clear but heavy-handed. The writing style attempts literary flair but occasionally becomes overwrought ("reckless precision," "sardonic precision"). The ending provides thematic closure but lacks strong emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Relies on tropes (haunted setting, stoic sentinel) without significant subversion. Repetitive phrasing ("eroding promises," "reckless precision") and somewhat generic descriptions hint at formulaic construction rather than unique authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story struggles under the weight of its assigned elements, feeling more like an exercise in incorporation than an organic narrative. Cohesion is attempted but feels forced, hindering overall impact.</comment>
