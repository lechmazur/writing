<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lila's motivation (tradition vs. doubt) is clear and drives her actions, but the 'glamorous' aspect feels superficial (only lace gloves). Her internal conflict is present but lacks profound depth for top-tier publication.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent with a clear arc within the word limit. However, the resolution via the single hidden photo feels slightly convenient, a common narrative shortcut to overcome algorithmic limitations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of the tactile (brass tape, paint) and the digital (archive, holograms) creates a strong atmosphere. Sensory details are effective, though the specified tone "jubilant remorse" is stated more than fully evoked atmospherically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully uses symbolism (tape, decay) and explores an intriguing theme about digital legacy and ordinariness. The central conflict is clear, but the ending, while purposeful, lacks the resonant punch expected of truly exceptional work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The core concept is highly original, blending tradition and technology effectively. The language is mostly strong and avoids obvious AI tells, though occasional phrases ("spectral silhouette") border on slightly overwrought. It avoids major clich√©s.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates impressive cohesion, integrating the disparate elements (brass tape in a digital archive, ancient tradition for modern data) into a unified and thought-provoking narrative. The brevity feels intentional, focusing the impact.</comment>
