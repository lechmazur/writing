<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (regret), but the character feels archetypal, and the 'grudgingly sweet' attribute is superficially applied rather than deeply integrated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot follows a discernible arc within the word limit, but relies on convenient fantasy logic (pattern reveals stairs) rather than intricate plotting; resolution feels abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric integration of the lighthouse/reef setting with the knight's internal state; however, the 'mirrored reflection' timeframe feels underdeveloped until the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (mirrors, knocker), but the central theme's final articulation ("joyfully embrace the agony") is overly explicit and diminishes subtextual impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Competent prose, but relies heavily on familiar tropes (haunted knight, symbolic quest items) and lacks a distinctive voice or truly fresh metaphors, bordering on generic fantasy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story cohesively incorporates the required elements, but feels more like a well-executed exercise than a work of profound originality or depth demanding publication.</comment>
