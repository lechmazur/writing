<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elena's rebellious attribute is shown, but her core motivation ("restore a lost art form") feels abstract and the connection between her initial "obituaries for the living" and the final "theater" manifestation is underdeveloped and abrupt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc, but the pacing is significantly rushed, cramming dense concepts and a rapid climax into the word limit, which undermines coherence and feels forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Evocative atmosphere and good use of sensory details, particularly sound. However, the "giant's bookshelf" setting, while intriguing, feels somewhat arbitrary and underdeveloped, lacking deeper integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Strong symbolic elements (mask, organ) and ambitious themes (choice, rebellion). However, the prose is overly dense, bordering on overwrought, and the final thematic statement ("become its elegy") feels too explicit and didactic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While combining disparate elements shows some ingenuity, the narrative relies on recognizable fantasy tropes and a self-consciously 'literary' style that feels strained rather than truly original or authentic. The density feels artificial.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story attempts an ambitious synthesis of elements, but feels constrained and breathless due to the word limit. It lacks the effortless flow and polish required; the elements feel somewhat jammed together rather than organically unified.</comment>
