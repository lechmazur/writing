<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "hesitant" aspect feels underdeveloped beyond the initial description; motivation (shattered hopes/brother) is present but lacks deep integration into moment-to-moment action beyond the symbolic mosaic collection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear but the assigned method ("via the rhythm of footsteps") feels poorly integrated into the core action ("judge"); it's used for mimicry/timing, not the judgment itself. The phoenix resolution feels abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric rendering through sensory details (hum, vibration, light pools); the dusk timeframe and resonance chamber setting effectively create mood and tension supporting the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective use of central symbolism (compass, mosaic, phoenix) and evocative imagery; the theme of rebuilding from brokenness is clear, though the literal manifestation of the phoenix slightly undermines the established realism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose generally avoids clich√© and AI tells, demonstrating some stylistic flair, but certain phrases ("motivation coiled," "mosaic of her motivation") verge on being overly literary, and the phoenix resolution employs a common fantasy trope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Achieves reasonable cohesion despite the constraints, but the integration of certain elements (notably the 'footsteps' method) feels superficial, preventing the piece from feeling entirely seamless or inevitable in its construction.</comment>
