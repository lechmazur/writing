<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation stemming from Lila's death and the map fragment is clear and drives his actions. The hairbrush serves as a potent symbol and tool, revealing his connection to Lila and his eventual understanding. However, his character feels slightly underdeveloped beyond his grief and mission; the "seasoned woodsman" aspect (Q7A) is barely present, replaced by a more specific focus on railways, weakening the assigned attribute's impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot structure is efficient within the word limit, establishing motivation, rising action (tower climb, echo attempt), climax (short-circuit, revelation), and resolution (finding coordinates, acceptance). The method (echo/radio waves via brush) is imaginative, though the short-circuit feels slightly convenient as a catalyst. Pacing is effective, delivering a complete arc despite the brevity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The "radio wave garden" setting is highly original and atmospheric, effectively integrated with the plot (mapping signals) and theme (hidden stories in static). Sensory details ("static hummed," "crackled with signals," "iron skin peeling") create a vivid, unique world. The atmosphere strongly supports the blend of grief, mystery, and pseudo-scientific exploration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves emotional resonance through Elias's grief and eventual acceptance. Symbolism (brush, railways, static) is strong and central to the narrative. The concept of railways as "stories etched in static" offers subtext. The ending provides closure, though the shift to acceptance feels slightly abrupt. The central conflict (grief vs. understanding/acceptance) is clear and resolved.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The core concept and setting feel original, avoiding common tropes. The blend of antique technology (hairbrush) and strange phenomena (radio garden) is unique. While the prose is generally strong, phrases like "lightning flashed inside his skull" verge on clich√©. The emotional arc, while present, resolves somewhat predictably. It avoids obvious AI tells but lacks deep, nuanced emotional complexity expected at the highest tier.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive, atmospheric whole. The hairbrush, radio garden, and mapping motivation are particularly well-utilized. The brevity feels purposeful, focusing the narrative effectively. The unique combination of elements results in a memorable piece, though minor weaknesses in character depth and plot convenience prevent a top score.</comment>
