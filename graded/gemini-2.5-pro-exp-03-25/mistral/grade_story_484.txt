<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Motivation ("embody values") is abstract and weakly connected to the specific actions. The "groggy brewer" trait feels superficial, barely influencing personality or choices beyond a vague connection to "bitter brews." The mirror symbolism is overt rather than subtle character revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The plot arc (discovery, confrontation, resolution) exists but feels rushed and simplistic within the word count. The connection between the external protest and Edgar's internal quest is tenuous and underdeveloped. The resolution (darkness receding, protestors changing) lacks sufficient build-up, making the cause-and-effect feel unearned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The graveyard setting establishes a basic gothic mood, but the "uniquely generic" attribute feels like an unfulfilled intellectual conceit. The "flippant solemnity" tone is stated but not consistently embodied in the prose. The protest timeframe feels disconnected from the core atmosphere and Edgar's internal journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Relies heavily on telling ("he felt a weight lift") rather than showing the transformation. Symbolism (darkness, mirror) is present but lacks subtlety. The central conflict's resolution is abrupt and overly neat. The writing style contains awkward phrases ("uniquely generic sense of dread," "flippant solemnity") that detract from impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The story leans on tropes (haunted mansion, internal darkness made manifest) without significant subversion. Phrases like "uniquely generic" and "flippant solemnity" feel artificial. The rapid emotional shift and resolution lack human nuance, feeling more like a narrative checklist than organic development. Predictable template.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The assigned elements often feel forced (especially the protest, "groggy brewer," "uniquely generic," "flippant solemnity") rather than organically integrated. The story struggles under the weight of these disparate components, hindering cohesion and depth. The brevity exacerbates the feeling of an underdeveloped concept.</comment>
