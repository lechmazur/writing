<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is stated but lacks demonstrated depth. The core attribute "rationally impulsive" is contradictory and poorly illustrated, weakening credibility. The "chameleon" aspect is asserted rather than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent (setup -> investigation -> preparation), but the progression feels formulaic and the central investigation method (solving cold cases) feels somewhat contrived as the path to the stated action (reproducing truth). Pacing is adequate but lacks dynamism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The setting, timeframe, and tone work reasonably well together to create a consistent atmosphere. However, sensory details are present but not exceptionally vivid or immersive, limiting the world's impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing, particularly regarding Wei's motivations and the societal state. Symbolism (sunlight, dress) is overt. While attempting thematic depth, the execution lacks subtlety and profound emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Significant reliance on clich√©s ("echoing chamber," "tapestry of humanity," "performance of a lifetime") and somewhat generic descriptions. The prose lacks a distinctive voice, and the combination of elements feels constructed rather than organic or truly original.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story achieves basic cohesion but feels more like an interesting premise or prologue than a complete, impactful narrative. Several elements, particularly the character attribute and method, feel superficially integrated rather than essential drivers of a compelling story.</comment>
