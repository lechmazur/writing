<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The assigned 'spineless' trait is unconvincing and underdeveloped, seemingly contradicted by the character's 'profound influence' and central role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot lacks dynamism and a sense of completion; crucially, the assigned 'method' (tears on photos) feels entirely disconnected from how influence is actually exerted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Awkward jargon ('statically dynamic'), repetition ('faint shimmer'), and reliance on stated/atmospheric emotion over nuanced character action suggest artificiality and detract from authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>While atmospherically successful, the piece is significantly weakened by the forced, poorly integrated 'spineless' attribute and 'tears/photos' method, preventing overall cohesion.</comment>
