<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Motivation ("wrath of a star") feels abstract and disconnected from the character's actions and the theme of imperfection; the "smiling" aspect is superficial.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc, but the mechanism of sabotage (flashlight causing sparks/re-ignition) lacks credibility and coherence, weakening cause/effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and atmospheric, strongly supporting the mood, though the integration of the "angry peace" tone is weak until the very end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Relies heavily on explicitly stating themes ("beauty of imperfection," "power of imperfection") rather than showing them; symbolism (flashlight) is somewhat heavy-handed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>While the combination of elements is unusual, the prose contains clich√©s ("relic of simpler times," "beacon in the night") and the core motivation feels generic/unearned, lacking unique authorial insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Several elements, particularly the motivation ("wrath of a star") and the specific method of sabotage, feel forced rather than organically serving a cohesive narrative vision.</comment>
