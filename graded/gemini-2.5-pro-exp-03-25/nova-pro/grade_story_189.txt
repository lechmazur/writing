<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The 'uniquely literal' attribute is asserted but not demonstrated; character actions are driven by external clues (notes, maps) rather than a distinct internal processing style. Motivation is clear but lacks depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically from clue to action to discovery, achieving a basic arc, but the mechanism of receiving clues (notes under doors) feels contrived and lacks integration with the established world elements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The haunted basement atmosphere is adequately evoked, but its connection to the post-war timeframe and the core concept of star maps feels tenuous and underdeveloped. The water war context adds nothing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Relies heavily on telling ("felt a surge of understanding") rather than showing. The ending delivers information bluntly, lacking subtext or resonant emotional impact. Conflict is present but resolved too neatly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a predictable discovery template using common tropes (ancient maps, mysterious key, hidden room) without fresh twists. Character reasoning is plot-functional rather than nuanced. Language is functional but lacks a distinctive voice or style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The disparate elements (post-war, ghosts, star maps, phone key) feel superficially stitched together rather than organically integrated. The story seems constructed *around* the prompts, hindering cohesion and depth.</comment>
