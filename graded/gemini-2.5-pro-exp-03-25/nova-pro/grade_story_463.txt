<question>1</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The assigned 'dry-witted' trait is entirely absent in the character's actions or internal monologue; his motivation shifts abruptly from sentinel duty to learning dance without convincing development.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The plot hinges on the convenient discovery of a note, rendering the initial setup (list, sentinel duty) largely irrelevant; the transition to the dance resolution feels rushed and disconnected from the beginning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The 'haunted lighthouse' atmosphere is established using standard tropes (creaking halls, dust, ghosts), but the initial 'keeper's bedroom' setting is quickly abandoned and feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Relies heavily on telling ("He realized that the dance was a symbol...") rather than showing; symbolism (rope, dance) is overt and lacks subtlety, diminishing potential impact and subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The narrative feels formulaic, combining disparate elements (sentinel, ghost dance, frayed rope) in a predictable manner; lacks a unique voice and relies on generic descriptions and emotional statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The story struggles significantly with cohesion, feeling more like an exercise in incorporating assigned elements than an organically conceived narrative; the elements often dictate the plot awkwardly rather than serving it.</comment>
