<question>1</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Character feels underdeveloped; "arrogant" and "doubtfully confident" are stated but not convincingly demonstrated through nuanced action or internal thought. Motivation is generic ("deliver a spark") and the transformation is abrupt and unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The plot relies heavily on overt symbolism rather than organic development. The connection between the song (method) and severing metaphorical chains (action: "authorize") is tenuous and abstract. The arc is present but feels rushed and superficial within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The setting (calligraphy courtyard) offers potential contrast but remains largely atmospheric backdrop, not deeply integrated. The "harsh tenderness" tone is asserted rather than evoked through sensory detail or specific narrative choices. The timeframe "between breaths" is used but lacks significant impact on pacing or tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Relies heavily on telling ("internal struggle," "newfound freedom") instead of showing. Symbolism (tapestry, song, chains) is heavy-handed and lacks subtlety. The emotional impact is muted due to abstract language and a predictable, almost didactic ending. The theme is explicitly stated rather than emerging organically.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>Language feels somewhat stilted and relies on clich√©s ("whirlwind of thoughts," "symphony of colors," "etched in the ink"). The transformation follows a predictable template. Emotion is stated ("doubtfully confident") rather than shown through nuanced behaviour. Lacks a distinctive authorial voice or originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The story feels constructed *around* the assigned elements rather than using them organically. Cohesion suffers due to the forced integration of abstract concepts and symbolic actions. The brevity highlights the lack of depth rather than feeling like a deliberate, impactful choice.</comment>
