<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The 'morbid florist' and 'neutrally passionate' attributes are stated but not convincingly demonstrated through action or internal monologue; motivation is clear but generic, lacking unique character voice or depth revealed through interactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc, but the central method (typed pages in a trunk) feels incongruous with the setting and weakens coherence; the 'oblige' action feels inserted late rather than driving the plot organically.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The 'floating rock dojo' and 'guttering lantern' create a potentially strong atmosphere, but the connection between setting, character, and the specific method (writer's trunk) feels tenuous, limiting immersive world-building.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Relies heavily on telling emotions and significance ("She felt a connection," "resolve strengthened") rather than showing; symbolism (candle) is present but lacks subtlety; the central conflict is purely internal and resolved too easily, lacking compelling tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a predictable enlightenment arc with clich√© elements (enigmatic master, sudden understanding); language sometimes veers into generic descriptors ("ancient rhythm," "whispered secrets"); the combination of elements feels forced rather than original.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The story struggles to cohesively integrate disparate elements, particularly the writer's trunk, making it feel more like an exercise in inclusion than an organic narrative; style is functional but lacks distinction; fails to leave a lasting impact.</comment>
