<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "apathetic" aspect of his initial "apathetic eagerness" is not fully convincing against his meticulous actions, making the emotional starting point slightly less solid than desired for flawless characterization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The premise is highly original, yet the narrative leans on repetitive key phrases ("urgings of the soul," "apathetic eagerness") and some overly direct psychological summations ("protective armor") that feel expository rather than wholly organic.</comment>
