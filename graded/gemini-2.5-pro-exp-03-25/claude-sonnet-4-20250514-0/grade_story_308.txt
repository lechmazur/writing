<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Coherent transformation arc, but the assigned "flinch" is a minor beat, and key dialogue feels slightly too expository for top-tier subtlety.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Impressively cohesive and creative weaving of disparate elements into a poignant narrative, though minor refinements would elevate it to "flawless."</comment>
