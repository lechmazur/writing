<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's "flighty" attribute is effectively reframed as a strength, driving her unique method. Her motivation to create a legacy is clear and consistent, though the Guild Master remains a somewhat functional antagonist rather than a deeply developed character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with the action "linearize" serving as a strong central verb for Mira's efforts. The reveal stemming from her method is logical and provides a clear climax and resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The "secret society initiation hall" setting is well-utilized, directly enabling the "hidden details in paintings" method. The initial "strangely normal" attribute of the hall effectively contrasts with its later "sacred" feel, enhancing the story's transformative theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (patch, paintings as maps) to explore themes of legacy and the value of unconventional perspectives. The ending offers a satisfying sense of purpose for Mira, and the central conflict is resolved neatly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>While the "outsider proves worth" narrative is a known trope, the specific execution through cartographic secrets in paintings offers a degree of freshness. The prose is clear and purposeful, largely avoiding generic phrasing or excessive ornamentation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The assigned elements are woven together cohesively, each contributing meaningfully to the narrative's progression and thematic depth. The story feels complete and thoughtfully constructed within its concise form, leaving a resonant final impression.</comment>
