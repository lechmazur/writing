<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Key attribute "rationally emotional" is asserted rather than deeply demonstrated, particularly the "rational" aspect; smuggler background feels superficial.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot is functional but thin; the core concept "distant companionship" has a very passive role, minimally impacting plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Setting is evocative and symbolically potent (map tear), but some supernatural descriptions verge on generic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Over-reliance on directly stating key emotional states ("jubilant despair") and traits diminishes subtlety; showing vs. telling imbalance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing of core concepts ("jubilant despair," "rationally emotional") and reliance on some common tropes without fresh subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>While elements are combined, the execution lacks the nuance and depth required for top-tier publication; interesting ideas are stated too baldly.</comment>
