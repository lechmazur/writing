<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character's pivotal 'deeply superficial' attribute is revealed through exposition (the notations) rather than being organically demonstrated through her prior actions or deeper internal reflections before the discovery, slightly weakening her agency in the initial self-understanding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot relies on a somewhat convenient 'magical discovery' (the fortune teller's booth with explicit notations) to deliver the central thesis, which feels more like a direct explanatory mechanism than a subtly integrated or character-driven revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The 'floating library' setting, existing 'across the boundary between real and myth,' creates a highly evocative and thematically resonant atmosphere, which is a distinct strength and masterfully supports the knight's internal journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a potent thematic impact regarding the nature of true heroism and connection, with strong subtext. However, while generally polished, some phrasing and metaphors ("tears fell like rain") tread familiar literary ground, slightly dulling the edge of absolute craft perfection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The core concept of 'consistent miracles' breeding numbness offers an original and insightful premise. This originality is somewhat tempered by the reliance on a common fantasy trope (a revelatory artifact/text—the booth—explaining the paradox) for its central explication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative is thematically cohesive and achieves significant emotional resonance. However, the critical plot point involving the fortune teller's booth feels like a didactic shortcut, a slightly too-direct means of delivering the story's message in an otherwise nuanced and introspective piece.</comment>
