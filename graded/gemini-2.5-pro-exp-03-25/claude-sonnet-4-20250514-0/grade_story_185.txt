<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Magnus remains more archetypal than deeply nuanced; his defining "infuriatingly calm" trait is asserted but lacks profound interactive impact beyond simple contrast with Chen's brief panic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The pivotal "decoding" process is underdeveloped and merely stated, while the grand resolution ("proofs...rewrote themselves") feels overly convenient and lacks satisfying mechanical depth for truly top-tier fiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the setting's high-tech/ancient-artifact juxtaposition is effective, the overall atmosphere relies more on conceptual tension than exceptionally vivid or unique sensory details; the assigned "fractured grace" tone is more a character descriptor than a pervasive narrative mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The core theme of "buried talents" is compelling and the premise unique; however, some grand conceptual leaps are asserted with more flourish than earned substance, slightly diminishing the intellectual resonance for a highly discerning audience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The central conceit regarding mundane artifacts is strikingly original and its greatest strength, yet it's framed within a somewhat familiar "ancient wisdom vs. modern crisis" structure, and minor repetition of key thematic words ("probability," "talent") slightly blunts the edge of otherwise fresh prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story showcases a commendably creative and cohesive vision, particularly for its brevity; however, for the most competitive publications, the execution of some crucial plot mechanics and conceptual underpinnings could be more rigorously developed to avoid any hint of narrative convenience.</comment>
