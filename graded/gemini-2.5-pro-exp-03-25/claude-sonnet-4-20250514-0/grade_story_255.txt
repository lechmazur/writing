<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's "seer" aspect as pattern recognition and her core motivation are strong and consistent; however, her "nondescript" attribute is stated rather than actively utilized or explored in its impact on her actions beyond basic implication.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear and satisfying arc within the word limit, but the coherence is slightly weakened by the dual, somewhat redundant justification (both rain-guided intuition and prior methodical research pinpointing the exact same hidden panel).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptionally strong; the integration of the abandoned control tower setting and the post-party timeframe, enriched by potent sensory details (especially the petrichor), masterfully creates a compelling and supportive atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story achieves significant impact through skillful use of literary devices, particularly symbolism (rain, relic) and evocative imagery, and explores a resonant theme of delayed justice with satisfying depth for its length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative largely feels authentic and original in its style, though the specific mechanism of the rain "leading" Maya to a panel *already* predicted by her research feels like a slightly forced element, hinting at a minor contrivance rather than seamless originality at that juncture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story is highly cohesive and elements generally serve the narrative well, creating a lingering impact; however, the minor logical inconsistency regarding the panel's discovery prevents it from achieving flawless integration.</comment>
