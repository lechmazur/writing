<question>5</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The core discovery method is inventive, but the story leans on tired tropes and the forced, awkward repetition of "rigidly flexible" smacks of artificiality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The story's ambitious premise is crippled by a central miraculous discovery that lacks grounding, making the overall structure feel contrived despite moments of evocative imagery.</comment>
