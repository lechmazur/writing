<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strength: Motivation is exceptionally clear and consistently drives her actions. Weakness: The defining attribute ("dizzyingly grounded") and "quiet" aspect feel somewhat asserted rather than seamlessly, profoundly embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strength: Achieves a strong sense of completeness and thematic resolution within the tight word limit. Weakness: The plot connection between "method" (masks) and "action" (carbonize) is more thematic discovery than direct operational linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strength: The liminal setting is powerfully realized and deeply intertwined with character motivation and themes. Weakness: Sensory details, while fitting, could be sharper or more uniquely evocative to reach the absolute highest tier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strength: Exceptionally strong and consistent use of integrated symbolism (mirror, masks, puzzles) creates rich layers. Weakness: Key thematic concepts are sometimes stated directly, slightly reducing the impact of pure showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strength: The narrative successfully blends disparate elements into a unique and memorable premise. Weakness: Some central descriptive phrases ("dizzyingly grounded," "noble foolishness") feel self-consciously literary, bordering on authorial labels.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strength: Remarkable cohesion achieved in weaving numerous specific assigned elements into a resonant narrative. Weakness: Thematic declarations, while clear, can feel slightly overt for the most demanding literary standards favoring subtlety.</comment>
