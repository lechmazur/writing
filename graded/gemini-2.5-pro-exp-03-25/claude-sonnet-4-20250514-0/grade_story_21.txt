<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strength: Chen's "abrasive calm" and subverted diplomat role are well-realized. Weakness: Webb's characterization is functional but lacks depth, serving primarily as a target.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strength: The plot is tightly paced and delivers a clear, grim resolution. Weakness: The central revenge arc, while well-executed with novel details, remains structurally conventional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strength: The decaying city hall and musty children's theatre, contrasted with distant drum circles, create a vivid, highly effective, and symbolic atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strength: Sharp, purposeful prose and impactful irony (e.g., "unconventional solutions"). Weakness: Key thematic statements like "The irony is exquisite" are slightly too direct for highest literary subtlety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strength: The core concept of scientific, DNA-targeted revenge by a diplomat is original. Weakness: Some dialogue ("Business is business") and the bandit archetype feel somewhat clich√©d.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strength: Excellent cohesion of thematic elements and narrative components into a polished, chilling story. Weakness: For the absolute top tier, it might require even greater thematic resonance or formal innovation.</comment>
