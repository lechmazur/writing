<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Kessie's "overzealous" trait is asserted rather than compellingly demonstrated through varied actions; her internal conflict with the notebook is brief, and her character arc, while present, feels somewhat accelerated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot effectively uses the "grandmother's secrets" concept but relies on "chance encounters" for key revelations, somewhat diminishing active discovery; the resolution, while fitting, feels slightly compressed for its significance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The "urban orchard on a repurposed highway" setting is exceptionally imaginative and vividly realized, enhanced by the "after the last human dream" timeframe, creating a strong, unique atmosphere.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves commendable cohesion, effectively weaving its assigned elements into a resonant narrative that feels purposeful despite its brevity, leaving a distinct impression.</comment>
