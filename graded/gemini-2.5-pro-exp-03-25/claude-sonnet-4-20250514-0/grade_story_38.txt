<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The "poet" aspect is well-integrated and drives her methodology; however, the "insomniac" trait feels somewhat underutilized beyond facilitating her presence in the attic. Her motivation for non-violence is clear but its genesis could be more deeply explored if space allowed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a commendable arc and coherence within the word limit, effectively using the "eliminate" action thematically. The mechanism for accessing and observing the after-parties feels slightly convenient, a minor point in an otherwise well-structured narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The "haunted attic" setting is evocative and its metaphorical transformation is a strength. Sensory details are generally good. The specified "empty abundance" tone is effectively presented as the *target* of critique rather than the narrative's own pervasive atmosphere, which is more introspective and resolute.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story achieves significant impact through potent imagery (e.g., "future ghosts," "poem in pressed petals") and a compelling central theme of art as activism. The reinterpretation of the "whispers" as nature's memory is particularly strong and thought-provoking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and avoids overt AI tells, with fresh metaphors and a nuanced handling of Maya's internal state. The core concept of botanical memory as whispers offers strong originality, though the "villainous corporation" is a familiar trope, albeit handled with a unique protagonist response.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates impressive cohesion, weaving its assigned elements into a purposeful and resonant narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, focusing on a pivotal moment of decision and inspiration, leaving a lingering sense of determined hope.</comment>
