<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear, but the character's internal transformation hinges on a somewhat convenient "flaw-to-strength" pivot; centuries of regret are resolved with a swiftness that feels more plot-driven than deeply excavated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Coherent arc, but the resolution of profound, long-standing conflict feels overly swift and convenient, undermining the scale of the preceding damnation and separation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric contrast and good use of sensory details, particularly the changing flames, effectively support the theme; the "infernal kitchen" setting is functional but not uniquely developed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism and a clear thematic message, but the emotional impact is somewhat muted by reliance on familiar romantic/redemptive tropes; craft is evident, but true depth feels slightly elusive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Relies heavily on a common central trope (fallen being/angelic redemption) with a symbolic resolution that, while fitting, lacks subtlety. The language, while aiming high, sometimes feels self-consciously literary rather than effortlessly original.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>A cohesive and thematically resonant vignette, but its reliance on established tropes and a somewhat facile resolution prevents it from achieving true distinction or flawless execution demanded at the highest tier.</comment>
