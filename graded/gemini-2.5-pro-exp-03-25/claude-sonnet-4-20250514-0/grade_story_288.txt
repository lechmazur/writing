<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strength: The blacksmith’s core motivation (“to create a work of art that transcends time” as an extension of parenthood) is poignant and well-integrated. Weakness: Dr. Chen remains largely a functional character, and Maya's preternatural understanding is more asserted than fully demonstrated through nuanced interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strength: The story achieves a clear and emotionally resonant arc (apprehension to hope) within the tight word limit. Weakness: The introduction of "a shared love for stand-up paddleboarding" as a narrative bridge feels somewhat coincidental and slightly forced as a plot device, rather than an entirely organic development.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strength: The "ozone monitoring station" and the "tattered flag" are powerfully evocative, creating a strong atmosphere of decay, resilience, and fragile hope. Weakness: The readily available leisure of paddleboarding on a "pristine mountain lake" slightly undercuts the consistently maintained severity of the "isolated wilderness" and "environmental collapse."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strength: The symbolism, particularly the forged paddleboarder sculpture and the tattered flag, is deeply resonant and effectively conveys subtext. Weakness: The final metaphor ("his daughter would learn to fly") is somewhat overly explicit, slightly diminishing the subtlety appropriate for the highest literary tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strength: The story largely avoids formulaic writing, presenting a unique combination of post-apocalyptic elements with a craftsman's perspective and intimate parental concerns. Weakness: The "shared love for stand-up paddleboarding" as a bonding mechanism, while functional, borders on a convenient trope rather than a deeply original or nuanced character interaction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strength: The story demonstrates considerable creative thinking in melding disparate elements into a cohesive and emotionally affecting narrative. Weakness: The "method" (shared love for stand-up paddleboarding) feels slightly less organically integrated than other core elements, appearing more as a convenient narrative joint.</comment>
