<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Maya's core concept is intriguing (necromancer-scientist), and her motivation to map is clear. However, "the sound of resolve" is more stated than deeply shown within this brief narrative, and Jake remains a very functional, underdeveloped character. The motivation "dominate the challenge" is somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot has a clear mini-arc with the discovery. However, the assigned "method" of "a shared love for old movies" is very weakly connected to the actual action of mapping the cave; it serves as character background rather than a direct method for achieving the plot's goal. Necromancy as a method is well-integrated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The "crystalline cave" setting is vividly evoked and atmospheric, strongly supporting the narrative. The "futuristic nostalgia" tone is well-established. The primary weakness is the awkward and unclear phrasing "scarcely abundant" used to describe the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story offers some good imagery and an intriguing blend of science and mysticism. However, the thematic message about "boundaries meant to be crossed" is delivered rather explicitly, lacking the subtlety preferred in top-tier literary work. Dialogue is functional but not exceptionally sharp.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The central premise of a necromantic geologist is original. However, the piece is marred by some generic descriptive phrases ("ethereal blue glow") and, most notably, the clunky and confusing assigned attribute "scarcely abundant," which reads unnaturally. The action "dominate" also feels somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story attempts to weave its assigned elements into a cohesive whole with a unique premise. While the core idea is creative, the execution is hampered by the awkwardness of certain assigned elements (notably "scarcely abundant") and a tenuous integration of "shared love for old movies" as a direct plot method, preventing it from feeling truly "flawless."</comment>
