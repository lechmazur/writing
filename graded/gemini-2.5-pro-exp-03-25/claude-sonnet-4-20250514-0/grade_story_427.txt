<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Meridian is reasonably developed, but Vance is more a functional foil, and the mechanical arm's specific plot-driving feature (stress-activated recording) feels somewhat convenient rather than deeply integrated into his persona beyond a plot device.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot effectively uses 'deconstruct' to drive toward a clear revelation, achieving a sense of completeness; however, the 'secret revealed under duress' via the arm's specific recording function is a slightly contrived mechanism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned lighthouse setting is powerfully evocative and thematically resonant; the 'hush of unexpected applause' serves as a striking, albeit slightly theatrical, atmospheric and narrative punctuation point.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story is highly imaginative with potent symbolism (the sock, the lighthouse) and provokes thought, but the dialogue leans towards declamation, and the philosophical density occasionally overshadows narrative flow for a piece this short.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The central conceit of the quantum sock and dream-threads is strikingly original, avoiding most tropes; however, the consistently elevated, formal prose, while fitting, sometimes verges on being overly ornate for such a concise piece.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The disparate elements are impressively interwoven into a cohesive and thought-provoking whole, showcasing strong creative integration; the story successfully builds a unique world and idea within its brief scope, leaving a lingering impact.</comment>
