<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear, but deeper emotional resonance and the "unspoken bond's" initial showing are somewhat underdeveloped for top-tier publication.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a commendable arc within the word limit, but the "administrators" feel like a superficial obstacle, and the resolution's mechanics are abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The archive setting is conceptually strong and atmospheric, but the specific attribute "practically rare" is an awkward phrasing, marring an otherwise effective description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story crafts compelling imagery (e.g., migrating frequencies) and explores an intriguing theme, but occasionally states emotional beats ("desperate hope made manifest") rather than fully embodying them.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of sacred geometry and migration patterns is highly original, yet some phrases ("theoretical dust") and the conveniently broadcasting mentor lean into familiar territory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story weaves its disparate elements into a cohesive and imaginative whole, but the resolution feels slightly too neat and reliant on abstract actions for truly flawless execution.</comment>
