<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character's "irate" attribute is stated but less convincingly demonstrated through action than her profound internal revolt and longing, making that specific trait feel somewhat underdeveloped in her portrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, though the introduced external threat (security drones) contributes minimally to palpable tension or obstacles overcome.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The desolate, decaying spaceport setting is exceptionally well-realized, creating a potent atmosphere that powerfully contrasts with and elevates the character's quest for natural purity; sensory details are strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>While the story offers impactful symbolism and a resonant theme, certain descriptive phrases (e.g., "abstractly physical," "voice cracking with years of suppressed longing") lean towards being slightly overwrought or self-conscious, preventing ultimate stylistic polish.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates considerable originality in its fusion of a gritty sci-fi milieu with a deeply personal, almost spiritual quest, largely subverting common tropes for its core elements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative achieves strong cohesion and creatively integrates its assigned elements into a resonant whole; however, minor imprecisions in character emphasis and occasional stylistic choices prevent it from reaching flawless execution.</comment>
