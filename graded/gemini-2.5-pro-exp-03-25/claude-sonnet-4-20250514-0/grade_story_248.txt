<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strength: Clear character arc and motivation shift. Weakness: The "coyly" aspect of the "coyly furious" attribute is underdeveloped in portrayal; "unsteady" is primarily physical rather than a deeply explored psychological facet.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strength: Tight, coherent plot with a clear arc from misapprehension to revelation, driven effectively by the bird's action and the method of discovery. Pacing is well-managed for the word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strength: Exceptionally evocative world-building and atmosphere; sensory details ("rusted bulkhead," "metallic snow") and the juxtaposition of the decaying station with cosmic events create a powerful, immersive mood perfectly supporting the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strength: Achieves significant thematic impact, particularly regarding fate and destructive creation, using potent symbolism. Weakness: Some key emotional states ("coyly furious expression betrayed," "cheerless ecstasy bubbled up") are stated more than consistently shown through nuanced action or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strength: The writing style is consistent and fitting, largely avoiding generic or machine-like phrasing. Weakness: Employs some recognizable sci-fi tropes (misinterpreted prophecy, grand cosmic pronouncements like "terrible beauty of cosmic truth") without substantial fresh subversion or deeper nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strength: Demonstrates highly cohesive integration of disparate elements into a thematically resonant narrative; the story feels complete and purposeful within its concise form, leaving a strong ironic impact.</comment>
