<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Attribute "openly secretive" more stated than deeply shown; character's emotional processing of profound trauma is very rapid.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot hinges on a highly convenient diary discovery; the maelstrom, while atmospheric, lacks direct influence on core plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Atmospherically strong, but the maelstrom's specific function beyond general turmoil is ill-defined; sensory details are competent but not consistently striking.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Core concept is powerful; however, antagonist motivation ("men who claimed such knowledge was dangerous") is generic and emotional resolutions feel abrupt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While avoiding overt AI tells, the narrative relies on the familiar trope of memory recovery via convenient artifact and some descriptive language is standard rather than uniquely vivid.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Ambitious thematic scope within a short form; however, this compression results in somewhat superficial treatment of significant emotional and societal upheavals.</comment>
