<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "phobia-ridden" aspect drives the arc effectively; "stunt double" remains underdeveloped, a missed opportunity for deeper thematic resonance beyond a superficial skill mention.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Coherent and complete arc achieved within the word limit. The inciting "envelope with coordinates" is a functional but somewhat standard plot device, lacking fresh execution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The pyramid library atmosphere is strong and supports the core concept; however, some descriptive details for an ancient library ("crumbling scrolls") feel generic rather than uniquely envisioned.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The net metaphor is impactful and the theme of confronting fear is clear; however, the overall emotional journey relies on some direct exposition of feelings rather than purely showing them through nuanced action or internal thought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The prayer-woven net is a genuinely original core element; this strength is somewhat offset by several instances of familiar phrasing and a conventional "treasure map" setup that dilute its claim to thorough originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>A competent story with a strong central image and thematic clarity. For the highest tier of publication, it needs more consistent originality in language and to move beyond certain narrative shortcuts to feel truly exceptional.</comment>
