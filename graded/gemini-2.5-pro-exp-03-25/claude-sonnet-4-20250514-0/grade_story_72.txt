<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The envoy's transformation from "centuries of diplomatic failures" and ingrained cynicism, while narratively clear, feels somewhat rapid; the "sneering" aspect is established but not deeply woven into his ongoing internal state before the shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot is efficiently constructed, achieving a clear and satisfying arc with a well-placed turning point ("deliberately obscured") that propels the narrative effectively within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptionally strong world-building; the vivid, contrasting imagery ("burgundy shadows," "swirling aurora," "bioluminescent patterns") and sensory details create a deeply immersive and thematically resonant atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story achieves significant thematic depth concerning evolution and obsolescence, evoking reflection through strong symbolism (the note, the starlight) and an impactful, resonant ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The core sci-fi concept of human photosynthetic evolution offers a notable originality, and the prose is largely distinctive, though a minor repetition ("swirling leaves") and occasional direct exposition slightly temper its claim to flawlessness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable cohesion, artfully weaving its assigned elements into a thematically rich narrative that feels purposeful and leaves a lingering sense of wonder, making excellent use of its constrained length.</comment>
