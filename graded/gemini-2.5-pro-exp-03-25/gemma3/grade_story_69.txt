<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Tiber's core motivation (forging beauty from anarchy) and method (attending auditions) are clear and drive his actions. However, the "uncertain druid" aspect feels underdeveloped and doesn't significantly impact his behaviour beyond a vague connection to nature (wildflowers).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story presents a concise and coherent micro-narrative arc (collecting energy, applying it, resolution) within the word limit. The cause-effect relationship between the collected 'static' and the stabilized hologram provides a clear, albeit fantastical, plot mechanism. Pacing is effective for a vignette.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The hologram repair shop setting ("ozone and regret") provides a strong, evocative atmosphere that contrasts intriguingly with Tiber's nature-adjacent character. However, the "library hours" timeframe feels arbitrary and disconnected from the central scene and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (lunch tin, hummingbird) and explores the theme of finding value in brokenness effectively. The central concept is unique, and the ending provides satisfying closure for the scene while reinforcing the ongoing nature of Tiber's pursuit. Shows potential for subtext regarding art, hope, and failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The core concept (emotional static from auditions fixing holograms via a druid-like figure) is highly original and avoids common tropes. While generally well-written, some phrasing ("weathered, an uncertain druid more comfortable with root systems than people") borders on slightly mannered prose for this critical standard.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive and atmospheric vignette. The central conceit feels imaginative, and the brief length works well for the focused interaction. It leaves the reader with a distinct mood and lingering thematic questions.</comment>
