<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Eira's core motivation (archiving emotions) is clear and well-integrated, but the 'rogue fortune teller' label feels superficial and slightly discordant with her actual function. Valerius serves his purpose but lacks significant depth or distinct voice beyond his immediate need.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a quiet, coherent arc within the word limit, effectively using the 'unspoken offer' concept. However, the overall narrative is slight, relying heavily on atmosphere over event; the 'zigzag' action feels specific but somewhat arbitrary as a signal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The reimagined longhouse setting and 'overlooked era' timeframe create a strong, specific atmosphere, enhanced by effective sensory details (resins, wine, wood). The mood effectively supports the core concept and character interactions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story succeeds in establishing a unique concept and utilizing subtext (the unspoken transaction). Symbolism (inkwell) is potent. However, the emotional impact feels muted, and the quiet ending might lack the resonance required for the highest tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The core concept of emotional archiving offers strong originality. The prose avoids obvious clich√©s and AI tells, but some descriptive phrases ("fierce repose," "modestly flashy") feel slightly constructed or overly stylized rather than organically arising from the narrative voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Most elements integrate well to create a cohesive mood piece. The central concept is compelling. However, the 'fortune teller' aspect feels less essential, slightly weakening the overall synergy. The brevity works, but borders on feeling like a fragment rather than a fully self-contained story.</comment>
