<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The character's awkwardness and motivation are clear and drive his chosen method (indirect communication via postcard), but the 'swordsman' attribute feels entirely superficial and disconnected from his actions and internal thoughts, weakening the overall portrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot structure achieves a clear arc (inciting incident -> realization -> action) within the word limit, and the hermit crab method provides a logical, if somewhat convenient, catalyst for the protagonist's shift. Pacing is adequate, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting (frigid tundra orchard with geothermal vents) is highly evocative and effectively integrated, creating a strong atmosphere that contrasts the cold bureaucracy with natural warmth, directly supporting the central conflict and Tiber's eventual idea.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (postcard, crabs, vents) to convey its theme of integration and adaptation. The central conflict is clear, and the ending offers a quiet, purposeful resonance, though it lacks truly groundbreaking insight or profound emotional depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While avoiding overt purple prose, the writing occasionally uses slightly predictable phrasing ("fragile promise," "ghostly embrace"). The core metaphor (hermit crabs) is functional but not strikingly original. The 'swordsman' element feels like an inorganic inclusion, hinting at potential formulaic constraints.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Most assigned elements cohere reasonably well, serving the narrative, but the 'hesitant swordsman' aspect feels poorly integrated, slightly undermining the overall cohesiveness. The story successfully uses its brevity, but doesn't quite transcend its components to achieve exceptional synergy.</comment>
