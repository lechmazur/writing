<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (peace with past) feels somewhat generic for the archetype; the 'shaky' trait is mentioned but underutilized in action, and 'carefully reckless' is stated rather than demonstrated effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear, albeit familiar, arc (transaction leading to new quest) within the word limit, but the initiating method ('improbable rumor chains') serves only as backstory exposition rather than an active element.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The setting (collapsed cathedral) and timeframe ('echoing hour') combine effectively to create a strong, evocative atmosphere that supports the story's mood and themes of decay and hidden potential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Uses symbolism (amber, map) effectively and establishes a clear theme, but the overall emotional impact is somewhat muted, and the dialogue serves function over distinction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Relies heavily on recognizable tropes (haunted mercenary, mysterious quest) and some slightly worn phrasing ('life lived in the shadows', 'silhouette against the dying light'), lacking a truly distinctive voice or original perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The elements are integrated cohesively, but the story doesn't fully transcend the feeling of assembling familiar components; it fulfills the prompt competently but lacks the spark of exceptional originality or depth required for the highest tier.</comment>
