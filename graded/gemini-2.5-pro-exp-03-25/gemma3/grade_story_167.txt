<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character feels archetypal; the 'dutiful scholar' aspect clashes weakly with the 'obsession' without deeper exploration or nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a predictable trajectory for the genre (lone dissenter vs. system); lacks narrative surprise or complexity within the constraints.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>While elements are technically integrated, the overall piece feels more like a competent exercise fulfilling constraints than a unique, publishable story.</comment>
