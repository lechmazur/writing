<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Tiber's core conflict (prejudice vs. profession) is clear, but the rapid transformation strains credulity for a 'deep-seated' prejudice; Elara functions primarily as an expositional catalyst rather than a fully realized character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Efficient structure and pacing create a complete arc within the word limit, but the central encounter feels somewhat convenient as the sole trigger for resolving the core conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is generally well-evoked through contrasting settings (gala, market, recalled spaceport), but relies on some clich√©d descriptions ("forgotten constellations," "wind chimes") and the intended 'ancient novelty' tone feels inconsistently applied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong thematic exploration (prejudice, connection, letting go) and effective use of symbolism (punch, decay), but the character's epiphanies are stated too explicitly ("He understood then..."), reducing subtextual depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>While the premise (cuddler vs. Skyfarers) has potential, the plot resolution follows a predictable 'epiphany via wise stranger' trope, and the prose, while competent, lacks a truly unique authorial voice; the phrase "unusually usual" feels self-conscious and slightly jarring.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Successfully integrates most assigned elements into a focused narrative, but the central character transformation lacks sufficient psychological grounding, slightly undermining the overall believability and impact despite its thematic clarity.</comment>
