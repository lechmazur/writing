<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and consistent (coaxing life), and actions align. However, the 'theoretically rebellious' attribute feels somewhat abstract and less concretely demonstrated compared to other aspects; it's stated more than shown through specific rebellious acts beyond general persistence against decay.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent with a clear arc (problem, method, insight, action, initial result) effectively executed within the word limit. The 'translate' action drives the narrative logically, and the pacing feels well-managed, achieving a sense of completeness despite the brevity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting (ghostly orchard, comet) and timeframe ('throughout moving') create a strong, unified atmosphere that enhances the 'deliberate wilderness' tone and Tiber's motivation. The object (album) is meaningfully tied to the setting's past. Sensory details effectively establish the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance regarding remembrance and unconventional cultivation. Effective use of symbolism (album, weathervane, blossom). The writing style is evocative, though occasionally risks becoming slightly overwrought ("deliberate wilderness of a ritual"). The central conflict (man vs. decay/forgetting) is clear and the ending purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The core concept (translating intentions via weathervane/flowers) is highly original. While the prose is generally strong, some phrasing feels slightly self-consciously literary ("curator of endings," "composing with it"). It avoids major clich√©s and demonstrates a unique perspective, but lacks the absolute effortlessness of truly top-tier prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its disparate elements into a cohesive and evocative whole. The elements feel purposeful, serving the narrative rather than constraining it. The brief length works as a focused vignette, leaving a lingering sense of quiet persistence and melancholic hope.</comment>
