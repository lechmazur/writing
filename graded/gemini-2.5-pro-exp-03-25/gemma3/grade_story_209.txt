<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The core motivation (grief avoidance manifesting as mapping) is clear by the end, but the 'seasoned woodsman' and 'artfully messy' attributes feel superficial, mentioned rather than deeply integrated into his actions or worldview within the narrative. His voice is functional but lacks exceptional distinction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a complete arc within the word limit, but the central mechanism (short-circuit causing sudden, profound epiphany) feels narratively convenient and lacks psychological subtlety. The echo-mapping premise is thin, serving symbolism more than plausibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The Radio Wave Garden setting is evocative and symbolically potent. However, the assigned tone ('despairing cheer') is poorly executed; it's stated once but the prevailing atmosphere is one of somber isolation, making the initial description feel discordant and unsupported.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism effectively (Garden, hairbrush, railways), but the central epiphany relies too heavily on telling ("a wave of clarity washed over him," "Tiber finally understood") rather than showing the internal process more gradually or subtly. The theme is clear but delivered with insufficient nuance for top-tier literary fiction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>While avoiding overt clich√©s, the neat coincidence of the final beep, the equipment failure, and the moment of clarity feels overly constructed and formulaic, lacking the organic messiness of profound realization. The prose is competent but doesn't establish a truly unique or memorable style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The story integrates most elements adequately, but some feel less essential (woodsman, messy, cheer), suggesting the story is built around the constraints rather than using them seamlessly. It functions as a complete narrative but lacks the depth, subtlety, and stylistic distinction required for the highest echelon of publication.</comment>
