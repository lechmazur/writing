<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Tiber's core motivation (envy evolving to understanding) is clear, but the initial "confident" attribute feels underdeveloped, and the "forcibly gentle" trait is stated rather than convincingly demonstrated through action. The decades-long envy resolves somewhat rapidly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot arc is complete within the word count, but the core method (analyzing fingerprints on pollen dust) strains credulity significantly, weakening coherence. The Queen's convenient, positive reaction feels like an overly neat resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The beehive setting is functional, and the ruler adds texture, but the "coloring sessions" lack grounding detail. The atmosphere shifts appropriately, but sensory immersion could be stronger to fully realize the unique setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story achieves some emotional resonance and thematic depth regarding hidden desires within a collective. However, the initial "jubilant remorse" is an awkward, slightly confusing tonal choice that isn't fully earned or explored. Symbolism is present but not deeply impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The core concept is highly original, avoiding common tropes. However, the language occasionally dips into slightly mannered phrasing ("jubilant remorse"). While avoiding obvious AI tells, the premise's execution requires considerable suspension of disbelief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements are integrated, but the implausibility of the central method (fingerprints) creates a significant hurdle. The story demonstrates creativity but feels slightly underdeveloped, particularly in justifying the premise and the swiftness of the resolution. It doesn't quite reach the flawless standard required.</comment>
