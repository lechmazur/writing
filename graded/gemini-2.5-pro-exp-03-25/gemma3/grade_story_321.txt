<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Tiber's shift from radical apathy to empathy feels abrupt given his centuries-long history; Lyra's motivation is clear, but her character lacks deeper nuance beyond her goal. The attribute "almost radical" is imprecise and weakens the description of Tiber's apathy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible within the word count, but the resolution hinges on Tiber's convenient passivity. The "dream logic" concept feels slightly underdeveloped as a mechanism for the core action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The "infernal kitchen" setting provides good atmosphere, contrasting effectively with Lyra's delicate action. However, the connection between the setting and the "partial spool of ribbon" feels tenuous and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism (hourglass) effectively and establishes a clear conflict. However, the emotional impact relies more on the premise than deep character exploration, and the theme of reshaping memory, while present, isn't explored with significant depth or originality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While avoiding obvious clich√©s and AI tells, the piece lacks a truly distinctive voice. Concepts like "cosmic silence" and "dream logic" feel somewhat generic within the fantasy/afterlife genre, and the narrative unfolds predictably without surprising twists or deep subversions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story competently integrates most elements, but some (like the ribbon) feel less essential. It achieves cohesion but feels slightly constrained by the need to include specific prompts rather than flowing entirely organically. It's a solid execution but doesn't quite reach exceptional.</comment>
