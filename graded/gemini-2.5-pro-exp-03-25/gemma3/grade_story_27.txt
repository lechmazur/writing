<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Tiber's motivation (provoking evolution) feels slightly abstract and intellectualized compared to the visceral action of petrification. The "truth-telling curse" attribute is stated but minimally demonstrated, weakening its impact on his actions or dialogue beyond a single blunt statement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot structure is clear and effectively driven by the central action (petrification) and method (lunar sketching). It achieves a sense of completeness within the word limit, though Arthur's arrival feels slightly convenient rather than organically driven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The decaying amusement park setting is vividly evoked and strongly supports the "layered tranquility" tone and the magical realism elements. The prize booth location connects well with the vintage pencil box object, enhancing atmospheric coherence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (petrification as intellectual inflexibility) and establishes a clear theme regarding fate and resistance to change. The craft is solid, particularly in showing the gradual petrification rather than merely stating it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the core concept has originality, the execution leans slightly on familiar tropes (cursed truth-teller, magical object). The language avoids obvious AI pitfalls but lacks a truly distinctive authorial voice or exceptionally fresh metaphors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative, feeling deliberate rather than forced. The brevity works, creating a focused vignette with a lingering sense of eerie finality.</comment>
