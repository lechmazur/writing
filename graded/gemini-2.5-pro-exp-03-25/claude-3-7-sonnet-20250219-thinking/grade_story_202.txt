<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The character's motivation (vigilante justice) is clear, but the "innocently guilty" attribute feels asserted rather than demonstrated, lacking psychological depth. The "code of instinct" is mentioned for authentication but doesn't convincingly translate to her poisoning methodology or moral framework.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a complete arc within the word limit. The scavenger hunt method is logical for the setting and target. However, the overall structure relies on a fairly conventional vigilante execution plot without significant twists.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The museum setting is well-utilized and connected to the object and action. However, the skateboarding timeframe feels like superficial background noise, offering convenient cover but little atmospheric integration. The "dusty starlight" tone is mentioned fleetingly, not sustained throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story presents a clear conflict and uses some effective imagery (comparing authentication and clue design). However, it lacks significant subtext or emotional resonance beyond the surface narrative of methodical revenge. The ending fulfills the setup but offers little surprise or deeper reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Relies heavily on the "skilled assassin/vigilante with a code" trope. The parallel drawn between Mira's defiance and the skateboarders feels explicitly stated and somewhat forced, lacking originality. Language is functional but rarely rises to a distinctive or memorable style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>While core elements (poisoner, rapier, museum, scavenger hunt) are well-integrated, others (skateboarding, specific motivation, tone) feel tacked on rather than organically woven. The story is competent but doesn't transcend its components to achieve exceptional cohesion or impact.</comment>
