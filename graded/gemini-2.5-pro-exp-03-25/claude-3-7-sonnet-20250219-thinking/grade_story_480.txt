<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The core concept of 'social media exorcist' is strong and defines the character's role, but the assigned motivation ('curiosity') feels stated rather than demonstrated. The attribute 'quietly loud' is mentioned but has little bearing on her actions or portrayal within the scene. Her method ('infiltrating clubs') is background info, not actively used here.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The plot follows a simple, coherent structure (summons -> task -> completion) within the word limit. However, the assigned action ('reignite') serves only as stated motivation, not a demonstrated plot point or character change. The assigned method ('infiltrating secret clubs') is irrelevant to the events shown. The 'familiar strangers' concept feels tacked on and doesn't influence the plot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The setting ('abandoned mess hall') and timeframe ('after the final chord') work effectively together to create a strong, specific, and eerie atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like the blue screen light. The client's 'indifferent enthusiasm' adds an unsettling tonal layer. The connection between the object (receipt) and the immediate setting feels purely functional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story's central concept is original and thought-provoking ('digital demons'). It establishes a clear conflict and uses the 'exorcist' metaphor effectively. However, the execution relies more on telling than showing, particularly regarding the character's motivation and the impact of the exorcism. The ending feels abrupt, more of a setup than a resonant conclusion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The core premise offers significant originality, avoiding common tropes by applying the exorcism framework to social media. The writing avoids obvious AI tells like excessive formality or purple prose. However, some descriptions verge on generic ('methodical precision'), and emotional depth is limited, relying on stated feelings or predictable reactions rather than nuanced portrayal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves basic cohesion, but several assigned elements (familiar strangers, infiltrating clubs, quietly loud) feel superficially integrated rather than essential components driving the narrative. The core concept is creative, but the execution within the tight constraints doesn't fully capitalize on its potential, leaving it feeling slightly underdeveloped for top-tier publication.</comment>
