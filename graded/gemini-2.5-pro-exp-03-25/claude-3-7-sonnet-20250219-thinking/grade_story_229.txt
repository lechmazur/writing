<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The character trait "mildly curious" clashes significantly with the thirty-year obsession required to develop the technology and pursue the goal, creating a motivational inconsistency that undermines believability at a high literary level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is commendably tight and achieves a clear arc within the word limit, effectively using the action and method. However, the core mechanism requires substantial suspension of disbelief without deeper grounding, bordering on convenient magic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The setting and atmosphere are strong points, with the ship graveyard effectively enhancing the themes of memory, decay, and resonance. Sensory details are present but could be slightly more unique or evocative to reach the highest standard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully evokes emotion and uses symbolism (water, rain, box) effectively. The ending provides closure, but Eliza's final lines lean towards explaining the premise rather than purely character-driven dialogue, slightly weakening the impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>While possessing originality in its core concept, some phrasing ("skeletal remains," "fabric of existence," "temporal resonance") feels slightly familiar or leans towards abstract jargon. Emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than purely shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates skill in weaving the assigned elements into a cohesive and emotionally resonant narrative. The concept is intriguing, and the brief form feels appropriate, though minor inconsistencies (character trait) prevent perfection.</comment>
