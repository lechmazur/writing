<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Miriam's 'apothecary' background feels disconnected from her actions, which are purely biological observation/tracking. Her motivation (tracking butterflies) is clear, but the 'wayward' aspect isn't explored. The 'unconventional love' with Laurent is asserted rather than demonstrated, lacking depth and impact on their actions or dialogue beyond brief mentions. Laurent is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically from observation to discovery within the word limit. The action 'infect' directly enables the tracking, and the 'morse code' method becomes a pivotal reveal. A clear mini-arc exists. However, the final discovery feels somewhat convenient, relying heavily on the sudden revelation of butterfly morse code mirroring human transmissions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting and the 'between broken treaties' timeframe create a strong, cohesive atmosphere of isolated scientific pursuit amidst global chaos. The observation deck is used effectively. Sensory details (hissing steam, whirring mechanics, glowing light) enhance immersion. The 'battered marvel' tone aligns well with the description of the resilient butterflies.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story successfully evokes wonder through strong imagery (underwater ballet, glowing swarm). The central concept is unique. There's subtext regarding nature's resilience and communication versus human conflict. The ending provides a sense of discovery. However, the dialogue is merely functional, and the emotional core (the relationship) lacks convincing portrayal ('showing' vs 'telling' issue).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The core concept (steampunk naturalist tracking underwater butterflies) is highly original. However, the execution includes some familiar tropes (outcasts finding love amidst chaos) and slightly standard phrasing ("pressed her nose," "transcendent beauty"). The butterfly morse code reveal, while surprising, borders on anthropomorphic convenience rather than truly alien intelligence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story integrates most elements effectively, particularly the setting, action, method, and motivation. The 'apothecary' and 'unconventional love' elements feel less integral. The brief length works for this snapshot of discovery. The combination of steampunk, biology, and wartime backdrop is creative, leaving a lingering sense of wonder despite minor weaknesses.</comment>
