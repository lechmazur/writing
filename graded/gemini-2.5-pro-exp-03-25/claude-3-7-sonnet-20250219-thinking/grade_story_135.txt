<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and drives the plot, but the 'brewer' attribute feels superficial and disconnected from the core linguistic mission. Character lacks deep internal exploration beyond stated doubt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, but the method (deciphering bruises on a poster via 'peculiar faith') feels overly convenient and weakens the cause-and-effect chain's plausibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Evocative setting and atmosphere, but the 'after the invention of the wheel' timeframe feels vague and poorly integrated with the specific post-migration/frozen harbor context.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story achieves thematic resonance regarding preservation and memory, but the final realization is stated too explicitly rather than fully shown. Craft is competent but lacks exceptional literary flair.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The core concept and setting offer originality, but the reliance on a convenient plot device (poster) and the underdeveloped 'brewer' aspect detract. Avoids obvious AI pitfalls but lacks a truly distinctive voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Most elements are integrated cohesively, creating a unique scenario. However, the story's overall strength is diminished by the weaker integration of certain elements (brewer, timeframe) and the convenient plot resolution.</comment>
