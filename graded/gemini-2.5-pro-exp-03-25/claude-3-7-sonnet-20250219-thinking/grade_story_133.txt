<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivation feels slightly bifurcated (throne vs. hunting methods) and the shift from 15 years of denial to action after one encounter seems abrupt; the 'jaded' aspect is asserted rather than deeply shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, using the pottery class effectively as a catalyst, but the protagonist's rapid change of heart after years of hiding strains credulity slightly, feeling convenient for the length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The unique setting (rooftop orchard map) is highly evocative and well-integrated, strongly enhancing the atmosphere of secrecy and heritage, though the 'colonial' aspect feels less developed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (gloves, lock metaphor) and establishes clear conflict/theme, but relies heavily on the familiar hidden heir trope; the ending is purposeful but lacks deeper immediate emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While avoiding obvious clich√©s, some phrasing ("delightfully menacing," "demure audacity") feels slightly mannered, and the core plot lacks significant originality. The prose is competent but doesn't yet achieve a truly distinctive voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story integrates most elements cohesively, particularly the setting and symbolism, but the rapid character shift and slightly underdeveloped motivation prevent it from feeling entirely seamless or deeply resonant.</comment>
