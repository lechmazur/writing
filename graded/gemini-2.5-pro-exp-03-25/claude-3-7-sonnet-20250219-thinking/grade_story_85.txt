<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear, but Kai remains somewhat archetypal (the quiet seeker); his internal transformation is described rather than deeply, uniquely evoked.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, but the central revelation feels slightly convenient ("in an eyeblink"), lacking sufficient build-up or struggle for top-tier impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The petrified forest setting is evocative and thematically resonant, strongly supporting the mood, though it relies heavily on the inherent symbolism rather than forging truly unique sensory details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Uses symbolism effectively, but the prose occasionally becomes overwrought ("mineral permanence," "jubilation bloomed"), and key themes are stated too explicitly, reducing impactful subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While avoiding obvious AI tells, the narrative follows a familiar wisdom-quest template, and the prose lacks a truly distinctive voice, using some generic phrasing ("burden of knowledge").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements are integrated cohesively, but the story's overall impact is muted by its archetypal feel and prose that doesn't quite reach the level of exceptional originality or depth.</comment>
