<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The 'fiercely apathetic' attribute is stated clearly but the transition away from it, sparked by the resignation, feels somewhat abrupt and convenient rather than a deeply earned psychological shift. The 'tired swordsman' aspect feels more like descriptive flavour than a fundamental shaper of action or perspective within this specific scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent with a clear arc (stasis -> catalyst -> decision) within the word limit. However, the inciting incident (Tomas's resignation) leading directly to overcoming decades of apathy feels slightly formulaic and lacks nuanced development. Pacing is adequate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The floating monastery setting effectively establishes isolation and contrasts with the eventual desire for escape. The atmosphere supports the character's internal state. However, sensory details could be more specific and evocative to fully immerse the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story uses clear symbolism (meteors, broken seal, bag) and presents a discernible theme of overcoming self-imposed limits. However, the emotional impact is moderate, relying on somewhat familiar beats of resignation giving way to hope. It shows more than tells, but lacks profound subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>While avoiding egregious AI tells, the narrative relies on common tropes (stoic character's sudden change of heart, symbolic object holding past promise). Phrases like "comfortable numbness of surrender" or "spark of defiance" are functional but lack striking originality. The emotional arc feels predictable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The assigned elements are integrated competently, serving the narrative arc. The story feels cohesive for its length. However, it doesn't quite transcend the sum of its parts to offer a truly memorable or unique literary experience demanded at the highest level.</comment>
