<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The puppeteer background provides a neat metaphor but feels like a conveniently transplanted skill set for deciphering ancient temple secrets; her immediate, profound understanding lacks sufficient grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Relies on the protagonist's overly rapid, almost preternatural insights, and the initial "puzzle event" setup feels underdeveloped as a plot catalyst for her specific discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Temple atmosphere is well-evoked ("marble silence"), but the "puzzle event" creates a slight, unexplained dissonance with the ancient setting, weakening overall immersion and feeling like a tacked-on entry point.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical framework (puppetry, musical rests) but marred by repetition of the "symphonies of truth" concept and a somewhat too-neat, swift resolution without deeper emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The core puzzle (stamps/gown-tears) is highly original, but the protagonist's hyper-efficient deduction process and the somewhat standard "ancient secret" frame lessen its overall freshness and depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Imaginative core concept and evocative language are hampered by narrative conveniences (skill transfer, speed of insight) and a lack of deeper character struggle, falling short of flawless execution.</comment>
