<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's "lukewarm" state is well-linked to motivation, but the crucial transition driven by fear is stated more than viscerally shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Achieves a clear internal arc, but the pivotal "clash" action is largely observational, rendering the protagonist somewhat passive at a key moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Subverts the "mage's regret" trope with the "lukewarm" concept, but some expository phrasing (e.g., "the Burning") feels conventional rather than uniquely stylised.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements integrate with impressive cohesion, though the resolution from deep trauma to hopeful creation feels somewhat accelerated for truly profound impact within this brief scope.</comment>
