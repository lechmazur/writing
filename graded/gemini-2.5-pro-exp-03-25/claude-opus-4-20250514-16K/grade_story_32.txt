<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The "grim sentinel" attribute shapes a consistent, determined character, though the internal texture of "grim" beyond steadfast resolve could be more uniquely explored for peak literary depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is commendably tight and coherent, with the "build" action effectively driving a complete arc; the 17-year duration, while functional, lacks deeper resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Excellent use of symbolism (coin, pamphlet) and evocative language ("singed with forgetting," "ladder of sound") creates significant thematic depth and emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The core conceit of the coin-song memory mechanism is highly original, executed with fresh, non-formulaic prose and avoiding typical AI-associated shortcomings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The assigned elements are interwoven with impressive cohesion, resulting in a resonant and complete narrative that feels deliberate and thoughtfully constructed within its brevity.</comment>
