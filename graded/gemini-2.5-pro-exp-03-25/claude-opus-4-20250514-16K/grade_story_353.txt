<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The "cynically gentle" attribute is promising but feels more asserted than deeply explored; the shadows' vocal guidance externalizes too much of Martha's internal process and crucial decision-making for her revolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The plot hinges on the abrupt introduction of a time machine and overly convenient, complex temporal mechanics for the contagion ("exactly fourteen days...timed to bloom...during tomorrow's new moon"), straining coherence and feeling engineered rather than organic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the bakery setting and initial mystical elements are evocative, the "emergency time machine garage" introduces a jarring science-fiction element that feels tonally incongruous and insufficiently integrated with the established folkloric atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Strong central metaphors (e.g., "yeast of justice") and a unique premise are significant strengths, but these are undercut by a reliance on convenient narrative devices like the vocal, guiding shadows and overly precise magic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The core baker-revolutionary concept is commendably fresh and original; however, the execution leans on some un-subverted tropes (the conveniently forgotten powerful artifact) and the shadow interactions lack a truly distinct or surprising voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story's ambitious and imaginative core is a clear strength, but it's significantly hampered by insufficiently integrated key elements (the time machine, the overly precise magical timings) that prevent it from achieving true cohesion and flawlessness.</comment>
