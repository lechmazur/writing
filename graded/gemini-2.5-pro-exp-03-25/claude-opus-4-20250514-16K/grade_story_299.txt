<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The 'unsure champion' attribute feels more stated than deeply explored, lacking sufficient impact on her observable actions within the narrative's present; her rational resolve overshadows the alleged uncertainty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>A key plot point—convincing the elders—is resolved through summary ("she'd argued rationally") rather than dramatized action, diminishing narrative tension and the impact of her 'rebellion'.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strength: The setting is exceptionally well-realized, with sensory details and atmosphere intrinsically linked to and amplifying the story's core conflict (erosion) and themes (imperfect preservation).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Strength: Rich thematic depth and potent symbolism (especially the amber brooch). Weakness: The crucial persuasion scene integral to the character's 'rational rebellion' is told rather than shown, lessening its dramatic impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Weakness: Some key thematic phrases ("via interconnected paths," "cheerful gloom") feel somewhat directly inserted. Strength: The central metaphor of the insect in amber is highly original and thematically resonant, elevating the concept of preservation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strength: Impressive thematic cohesion and skillful integration of disparate elements. Weakness: The narrative expediency in resolving the central conflict with the elders prevents the story from achieving its full dramatic potential and depth for this market.</comment>
