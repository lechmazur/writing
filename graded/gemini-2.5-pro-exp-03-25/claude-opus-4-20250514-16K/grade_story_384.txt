<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Maria's 'cook' identity is central and well-utilized for the discovery, but the 'frantic' aspect is brief and her grander motivation ("to expose the root of all illusions") feels retrospectively applied rather than innate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot hinges effectively on the discovery, but the rapid, almost unquestioning acceptance of Maria's revolutionary theory by established scientists strains credulity, even for a fantastical premise, weakening the plot's coherence at a critical juncture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of the ancient, dusty discovery with the modern facility is effective, and culinary sensory details are strong, though the titular 'frenzied tranquility' is more stated than consistently evoked throughout the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The core metaphor of 'earth as kitchen' is highly original and impactful, offering rich subtext, but the narrative resolution (scientists' quick acceptance) feels overly simplistic, blunting the dramatic potential of the 'subversion.'"</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Exceptional originality in its central conceit (culinary seismology), but the story leans on some un-subverted tropes, particularly the swift, almost facile conversion of skeptical authorities, which feels narratively convenient.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Inventively combines disparate elements into a memorable premise, yet the narrative expediency, especially in the scientific validation phase, sacrifices the depth and nuanced conflict resolution expected at the highest literary level.</comment>
