<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara serves her symbolic role effectively, but lacks deeper psychological nuance beyond her defining rebelliousness. The mask's shifting expressions are stated rather than fully integrated into a complex inner life.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear, but the revolution's ignition and the convenient appearance of other rebels feel somewhat abrupt for a truly rigorous plot. The giant is an underdeveloped, late-appearing threat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The "giant's bookshelf" is a striking image, yet the nature of the "giant" and the mechanics of its library (e.g., the "invisible" crack) verge on whimsical convenience rather than deeply considered world-building.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While thematically resonant, the prose occasionally dips into expected metaphors ("metallic flower"). The emotional impact is clear but sometimes directly conveyed, rather than purely evoked through subtle craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The core concept is notably fresh. However, the execution, particularly the rapid, triumphant uprising, touches upon familiar narrative patterns, slightly diluting its unique potential. Some emotional descriptors are standard.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>A commendable effort with a strong central idea and vivid imagery, but it doesn't consistently maintain the exceptional level of refined execution required for the most discerning publications. Some elements feel more asserted than earned.</comment>
