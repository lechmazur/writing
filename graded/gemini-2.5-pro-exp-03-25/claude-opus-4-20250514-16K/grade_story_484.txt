<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "uniquely generic" attribute and "flippant solemnity" create a distinct voice and initial characterization. However, the pivotal motivation ("to become a living embodiment of his values") feels more like a sudden thematic assertion to serve the plot's climax rather than a deeply earned or subtly developed character trait throughout the narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is efficiently structured and coherent within its supernatural-activist premise, with the "initiate" action effectively launching the core conflict. The primary weakness lies in the resolution: the darkness being defeated by laughter, while thematically fitting, feels somewhat simplistic and convenient for a top-tier literary piece, lacking a more complex or viscerally impactful mechanism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The "haunted mansion graveyard" setting and the "lull in a protest" timeframe mesh well, and the "flippant solemnity" tone is skillfully maintained. Sensory details are present, but the "haunted" aspect remains somewhat superficial, serving more as a necessary backdrop than a deeply textured environment that significantly elevates the narrative beyond its functional role.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story's central metaphor (gentrification as literal darkness) is its strongest craft element, and the witty dialogue is engaging. However, the overall impact is slightly diminished by a resolution that, while thematically resonant (defiance, seeing truth), feels more allegorically neat than dramatically profound or surprising, limiting its claim to the highest literary echelon.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story avoids overt AI-like giveaways through its distinct voice and humorous touches. The originality stems from the unique *combination* of activist protest and supernatural horror. However, individual supernatural elements (mirror reflecting evil, darkness fearing light/truth) are familiar tropes, and the story doesn't entirely transcend a feeling of cleverly repurposed components rather than groundbreaking invention.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story is commendably cohesive, weaving its assigned elements into a clear and engaging narrative within the brief length. The central idea is creative. However, for an "immediate publishability in a competitive market" standard, the resolution's mechanism feels slightly facile, preventing the story from achieving the depth and unshakeable impact of truly flawless work.</comment>
