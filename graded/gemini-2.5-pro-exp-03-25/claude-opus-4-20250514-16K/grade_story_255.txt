<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The "analytically innovative" attribute is stated but insufficiently demonstrated in the story's climax, where the seer's gift, not analytical deduction, provides the crucial password, creating a disconnect with a key character trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the password's sudden mystical revelation, while fitting the "seer" element, somewhat lessens the narrative tension surrounding the "stubborn encryption" by side-stepping a more earned breakthrough.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned control tower and post-party hush create a potent, well-integrated atmosphere; the petrichor detail is a strong, unique sensory anchor for the seer's gift and the plot's turning point.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story achieves good thematic resonance and uses imagery effectively ("confetti like colorful ghosts"); however, the central conflict's resolution (password) relies more on telling the vision's content than showing an interplay of gift and intellect.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While some imagery is fresh (petrichor trigger), the password's specific, symbolic nature ("tail number...reversed and paired with the date justice was denied") feels like a convenient narrative trope rather than an organically derived secret, slightly undermining originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is generally cohesive and creatively combines most elements; however, the underutilization of the "analytically innovative" trait in the core puzzle-solving slightly weakens the overall synthesis of assigned components.</comment>
