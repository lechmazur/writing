<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maeve's "expectantly resigned" attribute and "ethereal grit" voice are well-portrayed; her grand motivation to "stride through boundaries" is clear, though its immediate enactment is more foundational (upholding) than direct transgression in this scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot coherently depicts the "uphold" action via "following star paths," achieving a satisfying micro-arc of ritual and reaffirmation within the word limit; pacing is well-managed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The "nectar collection facility" in the pre-mortal timeframe creates a powerfully evocative and fitting atmosphere for the "ethereal grit" tone and the "chorus of healing" concept; sensory details are strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exceptional use of imagery and symbolism ("cracks leaking light," dolls as diminished gods) creates significant thematic depth regarding healing and sacrifice, prompting reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The core premise is highly original; while the writing style is distinct and largely avoids clich√©, the "carnival" aspect of the cane, though intriguing, feels like a slightly less organically integrated element compared to the ancient/divine core.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable creative synthesis, weaving its assigned elements into a cohesive and resonant vignette that leaves a lingering sense of awe and profound purpose.</comment>
