<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Marcus's social awkwardness is well-portrayed and drives his initial choices, but the "inventor" aspect feels somewhat underdeveloped beyond his decoding skills; his grandmother's "hopefully cynical" attribute is too fleeting to significantly shape her character or impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear and satisfying arc within the word limit, with the grandmother's message serving as an effective turning point, though its directness slightly lessens the subtlety of Marcus's self-discovery. Pacing is well-managed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting (diner, late shift) and the concept of the encrypted archive are seamlessly integrated, creating a strong, consistent atmosphere that effectively supports Marcus's initial isolation and focused work, enhanced by specific sensory details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (whistle, archive) and metaphor to explore a clear theme of choosing life over stagnation, culminating in a purposeful ending. The dialogue, though minimal, is impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While the writing is clean and avoids major AI tells, the narrative relies on familiar tropes (e.g., message from deceased relative guiding protagonist, socially awkward tech type) without deeply subverting them, making the overall premise feel competent but not strikingly original.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The assigned elements are generally well-integrated to serve a cohesive narrative and thematic purpose, with the story achieving a sense of completeness and delivering a clear emotional shift for the protagonist within its brief scope.</comment>
