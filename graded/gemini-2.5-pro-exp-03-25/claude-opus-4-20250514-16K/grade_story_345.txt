<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The transition from a 20-year dogmatic past to "unapologetically confused" feels rapid; the psychological depth of such a profound shift is asserted rather than deeply explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot relies on a convenient mystical device ("future self's footprints") for resolution, making the character's pivotal insight feel less earned; more symbolic journey than compelling narrative progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "giant bean stalks to heaven" imagery, while striking, teeters on juvenile fantasy, potentially jarring with the serious themes; the atmosphere is strong, but the world occasionally feels more symbolic than organically realized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Constant, dense barrage of overt metaphors (snow as scriptures, shadows as cathedral, etc.) creates a self-consciously "literary" and somewhat heavy-handed feel, sacrificing subtlety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Prose frequently leans towards the ornate and overly elaborate ("purple"), and emotions are often declared; the style feels more performatively crafted than conveying an authentic, nuanced voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Ambitious thematic elements are present, but the story's impact is diminished by consistently overwrought prose and a character epiphany that feels somewhat rushed and unearned for its magnitude.</comment>
