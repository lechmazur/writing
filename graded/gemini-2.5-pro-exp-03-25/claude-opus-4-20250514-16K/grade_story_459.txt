<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marcus's core trait of seeing ghosts is central and drives his actions. However, the "elegantly clumsy" attribute feels somewhat ornamental, mentioned but not deeply integrated into his key decisions or the narrative's core. His motivation evolves believably from observation to understanding, culminating in letting go, though the stated "liberation" is more a discovery than an initial driving force.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is effective, with a clear beginning, rising action (investigation, dissection of patterns), climax (flower crown), and resolution. The action "dissect" meaningfully propels the middle section. The narrative achieves a satisfying sense of completeness and coherence within the word limit, with logical cause and effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The "sand castle preservation lab" is a highly original and evocative setting, intrinsically linked to the unique nature of the ghosts. Sensory details, particularly the "faint perfume of roses and sea salt," are used effectively. The atmosphere supports Marcus's quiet introspection and the story's melancholic, reflective tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story succeeds in evoking an emotional response and prompting reflection on memory and acceptance. The central symbolism of sand castles as trapped memories is powerful and original. The ending is purposeful and resonant. The "show, don't tell" principle is generally well applied, especially in depicting Marcus's internal shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The core premise (ghosts from memories in sand) is highly original, subverting common tropes. The writing style is mostly clear and avoids excessive flourishes, though phrases like "elegance only the genuinely clumsy possess" lean slightly towards affectation. Overall, it demonstrates a unique authorial voice and avoids predictable patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive, with most assigned elements serving the narrative well, particularly the setting and the object. The unique premise is creatively explored, and the brief length feels appropriate for the focused emotional arc, leaving a lingering sense of poignant understanding.</comment>
