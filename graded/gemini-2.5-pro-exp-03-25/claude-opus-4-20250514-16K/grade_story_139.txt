<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Motivation is conventional; the "stubborn" attribute lacks deep integration into current actions or unique voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed with a satisfying reveal mechanism; coherence and pacing are strong for the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Setting supports the narrative, but sensory details lack consistent exceptional vividness; explicitly stated tone ("cautious enchantment") is less impactful than purely evoked atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Central mystery device (flute code) is clever and memorable, but instances of slightly clunky or overwritten prose detract from overall literary polish.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the central reveal method shows originality, the story employs a familiar core trope (doppelg√§nger) and the prose, while competent, lacks a consistently striking or unique authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated around an inventive premise, but for highest-tier publication, the prose requires further refinement and a more decisive push beyond some conventional narrative structures.</comment>
