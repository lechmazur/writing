<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strength: "Vigilant orchardist" trait is well-integrated into Marcus's investigative method and worldview. Weakness: "Sardonic glee" is more stated than deeply embodied in a unique character voice; the "never tardy" attribute feels more functional for plot than a profound character revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strength: Exceptionally tight plot with a complete arc, driven by the clever peacock code discovery and a resonant twist regarding the daughter's warning. Weakness: The broader mechanics of the conspiracy itself remain somewhat sketched, relying on the strength of Marcus's personal investigation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strength: The "paper airplane test facility" offers an ironic counterpoint to the deadly conspiracy, and the "sardonic glee" tone works with this. Weakness: Setting details like "sterile corridors" are somewhat generic, and the facility itself lacks truly distinctive or deeply unsettling atmospheric elements beyond Marcus's internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strength: Consistent and potent orchard-themed imagery ("blight," "harvest," "pruned") and the powerful symbolism of the peacock seal. Weakness: The concluding "tree of his life" metaphor, while thematically fitting, verges on conventional sentimentality, slightly dulling the narrative's otherwise sharp edge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strength: The central mechanism of the peacock seal—serving as both the conspirators' arrogant mark and the daughter's desperate warning—is highly original and impactful. Weakness: While the execution is fresh, the underlying "grieving parent seeks justice" framework and some descriptive phrases ("suspicious aviation accident") are conventional.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strength: The story achieves remarkable cohesion, skillfully weaving its assigned elements into a tight, compelling, and emotionally resonant narrative. Weakness: Occasional reliance on stating emotions (like the full depth of "sardonic glee") over nuanced showing and a few conventional phrasings prevent it from achieving "flawless" status for the most demanding publications.</comment>
