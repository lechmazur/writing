<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's key attribute ("harshly compassionate") is more asserted than fully demonstrated in her process; aloofness is rationalized rather than vividly illustrated through interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Narrative offers a reflective snapshot; the primary "action" of easing suffering is recounted rather than enacted, resulting in minimal forward plot momentum within the story's present.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, integral setting and strong atmosphere are standout strengths; a slightly broader sensory palette beyond the dominant visual could deepen immersion further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Polished craft and impactful imagery create resonance; relies somewhat on internal exposition via letters for key motivations, slightly reducing the immediacy of "showing."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original core concept and distinct voice; some familiar thematic undertones (e.g., misunderstood artist) are present but are effectively refreshed by the unique execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A thematically rich, stylistically accomplished vignette; its meditative quality and internal focus are strengths but may lack the dynamic narrative drive sought by the most demanding venues.</comment>
