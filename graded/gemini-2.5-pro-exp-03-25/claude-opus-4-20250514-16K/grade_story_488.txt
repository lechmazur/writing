<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and drives her actions, but her characterization as a "solitary summoner" feels somewhat superficial; her internal development beyond ambition, particularly the "absorption" of selves, is asserted rather than deeply explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot establishes a clear arc and effectively uses the assigned action, but the central magical act—transforming the lighthouse—relies on a "hiccup" in reality, which feels more like a convenient assertion than a fully realized mechanism within the established quantum rules.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The quantum beach setting and the "hush before demolition" timeframe are exceptionally well-integrated, creating a vivid, liminal atmosphere that perfectly supports the story's themes and Mara's actions; "corroded rapture" is masterfully evoked.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story excels in its use of evocative imagery and symbolism, crafting a narrative rich with subtext about invention and permanence; however, the conceptual density occasionally risks overshadowing emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of quantum physics and mystical ambition, avoiding common tropes; yet, the final description of the invention's spark as "oddly authentic" is a somewhat self-conscious echo of an assigned element, slightly marring its organic feel.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable cohesion, weaving disparate elements into a thought-provoking narrative that lingers; the creative combination of assigned concepts is a significant strength, resulting in a distinct and memorable piece.</comment>
