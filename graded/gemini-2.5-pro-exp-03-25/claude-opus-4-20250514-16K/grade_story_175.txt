<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>While functional and possessing a distinct voice, Corvus leans into the 'wise liberator' archetype, lacking profound psychological originality despite the clever 'innocently mischievous' cover.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The inventive core mechanism (paint-chip map, birdcage projector) is undermined by a significant allegorical leap in connecting 'coordinates' to the specific, complex 'consciousness harvesting' revelation, weakening internal coherence for a top-tier standard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The 'mushroom village' setting is exceptionally vivid, its bioluminescence and fungal elements masterfully integrated to serve both the illusion and its deconstruction, powerfully embodying the story's atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative demonstrates strong literary craft through striking, original imagery ('moonlight like trapped songs,' 'map written in decay') and potent symbolism, creating a memorable impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Core originality in the revelatory mechanism (decaying sign, birdcage projector) compellingly freshens a familiar 'liberation' narrative structure; the prose avoids genericism with purposeful, often elegant phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a remarkable cohesion, creatively interweaving its assigned elements into a resonant allegory that lingers beyond its concise telling, though not entirely flawless for the highest publication tier.</comment>
