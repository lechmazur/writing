<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The 'tactically reckless' attribute feels more like a label justifying the self-sacrificial climax than a consistently demonstrated trait influencing her investigative methods; 'parched' is a briefly mentioned detail.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot coheres around a novel discovery method, but the protagonist's shift to 'razing' (even as annotation) feels like an escalation not fully prepared for, and the critical reveal of other rangers' fates is somewhat convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The central premise is strikingly original, though the narrative relies on a 'doomed investigator' framework; prose is largely fresh, avoiding overt AI-like genericism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>A highly inventive scenario and strong atmospheric writing are commendable, but some character motivations and plot developments feel more intellectually constructed than organically character-driven.</comment>
