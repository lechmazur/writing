<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, but the "theoretically rebellious" attribute feels somewhat underdeveloped beyond her initial defiance; character lacks deeper psychological nuance for top-tier literary fiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a coherent arc within the word limit, but the climactic weathervane event (pointing straight up) leans towards a convenient plot device rather than a wholly organic or inevitable discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting ("ghostly orchard," "burning comet") and resulting atmosphere are vividly realized and constitute a significant strength, deeply enhancing the narrative's mood and the character's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism and evocative imagery, but thematic statements ("mindful choice," "deliberate") are somewhat overt and repeated, slightly diminishing the potential for more sophisticated subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The central method (weathervane guiding botany) offers strong originality, though some broader narrative elements (e.g., lone hermit, seeds of ancient wisdom) touch on recognizable tropes, albeit freshly presented.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The assigned elements are commendably integrated into a cohesive and creative narrative, but minor issues in character depth, plot convenience, and thematic subtlety prevent it from reaching flawless, immediately publishable status.</comment>
