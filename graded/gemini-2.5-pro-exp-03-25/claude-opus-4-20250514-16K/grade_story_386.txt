<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marya's motivation is poignantly established and central; however, the keeper's "trustworthy strange faith" functions more as a convenient plot enabler than a deeply explored character trait, slightly flattening his potential impact and simplifying Marya's path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a satisfying arc within its brevity. However, the struggle against the "universe's resistance" is described briefly rather than shown through its toll on Marya or the environment, making her profound act feel slightly less hard-won than its cosmic scale implies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The core imagery of an atom-powered lighthouse at a temporal boundary is highly original and evocative, creating a strong atmosphere. The unsettling or uncanny potential of this unique boundary, however, remains somewhat underdeveloped sensorily beyond its conceptual intrigue.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Powerful symbolism (tablecloth, memory-lights) and a thematically resonant ending are key strengths. However, crucial internal states like "unstoppable will" and the keeper's pivotal understanding are occasionally told directly rather than fully shown through action, dialogue, or subtler inference.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative skillfully blends speculative fiction with mystical elements into a refreshingly original concept, featuring striking metaphors ("stitch a constellation"). It largely subverts the "last of her kind" trope through its unique resolution, though the lyrical prose occasionally borders on the ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The story powerfully integrates its disparate elements into a cohesive and moving whole, achieving significant emotional impact for its constrained length. The central resolution, while poignant and imaginative, feels slightly too smooth and unhindered given the universe-altering scale of Marya's undertaking.</comment>
