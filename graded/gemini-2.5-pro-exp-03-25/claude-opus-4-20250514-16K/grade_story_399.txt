<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Mortimer's profound, decades-long grief is resolved with an unconvincing swiftness; the witch functions more as an expository mouthpiece for the theme than a complex character with truly organic motivations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear and complete arc within the constraints, but the central epiphany and resolution, while thematically appropriate, feel somewhat predictable and overly neat for a truly resonant impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The mystical atmosphere is effectively established and generally supports the narrative, though reliance on conventional tropes for such settings (obsidian skylight, crystals) slightly dulls its uniqueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story's primary weakness lies in its didacticism; core themes are explicitly articulated by the witch, leaving little room for reader interpretation and diminishing the power of subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a familiar "guided healing" archetype without significant subversion or fresh perspective, and the emotional resolution, while positive, unfolds along a somewhat predictable trajectory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>While the assigned elements are cohesively integrated, the story's overt thematic exposition and the conventionality of its central transformative arc prevent it from achieving standout literary merit.</comment>
