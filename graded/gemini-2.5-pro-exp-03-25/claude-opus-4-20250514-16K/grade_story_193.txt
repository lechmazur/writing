<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent but relies significantly on the convenience of "unseen forces" for initiation and a conventional inciting incident.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength with evocative sensory details, but the assigned "timeframe" (key turn) is poorly integrated as a continuous narrative state, functioning only as a brief, symbolic act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The narrative competently employs several common tropes (exiled royal, mystical guidance, storm encounter) without offering substantial subversion or memorable originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story maintains surface cohesion, but certain assigned elements, particularly the "unseen forces" and the "key turn timeframe," feel externally imposed rather than organically woven into the narrative fabric.</comment>
