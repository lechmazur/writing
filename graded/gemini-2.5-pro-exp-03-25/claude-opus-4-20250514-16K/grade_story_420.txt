<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sculptor's tactile perception is a strength; epiphany's comprehensive clarity arrives somewhat conveniently.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear catalytic event (light shift) effectively drives the compact plot; the initial "single note" feels less integral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric shift ("tomb" to "womb") and use of light; initial chamber description could offer more sensory depth before the epiphany.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (ring, fossil) and a resonant theme of transformation, though some thematic statements are a bit explicit for top-tier literary fiction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The core metaphorical connection (ring/bark/art) is fresh; the overall "epiphany solves block" structure is somewhat conventional.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements are skillfully interwoven into a cohesive, thematically resonant piece; the resolution, however, feels very tidy for the highest literary standard.</comment>
