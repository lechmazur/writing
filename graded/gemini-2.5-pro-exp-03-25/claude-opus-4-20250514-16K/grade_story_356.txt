<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mara's core motivation is clear and compelling, but the "wry" aspect of her "wry caretaker" persona is underdeveloped, and "warmly" in "warmly aloof" relies more on statement than active demonstration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a remarkable sense of completeness and a clear arc within the tight word limit, with the action logically driven by the concept; Vega's quick understanding is a minor convenience.</comment>
