<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Jian's profound character shift from ingrained arrogance happens too rapidly to be entirely convincing, even with his underlying guilt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot resolves too conveniently, with the sister's new path being handed down by the Master rather than more organically discovered or struggled for.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The narrative heavily relies on the common "arrogant protagonist humbled by wise sage" trope without offering significant subversion or true originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While emotionally coherent, the story's adherence to a familiar redemptive arc and somewhat predictable resolution prevents it from achieving distinctive literary merit.</comment>
