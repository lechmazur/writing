<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strength: Vera's actions are highly consistent with her described attributes ("methodically playful," "fierce determination") and core motivation. Weakness: The "ambassador" title feels somewhat broad or symbolic; her specific mandate or the entity she represents isn't explored, making her more archetypal than a deeply individualized character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strength: The plot is remarkably coherent and achieves a strong sense of completeness within the word limit, effectively driven by the central action of "indoctrination" and the pervasive concept of shared dreams.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strength: The "sunken zeppelin" setting and "between radio static" timeframe synergize to create a profoundly evocative and unique atmosphere that perfectly complements the story's themes of submerged consciousness and liminal reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strength: The story excels in its sophisticated use of potent symbolism (costume, origami birds) and rich, precise imagery, creating significant subtext about consciousness and reality that provokes deep reflection.</comment>
