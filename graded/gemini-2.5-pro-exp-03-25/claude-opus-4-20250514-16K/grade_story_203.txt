<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Marina's crucial shift from crippling, generationally-ingrained stage fright to "purposeful determination" and public defiance occurs too suddenly to be entirely convincing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc, but the resolution of a colony-wide, deeply ingrained superstition through a single act feels overly optimistic and swift for the established stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The orbital debris setting is evocative, but the specific nature of the colonists' fears ("demons in the darkness") feels somewhat generic rather than uniquely tied to the station's environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (toys, wildflowers), but the ending's "defiant hush," while poignant, implies a significant societal shift too readily, undercutting the depth of the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The central concept of an "exorcist-engineer" rebelling with toys is highly original; however, the initial "possession" leans on a familiar trope before its clever subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story creatively integrates its elements and presents a compelling theme, but the rapid resolution of complex psychological and societal issues feels somewhat unearned for the highest literary standard.</comment>
