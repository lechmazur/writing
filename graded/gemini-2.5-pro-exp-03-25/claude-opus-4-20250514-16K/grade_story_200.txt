<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Vera's "hesitant saboteur" trait is stated but feels underdeveloped in the face of her "savage serenity" and decisive actions during the climax; the internal conflict isn't fully exploited.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The critical logical leap—how previously "weakened" buildings become specific "points of regeneration" via the frequency generator—is insufficiently explained, undermining coherence despite a generally clear arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The "harmonic resonance chamber" is exceptionally well-utilized, with its acoustic properties intrinsically linked to plot mechanics and atmosphere, creating a vivid and functional setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story achieves strong thematic resonance with the powerful concept of transforming destruction into healing, yet the impact is slightly dulled by the plot's central mechanical ambiguity and minorly awkward phrasing like "functionally rare."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The core premise is highly original, avoiding most tropes with its unique blend of acoustics and subversive healing; however, the unexplained link in the healing mechanism feels like a narrative convenience rather than rigorously developed internal logic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates significant creative ambition and integrates its elements thematically, but the crucial unexplained mechanism for city-wide regeneration prevents it from achieving the flawless execution required for top-tier publication.</comment>
