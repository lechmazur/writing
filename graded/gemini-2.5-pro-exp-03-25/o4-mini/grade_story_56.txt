<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The 'bluffing swindler' aspect feels underdeveloped and somewhat contradictory to the core motivation without a clearer redemption arc shown. The 'energetically lethargic' trait is stated more than demonstrated, lacking deep integration into actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically from the inciting incident (computer restart) to the climax (data upload), achieving a reasonable arc within the word count. However, the meet-cute feels slightly contrived and slows the momentum momentarily.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The setting is highly evocative and original, strongly enhancing the atmosphere of decay and rebirth. Sensory details are present, though the assigned 'gentle harshness' tone feels applied superficially at the end rather than woven throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism (price tag, orchard) effectively and establishes a clear conflict/theme around truth and accountability. However, emotional depth relies occasionally on telling rather than showing, and some imagery borders on clich√© ("sunrise in ruins").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the setting is original, some phrasing feels overly ornate ("humming in gratitude," "triumphant roar"). The meet-cute and vague 'invisible allies' lean towards familiar tropes. Emotional nuance is present but sometimes stated directly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion despite numerous constraints, with the setting and core action integrating well. However, character elements and the 'invisible allies' feel less organically incorporated, slightly weakening the overall impact.</comment>
