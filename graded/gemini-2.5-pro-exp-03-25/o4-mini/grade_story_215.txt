<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The character feels underdeveloped. "Rattled exorcist" is stated but lacks depth; the "exorcist" aspect seems largely irrelevant to her actions. "Inwardly social" is mentioned but not convincingly demonstrated through nuanced behaviour. Motivation is clear but feels somewhat generic for the trope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot structure (puzzle sequence leading to discovery) is coherent and achieves a basic arc. However, the pacing feels rushed, particularly through the puzzle sequence, and the initiating context ("amid dance lessons") feels disconnected and arbitrary, weakening overall coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The setting ("psychic research facility") is functional but underdeveloped. The "amid dance lessons" timeframe feels jarringly incongruous and detracts from the atmosphere rather than enhancing it. Sensory details are present but not consistently evocative or immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story attempts thematic exploration (science vs. wonder, disclosure) but relies heavily on telling rather than showing. Literary devices are used, but not with exceptional skill or originality. The central conflict is clear but resolved predictably. Lacks significant emotional resonance or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>While the combination of elements is unusual, the execution feels somewhat formulaic. The prose contains clich√©s ("nimble fingers," "sharp breath") and stated emotions ("collar damp with fear"). The puzzle-solving trope isn't subverted. Feels competent but lacks a distinctive authorial voice or genuine originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story struggles to cohesively integrate its disparate assigned elements, particularly the "dance lessons" and "exorcist" background, making it feel more like an exercise in fulfilling constraints than an organic narrative. The elements often dictate the story rather than serving it.</comment>
