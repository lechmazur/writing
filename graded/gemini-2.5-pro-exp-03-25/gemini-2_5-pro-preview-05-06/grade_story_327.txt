<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Lyra's pivotal transformation from "restless" to "focused calm" feels more asserted than deeply earned within the narrative's scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot's inciting incident (road closure) is overly convenient, and the "haggle" action feels perfunctory, weakening structural integrity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The explicit repetition of assigned phrases like "complexly simple" feels somewhat inorganic, slightly marring an otherwise fresh central concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The core creative mechanism is inventive, but the overall execution reveals the seams of its construction from assigned elements too readily for top-tier publication.</comment>
