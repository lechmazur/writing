<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation (boredom) and key trait (intelligently foolish) are clear and drive actions. Deeper character nuance and a distinct voice are limited by brevity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot is a coherent, clever escalation achieving its arc. The swift, total collapse of power via the figurine, while efficient, borders on over-convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmospheric "harmonic caves" are integral to plot mechanics. The petrified council feels somewhat abstract as an antagonistic force until their overthrow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Core plot mechanism is highly original and ingenious. Narrative framework employs recognizable tropes (ancient bored entity) without substantial subversion, relying on execution for freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Exceptional cohesion in integrating elements into a complete narrative. Achieves high cleverness but lacks truly groundbreaking thematic depth or profound lingering impact.</comment>
