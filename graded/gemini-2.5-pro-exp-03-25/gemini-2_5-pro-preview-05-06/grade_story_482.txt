<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character attributes feel more like set dressing than deeply integrated drivers of nuanced behavior; motivation is standard for a protagonist facing a threat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot is largely static, relying on depiction of a continuous process rather than a developed arc with palpable stakes or progression; key action remains highly abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Primary setting is evocative, but the symbolic resonance and necessity of the specific vision-space ("empty classroom") feels underdeveloped and somewhat arbitrary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lyrical style occasionally undermines narrative directness with overly ornate phrasing; thematic applications can feel more asserted than organically discovered by the character or reader.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Relies on some familiar narrative patterns of introspection and explicitly stated emotions, and the prose occasionally feels self-consciously "literary" rather than authentically nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Integration of numerous elements is competent but occasionally feels strained, with the seams of the underlying prompts perceivable, hindering full narrative immersion.</comment>
