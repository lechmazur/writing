<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Awkwardness is more stated than consistently shown through varied action; "swordsman" aspect feels somewhat superficial. Motivation is clear but delivered too directly for top-tier subtlety.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a clear arc for its length; the unique "hermit crab" method is a creative strength, though the scroll's exact acquisition by Kaelen is a minor gloss-over.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting is highly evocative ("frigid tundra orchard," geothermal vents) with strong sensory detail; atmosphere and the "ephemeral rancor" tone are consistently well-integrated, enriching the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>A strikingly original central metaphor (hermit crabs for spiritual transfer) and consistent literary craft are major strengths; the story successfully evokes a poignant mood and explores its themes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Narrative demonstrates significant originality in its core concept and method, largely avoiding formulaic writing; language is ambitious and mostly purposeful, contributing to a distinct style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Achieves strong cohesion of assigned elements, with the creative "hermit crab" concept being a standout success; however, not all elements feel equally indispensable or deeply woven into the story's fabric (e.g., the 'swordsman' trait).</comment>
