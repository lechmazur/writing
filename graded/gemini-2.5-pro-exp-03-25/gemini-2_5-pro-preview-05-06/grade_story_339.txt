<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear, but character depth and the performer aspect's integration into his present process feel superficial; key internal states are often told rather than deeply shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Achieves a minimal internal arc, but the central "action" of organizing memories is vaguely depicted, lacking dynamism or concrete moments of significant internal revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of lake and construction creates a strong atmospheric concept, but the crucial adjective "prismatic" for the lake remains underdeveloped sensorially, limiting its full impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Features some evocative imagery (skeletal frames, seesaw) and a unique central method, yet leans too heavily on direct emotional exposition ("turmoil," "desperate need") rather than consistently showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The seesaw method offers a spark of originality, but the overall "tortured artist" framework is familiar, and some descriptive language ("relentless chorus") lacks fresh distinction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively assembled, but the narrative's reliance on stated emotion and underdeveloped key imagery (the prismatic lake) prevents it from achieving truly exceptional literary merit.</comment>
