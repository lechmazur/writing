<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The 'wreck-diver' facet feels less dynamically integrated into the character's immediate actions and internal processes within the gallery scene compared to the 'ghost whisperer' aspect, which is more central to his method of seeking courage.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot compellingly charts an internal realization; the "family tradition" (assigned as 'method') effectively serves as the primary antagonist/catalyst for rebellion, rather than a direct method employed by the character for his 'action' of arousing courage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptionally vivid sensory details and the symbolic resonance of the abandoned carnival setting create a deeply immersive and thematically rich atmosphere, perfectly supporting the character's internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Masterful use of sustained imagery, potent symbolism (especially the amber), and a consistently elevated literary style crafts a narrative with significant emotional depth and resonant subtext concerning freedom and self-discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The distinctive combination of character (wreck-diver ghost whisperer), setting (abandoned carnival), and object (amber) imbues a familiar theme of rebellion against tradition with considerable freshness and a nuanced, individual voice, avoiding formulaic pitfalls.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable cohesion, weaving its assigned elements into a poignant narrative that achieves significant emotional and thematic impact within its concise form, feeling deliberate and impactful rather than constrained.</comment>
