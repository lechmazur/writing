<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character's cynicism and arrogance are well-portrayed and drive her motivation; however, the "humbly" aspect of the assigned "humbly arrogant" attribute is underdeveloped, making the full character trait feel incompletely realized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is internally coherent but extremely minimal, functioning more as a static character moment. The "echo of a voice in a canyon" as the method of awakening presents a slight geographical implausibility for a lighthouse setting without more explicit justification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is exceptionally well-crafted and immersive, with strong sensory details. The phrase "borrowed century" is evocative but slightly imprecise, and the "canyon echo" remains a minor point of potential setting dissonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong literary craft and subtext; however, certain phrases ("reluctant sanctuary across the hush of a borrowed century," "fleeting auditory wisp") verge on being overly ornate, and the use of a cliché ("complex knot in the heart") slightly mars the overall impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>While offering a generally original take on the cynical investigator, the prose occasionally employs self-consciously "literary" phrasing that feels more constructed than organic, and a few expressions border on cliché, slightly diminishing its claim to flawless authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story achieves strong atmospheric cohesion and thoughtful integration of its core elements, but the stylistic ambition sometimes results in overly elaborate phrasing that could be tightened for the highest tier of literary publication, preventing it from feeling entirely flawless.</comment>
