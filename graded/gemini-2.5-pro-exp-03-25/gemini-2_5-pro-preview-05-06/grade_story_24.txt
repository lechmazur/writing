<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character is more archetype than individual; "ordinarily extraordinary" attribute is ill-defined and clumsily phrased.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Plot is a static, repetitive cycle; the "apologetic text" timeframe feels like an inorganic, imposed thematic note, not a plot driver.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Setting concept (Mount Tome) is imaginative, but the "apologetic text" timeframe and smuggled screens feel tonally dissonant with the ancient, rock-carved world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Impact relies on some evocative imagery, but the "emotional alchemy" is frequently asserted rather than deeply earned through subtle showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Core premise (dentures, bard) offers novelty, but execution leans on sentimental tropes ("stir hearts grown cold") and some self-conscious literary phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Ambitious conceptual blend, but elements lack seamless cohesion; the "apologetic text" timeframe feels particularly forced, hindering overall organic development.</comment>
