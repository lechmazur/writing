<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character's "torment" and the planetarium origin of his fate feel superficial and clich√©d, weakening motivational depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear for a snapshot, but the causal link from "planetarium show" (as "method") to the doll and fate is tenuous and inadequately explained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elements are present but the crucial planetarium backstory feels like an imposed device, not an organically integrated foundation for the narrative's weight.</comment>
