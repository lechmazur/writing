<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The agoraphobia is potently conveyed and central; however, the "mayor" role feels less impactful on the immediate narrative unfolding in the dunes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong arc and pacing to a resonant climax; the acceptance of the "ludicrous" rain method feels slightly under-justified by Alistair's internal state in the moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptionally strong sensory details and atmospheric cohesion; the setting is deeply integral to the character's experience and the story's mystical elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Powerful symbolism and a nuanced psychological resolution stand out; some key emotional shifts or beliefs are stated directly rather than fully shown through action or deeper internal monologue.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The rain-rhythm mechanism for the snuffbox is fresh; the central realization about the 'crack' being internal, while fitting, echoes a known psychological narrative pattern.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Impressive cohesion of elements to serve the central theme; the "mayor" identity contributes less dynamically to the core conflict's resolution within this specific scene than other assigned elements.</comment>
