<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's core attribute (selective mutism) shapes his reliance on Pip effectively; however, the rapid activation of his new, profound motivation, while seeded by prior belief, feels somewhat accelerated for such an introverted character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc of internal transformation spurred by the 'patronize' action, but the 'accidental' tuning of the receiver, while fitting the premise, is a slightly convenient inciting incident.</comment>
