<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc and integrates the "confine" action effectively, though the inciting "chance encounter" feels somewhat conventional for this tier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The verbatim repetition of "lavishly austere" in the concluding sentence is a notable flaw, and reliance on the "ancestral key" trope lessens originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements combine effectively for a cohesive narrative, though the "paladin" aspect remains underutilized, slightly weakening overall thematic resonance and distinction.</comment>
