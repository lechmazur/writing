<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The character's core motivation (liberation) and its evolution are well-defined and drive his internal arc; however, the assigned attribute "elegantly clumsy" feels somewhat superficially applied rather than deeply integrated into a wider range of his actions or personality beyond navigating obstacles.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear internal arc and coherence within the word limit, pivoting effectively on the re-evaluation of the "dissect" action; the inciting action of fixing the lift provides a good frame, though the primary "action" is internal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Sand Castle Preservation Lab setting is exceptionally well-chosen, powerfully enhancing the themes of impermanence and fragility, and works seamlessly with the "dissonance of silence" concept; sensory details effectively build atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional impact through potent symbolism (flower crown, sandcastles) and a clear thematic exploration of acceptance; a few instances of directly stating internal states ("Alistair felt a familiar ache") slightly diminish the "show, don't tell" principle at the highest level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative demonstrates originality in its combination of elements and handling of the ghost-seer trope, avoiding clich√©s and maintaining a fresh voice; the prose is clean and purposeful, without resorting to formulaic phrasing or generic descriptions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story feels remarkably cohesive, with assigned elements largely serving the narrative's subtle epiphany rather than feeling forced; it leaves a lingering sense of quiet understanding, demonstrating effective use of its constrained length.</comment>
