<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strength: The urban orchard vs. solar panels setting creates a potent symbolic atmosphere. Weakness: While evocative, sensory details could be more distinct and consistently immersive to reach exceptional levels.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strength: Central metaphors (pruning fate, mapping possibilities) are intelligently woven and thought-provoking. Weakness: Some key thematic statements (e.g., "bittersweet grit") are delivered too directly, lessening subtextual power.</comment>
