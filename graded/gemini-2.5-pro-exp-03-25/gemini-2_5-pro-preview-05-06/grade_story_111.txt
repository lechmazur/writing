<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Motivation is clear, but the "deserted" aspect is superficial and the "theoretically intuitive" attribute isn't convincingly portrayed or impactful.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>A coherent emotional arc for a vignette is present, driven by the "savor" action, but external plot progression is minimal, hinging on a future imagined event.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Core alchemical/dream concept is strikingly original, yet occasional reliance on slightly ornate or familiar emotional descriptors ("burning ache," "gnawing dilemma") tempers its overall freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Demonstrates creative combination of many assigned elements, but a few, like the "dog park" and "theoretically intuitive," feel less organically essential to the core narrative.</comment>
