<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "openly private" attribute, while referenced, feels more asserted by the narration than deeply and subtly embodied in Elara's actions or internal monologue, slightly limiting full character depth despite clear motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves a remarkably complete and satisfying narrative arc—clear setup, rising action, climax, and resolution—with effective pacing, all impressively managed within the tight word constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (smell of behemoth, thrum of the floor, texture of the ladle/meteorite) and the masterful use of scale (giants, their accoutrements) create a deeply immersive and fittingly perilous atmosphere.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The noticeable repetition of key assigned phrases ("openly private," "gentle turmoil," full "witch's gnarled wooden ladle") and a few instances of slightly ornate prose ("potent promise") detract from the otherwise original combination of elements and overall polish.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully weaves most assigned elements into a cohesive and imaginative narrative, delivering a clear emotional journey and a lingering sense of quiet triumph, showcasing strong creative integration.</comment>
