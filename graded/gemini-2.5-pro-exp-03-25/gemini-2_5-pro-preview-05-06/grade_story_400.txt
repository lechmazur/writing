<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's 'fiercely ambivalent' nature, attributed to the 'tremor of purpose', is impactful, but Elara's own fierce ambivalence could be more dynamically shown; her motivation to overcome fear is, however, clear and resonant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear and satisfying micro-arc driven by the core action ("gather"), effectively structuring the internal journey toward 'breaking the silence' within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional, immersive world-building; the unique "glacial orchard" setting and rich sensory details are deeply integrated, profoundly amplifying thematic concerns of fragility and solitude.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong use of resonant imagery (e.g., "words...like the first stones dislodged in an avalanche") and symbolism (the meal, the safety pin) creates a poignant emotional impact and a memorable narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Largely original execution with a distinct voice, though minor repetitive word choices ("precarious," "fragile") and a stock phrase ("crippling fear") slightly detract from an otherwise polished and fresh narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements are seamlessly integrated into a cohesive and evocative narrative that lingers, demonstrating strong creative synthesis and a deliberate, impactful use of brevity.</comment>
