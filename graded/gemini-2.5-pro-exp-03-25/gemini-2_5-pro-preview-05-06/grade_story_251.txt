<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The core attributes ('happily sad,' 'bashful arrogance') establish a distinct persona, but the 'ambivalent' aspect of the prophet feels somewhat underexplored beyond these more explicit labels and her core motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Achieves a concise arc with the 'final oath' as a clear catalyst, though the symbolic resolution of a single 'click' feels somewhat simplistic given the cosmic stakes involved in altering fate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The desolate lunar setting effectively enhances the story's atmosphere of quiet, grand rebellion, though minor anthropomorphic details like 'humming marbles' slightly dilute the otherwise stark profundity.</comment>
