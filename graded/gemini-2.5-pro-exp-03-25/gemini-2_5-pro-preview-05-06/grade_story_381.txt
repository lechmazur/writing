<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kael's "hushed" attribute is well-realized and consistent with their internal focus. However, the "necromancer" aspect feels somewhat underleveraged in actively resolving the scene's core tension, serving more as a premise for Pip's existence than a dynamic tool Kael employs against immediate apprehension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story presents a clear micro-arc of confronting and managing internal fear. However, the pivotal "dominate" action against apprehension culminates in a passive and slightly convenient receding of the environmental threat ("seemed to recede"), which lessens the impact of the achieved resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "crystalline cave" setting and "scarcely abundant" light effectively establish a fittingly alien and apprehensive mood, with the "baseball cap" providing a strong contrasting anchor. Some descriptions of the cave's unique properties, however, such as its energy, lean on somewhat standard phrasing rather than truly novel sensory detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story features a unique character pairing and uses the "baseball cap" and "old movies" for effective symbolism. However, it leans heavily on the declarative phrase "sound of resolve" (and its variations) rather than more deeply *showing* the experiential or sensory nature of this internal state, making a key concept feel told more than felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The core concept of a "hushed necromancer" with a spectral, film-loving companion offers distinct originality. The resolution of the cave's "awareness" ("seemed to recede") feels somewhat unearned, diminishing the tension built around this element and softening the storyâ€™s potential for a more robust confrontation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates a notable ability to cohesively blend its disparate assigned elements into a readable narrative. For publication at the highest tier, however, the engagement with the central conflict feels too gentle, and the thematic device of "resolve" could be explored with greater depth and less direct statement.</comment>
