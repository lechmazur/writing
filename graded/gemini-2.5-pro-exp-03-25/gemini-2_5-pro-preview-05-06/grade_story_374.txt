<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>A coherent vignette with effective pacing for its length, but the plot is slight, relying on interaction rather than significant progression or high stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The futuristic pastoral setting is exceptionally well-realized with strong sensory details, creating a unique and immersive atmosphere; this is a standout strength.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Evocative prose, effective symbolism (the stamp), and natural dialogue create a gentle, thoughtful impact; the ending is fitting for its slice-of-life nature.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story presents an original blend of speculative elements and introspective themes, largely avoiding clich√©s, though the "minstrel" character tag feels somewhat superficially applied.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>A cohesive and atmospheric mood piece where most elements serve the quiet narrative well; its strength lies in tone rather than dynamic plot.</comment>
