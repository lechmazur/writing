<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The 'lapsed priest' and abacus elements are well-integrated, but the 'unapologetically confused' trait is asserted rather than consistently embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The 'jog' effectively structures the vignette, yet the narrative lacks a conclusive arc, feeling more like a snapshot than a complete story.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The symbolic beanstalk setting and 'dull radiance' create a potent atmosphere, but the sensory details are somewhat narrowly focused.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Originality in the premise is high, subverting tropes well; however, minor phrasal repetitions slightly weaken the otherwise distinct prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elemental cohesion is a key strength, crafting a thoughtful mood piece, but its vignette form limits its overall narrative impact for top-tier publication.</comment>
