<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "expectantly resigned" attribute and core motivation are effectively portrayed, but the "sentient doll collector" aspect, while establishing character, feels less dynamically integrated into her immediate actions within this specific narrative compared to her other inherent qualities.</comment>
