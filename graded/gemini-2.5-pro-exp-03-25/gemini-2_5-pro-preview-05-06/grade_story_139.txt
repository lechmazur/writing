<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clear motivation and consistent "stubborn" trait, but the "monk" aspect feels somewhat superficial and the character's emotional depth is more stated than fully plumbed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Effective mini-arc and pacing for its length, but the reflection's rationale for leaving interpretable tooth marks, even corrupted ones, strains credulity without more substantial narrative grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong immediate atmosphere and sensory detail ("scent of pine," "phantom chill"), effectively establishing the "cautious enchantment" tone; however, past world elements feel more informational than seamlessly integrated into the present immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The core concept of flute analysis is unique and the thematic twist ("reclaim and purify") is intelligent, but the final thematic explication is overly direct, diminishing potential for resonant subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The method of investigation is strikingly original and the prose is proficient; however, the foundational "dark reflection" is a familiar trope, and the narrative voice, while clear, doesn't achieve exceptional singularity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Most elements are creatively integrated into a cohesive and imaginative narrative; however, the "creased shipping label" feels like a perfunctory plot device, lacking the thematic resonance of other components in an otherwise promising piece.</comment>
