<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Significant weakness: Initial "fact-mindedness" is more asserted than deeply demonstrated through action prior to the crisis; the subsequent profound shift feels narratively accelerated for a "resolutely" defined character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Significant weakness: The pivotal epiphany, while plot-functional, occurs with a swiftness that slightly strains credulity for such a fundamental change, making it feel more narratively convenient than psychologically deep.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Significant strength: The unstable dimension and the contrasting "whispered minute" create a compelling atmosphere that intrinsically supports and enhances the narrative's turn towards non-logical understanding; some descriptions are evocative but not uniquely groundbreaking.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Significant weakness: The crucial realization of empathy is conveyed more through direct exposition of the character's internal conclusion ("This...was the true path") rather than a more nuanced, shown process of discovery and integration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Significant strength: The central conceit of charting an unstable dimension by "echoes of profound feeling" is highly original and effectively freshens an otherwise familiar character arc. Weakness: Some attributive phrases, while purposeful, border on repetitive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Significant weakness: While exceptionally cohesive in its use of elements, the story's core psychological transformation feels compressed, prioritizing narrative efficiency over the deeper, more gradual unfolding expected for a "resolutely" defined character facing a paradigm shift.</comment>
