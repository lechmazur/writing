<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character is functional and consistent, but the assigned attribute "theoretically rebellious" is stated rather than embodied, making her feel more like a patient scholar than a true rebel and flattening her emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot structure is exceptionally tight and effective for its length, presenting a complete and satisfying narrative arc (setup, climax, resolution) with clear cause-and-effect and excellent pacing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The world-building is the story's greatest strength; the atmosphere is immediately established with potent, specific sensory details that are deeply integrated with the plot, character, and theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable cohesion, using the central metaphor of 'translation' to brilliantly unify its many assigned elements into a memorable and thought-provoking whole, despite minor flaws in character nuance.</comment>
