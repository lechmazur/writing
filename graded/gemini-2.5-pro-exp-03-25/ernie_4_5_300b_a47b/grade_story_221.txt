<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character’s emotional arc is strong, but the "wreck-diver ghost whisperer" descriptor feels like an unfulfilled promise. It adds flavor but is not meaningfully integrated into her actions, which are entirely psychological and terrestrial.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is an exceptionally tight and complete emotional arc for the word count. The only minor weakness is the use of the "half-written letter," which functions as a slightly heavy-handed expository device.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's greatest strength. The sensory details are specific, evocative, and masterfully employed to create a palpable sense of melancholic nostalgia and decay that perfectly supports the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The literary craft is superb, particularly the use of symbolism (amber, targets) and the resonant final metaphor of tradition as a bridge. The story successfully 'shows' the character's internal transformation through a powerful central action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>While the theme of confronting grief is common, the unique combination of elements feels fresh and authorial. The prose style is lyrical yet controlled, avoiding cliché and establishing a distinct voice. The "learned to swim" payoff is a mark of genuine craft.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story is a polished, cohesive, and emotionally resonant piece that would stand out in a slush pile. It demonstrates a sophisticated fusion of assigned elements into a powerful narrative, marred only by the slight disconnect of the character's profession from the central conflict.</comment>
