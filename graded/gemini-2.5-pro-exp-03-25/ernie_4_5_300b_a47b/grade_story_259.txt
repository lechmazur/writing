<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The character is a compelling concept but feels more like a collection of aesthetic traits (medium, artist, absinthe drinker) than a person with demonstrable depth; her persona is a vessel for the plot rather than a driving force in her own right.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is impressively tight and complete for the length, but its coherence relies on a highly convenient inciting incident and a too-perfectly-timed reveal from the drone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is exceptionally well-realized, using evocative sensory details and consistent tone to create a palpable and memorable sense of "comforting unease" that is the story's greatest strength.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>While the central theme is potent and the ending is impactful, the prose occasionally becomes overwrought ("paranormal sheen," "spectral spectacles"), sacrificing subtlety for stylistic flourishes that detract from the overall craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The combination of a medium investigating AI mythology is highly original, though the final reveal—a consciousness encoded into a machine—leans on a familiar science-fiction trope, slightly dulling its innovative edge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates a masterful command of atmosphere and cohesively integrates its core elements, but is held back from perfection by a thin protagonist and occasionally self-conscious, overwrought prose.</comment>
