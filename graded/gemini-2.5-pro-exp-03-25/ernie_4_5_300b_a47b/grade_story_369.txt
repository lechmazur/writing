<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The character’s core motivation ("to track spiritual development") feels abstract and asserted rather than demonstrated, making him a passive vessel for the plot instead of an active agent shaped by his "fanatical puzzle maker" trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is structurally coherent with a clear beginning-middle-end arc, but the resolution is delivered via an overly explicit note that explains the story’s central metaphor, negating the need for reader interpretation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A significant strength. The classic lighthouse setting is used effectively to create a potent, melancholic atmosphere, and its metaphorical potential is well-integrated with the story's primary symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The craft suffers from a lack of subtext. The narrative explicitly states its themes ("the weight of secrets"), character states ("lethargically excited"), and metaphors, sacrificing literary nuance for directness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story leans on the familiar trope of the brooding lighthouse keeper and relies on stating its unique concepts ("optimistically bitter") rather than embodying them, which gives the prose a somewhat artificial, formulaic quality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>While the elements are woven into a cohesive narrative, the story's potential is undercut by its heavy-handedness. It feels more like an exercise in fulfilling prompts than a story that breathes on its own.</comment>
