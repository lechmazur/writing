<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The character's emotional arc is compressed and formulaic, resolving complex internal states with a single line of dialogue from an external source. The "mocking affection" tone is stated but not embodied, leaving the character's voice feeling generic rather than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the plot is coherent, its central cause-and-effect relies on a simplistic catalyst. The protagonist's profound change happens too quickly, making the plot feel more like an allegorical summary than a believable narrative progression within the word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The interstellar setting is powerfully evocative and thematically resonant. However, the central object—a bird's nest—feels like a terrestrial cliché shoehorned into an alien environment, slightly undermining the world's internal consistency despite attempts to integrate it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story sacrifices subtext for explicit thematic statements, particularly in the final paragraph. While the imagery is strong, the craft is undermined by a tendency to "tell" the reader the moral, which robs the narrative of lasting intellectual or emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The originality of the sci-fi premise is undercut by a highly formulaic emotional arc and reliance on inspirational platitudes ("You're enough," "carry your cracks like constellations"). The narrative follows a predictable template of healing, lacking the messy nuance of genuine human experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story is a polished synthesis of its given elements but lacks narrative friction. The character's journey is overly smooth and the thematic resolution so tidy that it feels schematic rather than organic, prioritizing a neat message over compelling, complex storytelling.</comment>
