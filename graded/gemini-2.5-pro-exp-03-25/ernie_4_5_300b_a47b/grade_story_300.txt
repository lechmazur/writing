<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The character's pragmatism is demonstrated flawlessly, but the "wistful" aspect of his assigned attribute feels more asserted by the narrator than organically shown through his actions or inner monologue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot is a model of economy and coherence; it establishes a clear problem, method, and resolution arc within the tight word count, driven logically by the central action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The world-building is exceptional, using specific, evocative sensory details to create a gritty, immersive atmosphere that perfectly complements the character's pragmatic and determined nature.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The craft is strong, particularly in its use of a central metaphor (pragmatic puzzle-solving vs. superstition) and a thematically resonant ending. The narrative voice is distinct and compelling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The piece achieves a remarkable cohesion, with all elements serving a clear, central theme. It feels less like an exercise in incorporating prompts and more like a deliberate, focused work of flash fiction with a lingering impact.</comment>
