<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The character concept of a "social media exorcist" is compelling but functions more as an exotic label than an integrated aspect of her character; her core skills are irrelevant to the plot. The stated motivation of "indifferent enthusiasm" is an unconvincing paradox, told to the reader twice but never convincingly shown in her actions, which read as straightforwardly curious and engaged.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear, albeit rapid, arc within the word count, but its coherence relies on convenience. Key plot mechanics, like the password being on the receipt and the bartender's immediate recognition of Jessa, feel contrived and sacrifice narrative logic for pacing and mood, making the progression feel more like a checklist of events than an organic story.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story's primary strength is its atmosphere. The author uses specific, evocative sensory details ("neon signs bleeding," "paint peeling like old skin," "cracked and sticky with spilled soda") to build a tangible, noir-infused world. The decaying physical setting is a perfect, meaningful counterpoint to the central theme of a persistent "digital afterlife."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The piece demonstrates strong craft in its imagery and unique conceptual framework, but its impact is blunted by a final act of overt exposition. The bartender's monologue spells out the entire theme and Jessa's new role, a classic case of "telling" that undermines the subtext and prevents the reader from arriving at the conclusion organically.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative is built on a foundation of highly original concepts ("social media exorcist," "viral hauntings," reigniting the digital/real) that feel fresh and contemporary. It skillfully avoids cliché, presenting its tropes—like the secret speakeasy—in a context that renews them. The voice is distinct and the ideas are genuinely inventive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story is conceptually brilliant and atmospherically rich, but it reads like an exceptional first draft. The execution is hampered by underdeveloped characterization and a plot that favors convenience over causality. For a top-tier publication, it's a "not yet," a promising piece that needs a revision to deepen its narrative mechanics beyond the impressive surface.</comment>
