<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The attribute "fiercely loyal" is asserted but never demonstrated; Jessa's actions are driven by internal anxiety, not loyalty, making the core assigned trait feel disconnected from her actual characterization and arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story presents a complete and coherent arc, but the central epiphany feels rushed. A single, simplistic joke is a somewhat flimsy catalyst for such a profound psychological shift, weakening the credibility of the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A significant strength. The moth tower during the outage is a uniquely resonant setting, creating a powerful atmosphere of "sanctified dread" where the moths serve as a perfect, living metaphor for the story's themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>While the craft shows promise with strong imagery, the story undermines its literary potential by having a character explicitly state the central theme ("Balance isn't stillness..."). This heavy-handed telling dilutes the subtext and impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The originality of the moth-tower setting is undercut by a reliance on the well-worn trope of a quirky secondary character delivering a clich√©d life lesson ("dancing in the storm") to the troubled protagonist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The piece is cohesive and effectively integrates most elements into a resonant narrative. However, its tendency to state its theme directly, rather than trusting its otherwise strong metaphorical structure, holds it back from top-tier publication.</comment>
