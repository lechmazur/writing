<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot arc is impeccably structured and coherent for its length, but its resolution is too swift and predictable, lacking significant narrative friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise is highly original, but the narrative relies on a familiar "overcoming fear" template and includes awkward phrasing ("sincerely rare") that breaks the otherwise smooth prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable cohesion, weaving its disparate elements into a unified whole, yet it lacks the raw complexity or ambiguity expected of top-tier literary fiction.</comment>
