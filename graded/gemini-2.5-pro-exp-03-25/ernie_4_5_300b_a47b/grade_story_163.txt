<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The character is a collection of assigned traits rather than a developed personality. We are told she is "bitterly optimistic," but we are only shown a generic recklessness. The "lost heiress" backstory feels like an extraneous detail that has no bearing on her actions within the station, rendering her motivation thin and her voice indistinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story presents a complete arc, but it does so at a breakneck pace that sacrifices all depth. It reads like a synopsis or a movie trailer, ticking off plot points (detour, confrontation, breakthrough, resolution) so rapidly that none of them have any narrative weight or consequence. The structure is coherent but entirely superficial.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story's primary strength lies in its atmospheric world-building. The imagery of geodesic domes, migrating cloud-shadows, and bioluminescent fungi is evocative and effectively supports the high-concept sci-fi theme. The setting is the most successfully realized aspect of the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The craft is undermined by a heavy-handed "tell, don't show" approach. Symbolism (the stub, the symbiote "stitches") and themes are explicitly stated rather than allowing the reader to infer them. Phrases like "architect of unity" are self-aggrandizing authorial intrusions that belong in a summary, not in the prose itself, stripping the story of subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The narrative is a predictable assemblage of genre clich√©s: the troubled runaway genius, the gruff scientist won over, the symbolic discarding of a memento. The emotional arc from "fragmented" to "whole" is stated rather than earned, following a formulaic template that lacks any genuine emotional resonance or originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story feels overstuffed, a clear case of the elements dictating the narrative rather than serving it. The need to incorporate every prompt point results in a story that is broad but shallow, touching on many ideas without exploring any of them. The brevity feels like a constraint that forced a summary, not a deliberate stylistic choice.</comment>
