<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character’s motivation is stated too explicitly ("I sculpt possibility..."), replacing nuanced revelation with a declarative statement. The transition from "visceral terror" to serene confidence within a single, brief encounter feels emotionally compressed and lacks the gradual development expected in top-tier fiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is a clean, effective arc for the word count, but its inciting incident—"the sound of a key turning in the lock"—feels mechanical and imposed, functioning more as a prompt constraint than an organic element of the world. The resolution is tidy to the point of being simplistic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is strong, but the connection between the primary setting (the room) and the secondary setting (orbital debris) relies on a stated, somewhat cliché metaphor ("shattered dreams") rather than a deeply integrated, functional relationship. The world feels like a collage of interesting but not fully synthesized concepts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>While the craft is evident, the story sacrifices subtext for clarity. Key thematic lines like "I am the inheritance" are delivered directly to the reader, undermining the power of showing over telling. The symbolism, while present, is overt rather than layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The combination of sci-fi and exorcism is fresh, but the piece relies on a few well-worn tropes, notably the "ghost as a manifestation of guilt" and the clichéd metaphor of "orbital debris... as shattered dreams." This reliance on familiar shorthand prevents it from feeling entirely original.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story is a highly competent execution of its constituent parts, but it reads like a superior writing exercise. The elements feel artfully combined rather than emerging from a singular, inevitable vision, leaving the hand of the author too visible for truly immersive, top-echelon work.</comment>
