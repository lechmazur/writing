<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The character is consistent and her motivation is clear, but the core attribute "discreetly flagrant" is explicitly stated at the outset rather than revealed purely through action, a minor shortcut for this level of fiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a remarkably complete and coherent arc within the tight constraint. The central action, "polymerize," is a sophisticated and effective driver for the narrative from setup to resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's crowning achievement. The "magnetic field anomaly" setting is not mere backdrop; it is woven into the plot and theme, externalizing the internal conflict with palpable sensory detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Craft is exceptionally high, primarily through the central metaphor of the curse as a "polymer." This conceit provides thematic depth, elevates the narrative, and ensures the story resonates beyond its surface plot.</comment>
