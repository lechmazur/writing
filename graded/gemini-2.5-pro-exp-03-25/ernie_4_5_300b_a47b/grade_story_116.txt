<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The character serves the story’s concept but lacks a distinct voice or personality beyond his stated obsession. His 'subjective rationality' is more of an applied label than a deeply explored trait, rendering him a somewhat thin vessel for the narrative's allegory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story follows a clear and complete arc, but the resolution feels more symbolic than earned. The central action of 'excavating' by arranging photos results in a metaphysical breakthrough that is too convenient, weakening the narrative's cause-and-effect logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The world-building is visually inventive and establishes a strong, memorable atmosphere. However, it verges on being a collection of striking but disconnected images; the 'garden secrets' feel particularly extraneous to the core setting of the sky-lounge and city.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The use of symbolism is potent but heavy-handed, leaving little for the reader to uncover. Key emotional moments, like the 'laconic and exuberant' laugh, are told rather than shown, which undermines the craft and keeps the story from achieving genuine emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>While the premise is highly original, the prose occasionally feels overwrought, as if striving for a specific literary style. Some metaphors land beautifully ("boundaries weren't lines but scars"), while others feel constructed and overly deliberate ("map of time’s failures").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is an ambitious and intelligent assembly of disparate elements, but it never fully transcends its construction. The authorial hand is too visible, resulting in a piece that feels more like a successful, high-level writing exercise than an organic, breathing narrative.</comment>
