<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "mercenary" label is unearned and feels superfluous; the character reads as a generic "haunted man," with his supposed profession adding no meaningful texture to his actions or mindset.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The sudden, unexplained appearance of a second chunk of amber for the climax constitutes a critical plot hole, rendering the story's central resolution illogical and incoherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's standout achievement; the collapsed cathedral setting is masterfully realized and thematically resonant, creating a potent and memorable world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>While the symbolic craft is strong, the story's impact is nullified by the narrative's logical failure. The emotional catharsis is asserted rather than earned, feeling abrupt and overly convenient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The narrative relies heavily on the "magical artifact for redemption" trope. The originality of the setting cannot fully compensate for a conventional plot and a resolution ("puzzle solved by fate") that leans on clich√©.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story is ultimately a failure. Despite its significant atmospheric strengths and often elegant prose, a foundational and inexplicable flaw in plot mechanics makes it structurally unsound and unpublishable.</comment>
