<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear, but the 'physician' trait is vestigial and character depth limited for top-tier work; "quietly dramatic" is asserted rather than fully embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Structurally complete, but severe pacing issues, especially in a rushed climax, undermine narrative weight and the resolution of its grand stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Atmospheric 'dire enchantment' is achieved, but the primary setting (digital nomad camp) feels superficial and its potential for thematic contrast is underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The coffee-ground divination offers a novel touch, but the narrative leans heavily on common genre tropes without significant subversion or fresh perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elements are combined, but key aspects like the protagonist's profession feel arbitrary and poorly integrated, and the narrative lacks the polish and depth for exceptional work.</comment>
