<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Clear motivation for an archetypal character; lacks deeper, unique individualization beyond the thematic role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Structurally sound and complete arc for its length; plot progression relies on a conventional redemption narrative and a convenient catalyst.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The "corroded rapture" concept provides a potent, unique atmospheric anchor; specific "Japanese" cultural detail in the castle setting is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Effective thematic symbolism and evocative imagery are strong; impact is slightly blunted by overly explicit thematic statements, particularly at the resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>While "corroded rapture" is a fresh tonal element, the core redemption arc and several key phrases ("stirring something dormant," "weight lifted") tread familiar literary ground.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesively integrates elements with resonant metaphors (seeds, broken pieces); overall narrative feels more beautifully competent and thematically straightforward than exceptionally groundbreaking or complex.</comment>
