<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The narrative is marred by occasional clich√©s (e.g., "darkness swallowed him whole") and a prose style that sometimes feels overly ornate, lacking consistent freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Despite ambitious thematic reach and atmospheric setting, flaws in character attribute integration and an overly explicit resolution prevent it from achieving true distinction.</comment>
