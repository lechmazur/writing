<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation ("to sculpt a new tomorrow") is clear and his actions as a "deceptive" tailor align, but the "restless" attribute feels underdeveloped, and the character lacks profound internal complexity for the highest tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, but the connection to the "bookshop mysteries" timeframe feels tenuous and doesn't substantially drive or enrich the core rebellion narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The "biodome on Mars" setting is atmospheric and well-utilized; however, the "amid bookshop mysteries" timeframe feels jarringly incongruous with the Martian survivalist-rebellion tone, weakening world cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story excels in its use of symbolism (lantern, stitches) and a strong central metaphor of rebellion woven into fabric, creating a notable thematic impact despite its brevity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the Mars tailor concept offers some originality, the narrative relies on fairly conventional rebellion tropes and the integration of certain specific elements (e.g., "bookshop mysteries") feels somewhat formulaic or prompt-driven rather than organically emergent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The core concept of a rebellious tailor on Mars is compelling, but the forced inclusion of disparate elements like "bookshop mysteries" creates noticeable seams, preventing the story from achieving a truly seamless and flawless artistic cohesion expected at the highest level.</comment>
