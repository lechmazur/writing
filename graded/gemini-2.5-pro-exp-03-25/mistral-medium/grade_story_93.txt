<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The "labyrinth architect" attribute feels more like a label to support the story's metaphors than a deeply integrated trait driving unique actions; the crisis and motivation are clear, but character agency beyond reacting to symbolic input is limited.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot is a coherent internal journey with a clear arc, but its progression relies heavily on a sequence of symbolic revelations rather than strong external drivers or character-led actions; pacing is dense for the word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The elevator setting effectively creates a liminal, introspective atmosphere that supports the internal conflict and symbolic nature of the story; sensory details are present but not exceptionally striking.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story is rich with literary devices and subtext, creating a strong thematic impact; however, the density of overt symbolism and somewhat common final epiphany ("You are the labyrinth") can feel heavy-handed, diluting subtlety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the combination of core metaphors is original, the prose is consistently and intensely "literary," sometimes bordering on overwrought, and the explicit articulation of thematic understanding can feel less authentic than a more nuanced revelation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The elements are very tightly, almost self-consciously, interwoven in service of a dense symbolic narrative; while creative, this intensity can make the story feel more like an intellectual exercise than an effortlessly profound piece, slightly hindering overall impact.</comment>
