<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Bard is functional but archetypal; "meandering" attribute not deeply explored, motivation is clear but internal depth lacking for top-tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Clear arc and effective resolution of the "apology" timeframe; "sowing rebellion" aspect could be more nuanced or distinctly realized beyond general emotional thawing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Strong imagery and emotional beats, but weakened by explicit "telling" of the object's power and by significant stylistic repetitions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Notable repetition of key descriptive phrases ("labyrinthine," "fractured idyll," "warmth") creates a sense of formula and diminishes freshness, bordering on stylistic obviousness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Ambitious integration of elements with a strong central image, but stylistic repetitions and passages of "telling" over "showing" prevent it from reaching top-tier publishability.</comment>
