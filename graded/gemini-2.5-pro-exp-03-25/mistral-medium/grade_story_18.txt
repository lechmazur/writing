<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elias's unique premise is undercut by superficial development; Liora is a sketch, their bond rushed and unearned, lacking the psychological realism expected for publication.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Initial atmosphere is strong, but the "steam-powered" elements remain decorative rather than integral, failing to create a truly immersive and functional world that influences events.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The narrative feels constrained by its elements rather than liberated by them, leading to an underdeveloped core plot and a sense that the story serves the prompts more than its own organic life.</comment>
