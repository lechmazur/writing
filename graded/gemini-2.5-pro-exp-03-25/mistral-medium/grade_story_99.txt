<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and evolves, but the character utterly fails to embody the assigned "strictly casual" attribute, appearing consistently intense and burdened, which is a significant mismatch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a coherent arc and effectively uses the flashbacks for exposition within the word limit, though the initial motivation statement could be sharper.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is exceptionally well-realized, creating a strong, supportive atmosphere rich with sensory details that enhance the story's core concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates good craft with evocative imagery and symbolism, but its thematic statements are often too direct, lacking the subtext expected at the highest tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>While the chopstick wrapper is an original touch, the narrative relies on several common tropes ("forbidden knowledge," "ultimate price") without significant subversion, and some phrasing feels overly declarative rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story cohesively integrates most elements, but the complete absence of the "strictly casual" character attribute and the lack of genuine "subtlety" in the assigned tone are considerable flaws.</comment>
