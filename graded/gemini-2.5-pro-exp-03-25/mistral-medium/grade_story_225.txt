<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The "unjustly fair" attribute is superficial and unintegrated; the character's pivotal transformation from healer is asserted rather than deeply shown, lacking nuanced development for this echelon.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The core action's mechanism—a *dry* pen creating a *glow* tracer via Morse code "infection"—is ill-defined and strains narrative logic, even for a fantastical premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The steampunk setting and "between broken treaties" timeframe are powerfully fused, creating a vivid and thematically resonant atmosphere, a clear strength.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (deck as church, pen as sacred tool) is often explicitly stated, and lyrical prose occasionally tips into being overwrought (e.g., "chaos of his heart"), diminishing subtlety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The original combination of elements is promising, but the forced "unjustly fair" attribute and some explicitly stated emotions betray artifice over organic storytelling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Imaginative premise is hobbled by logical gaps in core mechanics (dry pen/glow) and superficially integrated character attributes, preventing overall cohesion at a "flawless" level.</comment>
