<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The character's "hardheaded" trait is present in his initial defiance, but the subsequent transformation to surrender, while thematically crucial, feels somewhat swift, potentially underplaying the depth of struggle a truly hardheaded individual might endure before such a profound shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc and thematic resolution within the word limit; however, the transition from seeking the physical "safe" to grasping the internal "secret" happens rapidly after the prophecy's introduction, making the resolution feel slightly easily won after the initial setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The "ephemeral art gallery" set "amid snow days" is exceptionally well-realized, creating a potent, cohesive atmosphere rich with sensory details that beautifully underscores the story's themes of transience, fragility, and introspective discovery. This is a significant strength.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong literary craft through evocative imagery, potent symbolism (the frost-words, the dissolving page), and a lyrical style that effectively conveys its theme of surrender. The ending is purposeful and offers a satisfying thematic closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The core conceit of the "ephemeral art gallery" and the "frost words" provides notable originality. While some phrases are familiar, the overall narrative avoids overt clich√©s and presents a fresh perspective on the "price of power" theme, showing nuanced emotion rather than merely stating it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story exhibits strong cohesion, skillfully weaving its assigned elements into a narrative that feels purposeful and thematically resonant.
