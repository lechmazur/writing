<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The "obituaries for the living" trait feels more like an interesting but underdeveloped label than a deeply integrated driver of his actions within this specific narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While possessing a clear arc, the "labyrinth of choices" concept remains somewhat superficial, and the plot progression, though swift, could benefit from more impactful articulation of key turning points.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong central imagery ("giant's bookshelf") and atmospheric tone ("lucid frenzy"), but the integration of fantastical elements occasionally prioritizes effect over grounded internal logic, and the revolution backdrop is faint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Ambitious use of imagery and symbolism, but the density of the prose occasionally verges on overwrought, potentially obscuring rather than enhancing subtext in such a short piece.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While avoiding common AI tells and showcasing a distinct style, the pervasive high register and recurring thematic phrases risk feeling mannered or overly deliberate rather than organically nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Impressively cohesive given the element density, but the narrative sometimes feels constrained by the need to incorporate every assigned piece, slightly diminishing a sense of effortless, organic flow.</comment>
