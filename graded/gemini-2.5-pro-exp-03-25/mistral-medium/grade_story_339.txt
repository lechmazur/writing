<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's "joyless performer" trait is well-established through backstory and current regret; motivation is clear, but the "performer" aspect is somewhat passive in the immediate narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc and coherence; however, the "method" (seesaw echo) functions more as a symbolic impediment to the "action" (organize) than a direct means of achieving it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Excellent synthesis of setting (prismatic lake, construction) and timeframe to create a potent symbolic atmosphere that mirrors the character's internal conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong literary craft with effective, layered symbolism (knob, seesaw, lake) and a resonant emotional core; however, some metaphors are explicitly signposted ("a metaphor for...").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Largely original prose and fresh metaphors, but the repeated and slightly forced application of "modestly extravagant" to "burden" feels like an authorial contrivance to fit the prompt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically resonant, successfully integrating most elements; the interpretation of the "method" element in relation to the "action" is creative but indirect, slightly diluting its assigned function.</comment>
