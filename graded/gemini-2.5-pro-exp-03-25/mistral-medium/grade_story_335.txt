<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The "shaky" attribute is stated but not meaningfully demonstrated; the character acts with more determination than trepidation. Motivation is clear, but the internal shift towards acceptance feels somewhat abrupt rather than a deeply earned transformation. "Carefully reckless" is present but not consistently or profoundly explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "improbable rumor chains" serve as an underdeveloped premise rather than an active method within the narrative. The pivotal confrontation with the past is too compressed ("The past unfolded... 'You can’t change it'") and told, diminishing its impact. The plot arc is present, but its central emotional turning point feels rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cathedral setting and the "slow fade of an echoing hour" create a strong, evocative atmosphere that supports the story's mystical elements and the character's internal state. Sensory details are generally well-employed. The street artist, while fitting, borders on being a convenient prophetic device.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story relies heavily on the central symbolism of the amber and spider, which is its strongest craft element. However, the key realization is stated directly ("he realized—peace wasn’t in the past") rather than fully shown. The artist's dialogue is somewhat on-the-nose. The theme of letting go is clear but handled with a resolution that feels a little too neat for the buildup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The narrative employs some repetitive phrasing ("improbable longing," "carefully reckless," variations of "hour's fade") that feels slightly mannered. While the setting offers freshness, the core plot device of a magical portal to confront the past and the ultimate lesson of acceptance are common tropes. The swiftness of the internal resolution lacks deep human nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a notable atmospheric cohesion and the central metaphor is potent. However, for the highest tier, the narrative arc feels somewhat predictable, and the resolution relies more on declaration than on a deeply explored internal struggle. The brief length feels appropriate for a vignette, but the depth of character change within it is constrained.</comment>
