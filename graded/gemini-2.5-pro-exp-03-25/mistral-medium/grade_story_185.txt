<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Key attribute "infuriatingly calm" is stated rather than shown; character depth beyond plot function is limited.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Evocative core setting ("probability mapping center") and integrated tone ("fractured grace"), but lacks consistent, rich sensory details for the center itself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Impressively cohesive and creative use of disparate assigned elements, achieving thematic resonance despite minor stylistic flaws and a somewhat abstract conflict.</comment>
