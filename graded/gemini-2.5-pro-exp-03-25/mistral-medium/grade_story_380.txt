<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "mathematically challenged" attribute is superficially integrated, offering little to character depth or action, a notable weakness against an otherwise compelling portrayal of a "dream thief" driven by fragmentation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot achieves a clear, impactful arc within the word limit, using the "plunge" effectively as a climax, though the mechanism of survival feels somewhat asserted rather than fully earned by preceding events.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting and timeframe create a powerfully desolate and symbolic atmosphere, with sensory details like "old glue and older lies" significantly enhancing the story's mood and thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of imagery and symbolism (e.g., scattered pages as shattered dreams) crafts a story rich in subtext and emotional resonance, with a purposeful, albeit bleakly hopeful, ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative offers a fresh perspective on post-apocalyptic loneliness through its unique protagonist, largely avoiding clich√©s with vivid, original metaphors, though a rare phrase occasionally echoes familiar literary sentiment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong cohesion and creative integration of its core elements, leaving a lingering, haunting impression due to its distinctive style and thematic depth, despite minor points that could be sharper for top-tier publication.</comment>
