<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear, but the follow-through on her stated core belief (shooting stars as the key) is weak, undermining the depth of that conviction as a character trait when the resolution arrives from a different source with a rather abrupt "revelation."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The core plot mechanism is flawed; the established "method" (shooting stars) is not the one that yields the solution, leading to a coherence issue in the problem-solving aspect of the narrative and feeling like an unfulfilled promise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong, evocative atmosphere effectively created through well-integrated setting, timeframe, and sensory details, significantly enhancing the story's emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Evokes emotion and uses some effective imagery, but the central "revelation" feels somewhat convenient rather than earned through prior narrative development, and there's some reliance on telling emotions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Relies on some familiar tropes (ancestral unfinished work, inspiration from nature) and fairly common literary expressions without offering significant subversion or strikingly fresh language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>While emotionally engaging, a key assigned element (the method of tracking shooting stars) is poorly integrated into the plot's resolution, creating a structural weakness that prevents the story from feeling entirely cohesive or ingeniously constructed.</comment>
