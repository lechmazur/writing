<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elias is more a functional prophet than a deeply nuanced individual; his "whimsy" feels somewhat superficial against his stark truthfulness and lacks deeper exploration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and efficiently paced, but the "artist" subplot feels somewhat detached from Elias's central struggle until its symbolic payoff at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The central image of the suspended palace is highly evocative and atmospheric, strongly supporting the narrative's themes of fragility and imminent decay; sensory details are well-employed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rich in potent symbolism (thermometer, melting palace), but some thematic pronouncements via the fortune-teller are overly direct, lacking the subtlety expected at the highest literary tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements is creative, but reliance on "ignored prophet" and "cyclical ruin" archetypes, without truly radical subversion, tempers its claim to absolute originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story is ambitious and thematically resonant, skillfully weaving its assigned elements, yet minor conventional moments and a desire for sharper phrasing prevent it from "flawless" status.</comment>
