<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Weakness: The protagonist's "jaded" attribute is superficial and swiftly abandoned without sufficient exploration; the supporting scientist character is a flat, one-dimensional plot device defined solely by "genuine strangeness."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Weakness: The assigned action "globalize" is clumsily integrated through strained metaphors; the plot's resolution, with crystals suddenly producing a "map of a future," is an unearned deus ex machina, and the pacing of this reveal is too rapid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strength: The crystal laboratory setting and the pre-fireworks timeframe effectively create a potent, mystical atmosphere, enhanced by generally good sensory details which support the narrative's speculative elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Weakness: The thematic resolution (fate as a canvas, scalpel as a brush) feels somewhat simplistic and overly declared rather than subtly shown; the "map to the future" is a narratively convenient but emotionally unearned turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Weakness: The term "globalize" feels overtly like a mandated element being forced into the narrative rather than an organic choice; the story leans on the amnesia trope resolved by a magical item leading to a generically hopeful outcome.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Weakness: The integration of several core elements, particularly the action "globalize," feels contrived; the narrative relies on a too-convenient magical solution for its optimistic conclusion, diminishing its literary depth.</comment>
