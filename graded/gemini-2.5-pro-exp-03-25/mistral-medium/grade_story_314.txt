<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character's transformation from enforcer to guide is too rapid and lacks sufficient internal exploration for this tier; "overworked" attribute is superficial.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot achieves a clear arc efficiently but feels overly linear and transformation pacing is rushed for its thematic ambition; "exact second" trigger lacks deeper resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The kelp forest setting provides a strong, evocative atmosphere, but the "observation post" aspect feels underdeveloped and not fully integrated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>While element combination is novel, the core narrative relies on familiar tropes (flawed utopia, sudden awakening) without truly groundbreaking subversion; emotional development feels somewhat programmatic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elements are creatively assembled but their integration feels somewhat conspicuous, with the story struggling to fully transcend its constructed nature for seamless literary depth.</comment>
