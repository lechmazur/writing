<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The poet character leans on familiar archetypes ("repressed," "terrified of blank page"), and the stranger serves more as a simplistic plot device with an unconvincingly rapid transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The central plot turn, the stranger's immediate conversion upon smelling perfume, is a significant contrivance that severely strains narrative credibility, even within a symbolic framework.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The overgrown, reclaimed city setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, effectively establishing mood, though the "stardust" in the perfume's scent verges on cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While possessing some fine imagery, the story explicitly states its central thematic realization ("the poem was already written"), which lessens the impact that a more subtle, shown revelation might achieve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The originality of the perfume-as-poem concept is undermined by the use of character tropes (repressed poet, hungry-eyed stranger) and a narratively convenient, rather than organic, resolution to the conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story's lyrical ambition and thematic depth are evident, but a crucial plot point—the stranger's abrupt change of heart—feels unearned and overly symbolic, preventing the narrative from achieving flawless cohesion.</comment>
