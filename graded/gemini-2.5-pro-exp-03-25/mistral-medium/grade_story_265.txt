<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The "impassive" trait feels superficial and underdeveloped, poorly reconciled with the deputy's profound seeking; the narrative doesn't sufficiently explore the tension this juxtaposition should create.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent but slight for its literary ambitions; the resolution, particularly the bee on the windowsill, verges on being too conveniently symbolic and neat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a notable strength, yet the "orchard spanning rafters" image, while evocative, strains verisimilitude without stronger narrative grounding, risking a dip into the whimsical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Literary devices are present, but symbolism (twist tie, bees) is often too explicit, lacking the nuanced subtext and ambiguity expected at the highest level of literary craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The consistently lyrical prose occasionally becomes overly ornate ("heartbeat of metal and memory"), and the earnestness lacks the innovative voice or grit that elevates a story beyond proficient.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates cohesion and thematic intent but ultimately falls short of flawless execution, feeling more like a well-crafted exercise than a deeply resonant, original work.</comment>
