<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The character's assigned attributes ("daydreaming," "seldom regular") feel superficial and somewhat contradicted by her focused, tireless actions. Her motivation is clear but grandiosity clashes slightly with the "daydreamer" label. The connection between personality and method is tenuous.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc (discovery, creation, completion) within the word limit. The action drives the narrative, and the method, while fantastical, is internally consistent thanks to the satellite sliver. Pacing is adequate, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The setting (submerged palace, post-glacier melt) is evocative and works well with the method (skating rink). The "pristine chaos" tone is stated but not fully realized atmospherically; the mood feels more determined and hopeful. Sensory details are present but could be more immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism effectively (palace as canvas, marks as compassion). The central theme is clear and consistently conveyed. However, the narrative relies more on stating the theme ("testament to," "power of compassion") than purely showing it through action and subtext. Emotional impact is moderate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The combination of elements is somewhat original, but the execution feels slightly formulaic in its inspirational tone. Phrases like "testament to" are repeated. The satellite sliver enabling precise carving feels like a convenient plot device rather than an organic development. Emotional depth is stated rather than deeply evoked.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story struggles to make the disparate elements feel entirely cohesive; the satellite sliver, in particular, feels somewhat grafted onto the core concept. While the narrative functions, it reads more like an exercise in fulfilling prompts than a story where elements arise organically from a central vision.</comment>
