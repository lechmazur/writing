<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation (restore lost art) is clear and drives action. However, the 'rebellious' attribute feels asserted rather than demonstrated organically through nuanced choices or voice; it merely justifies the unusual occupation. Character depth is limited within the scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The core action (manifesting obituaries via the organ/mask) provides a clear, albeit fantastical, plot structure with a discernible arc. However, the 'labyrinth of choices' concept remains largely metaphorical and doesn't substantially influence the plot mechanics. Pacing is adequate, but coherence suffers slightly from the underdeveloped 'revolution' backdrop.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The 'giant's bookshelf' setting offers striking imagery but feels disconnected from the human-scale stories Lyra writes and the 'rumors of revolution' timeframe, creating a slight dissonance. The atmosphere within the organ chamber supports the method effectively, but the broader world lacks integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story presents a unique concept (living obituaries) and uses evocative imagery (shifting mask, skeletal pipes). It successfully conveys the theme of reclaiming life. However, the impact is slightly diluted by the peripheral, underdeveloped 'revolution' element, and the ending feels somewhat neat rather than deeply resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While the core concept is original, the execution relies on some familiar tropes (magical artifact, hidden chamber, rebellious artist). Phrasing occasionally borders on ornate ("perched precariously," "dizzying labyrinth," "lucid frenzy"). Emotional nuance is conveyed primarily through the mask mechanism rather than deep character insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion around the central concept and Lyra's actions. The elements related to the obituary writing process (mask, organ, motivation) work well together. However, the integration of the setting's scale and the revolution timeframe feels less organic, preventing seamless unity.</comment>
