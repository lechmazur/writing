<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character traits like "amiable" and "doubly singular" are asserted rather than demonstrated through action or nuanced voice, weakening the portrayal's depth and authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The plot relies heavily on internal realization triggered by a supernatural event, lacking significant external development or tension beyond the passive waiting; the resolution feels vague ("a word").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strengths lie in the effective integration of the haunted lighthouse setting and the sensory details used to build a palpable, resonant atmosphere that supports the core concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While atmospheric, the story lacks significant emotional impact or deep subtext; relies on telling emotions ("smile of hope") and somewhat common metaphors (crossword), limiting its overall craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The piece leans on familiar tropes (sensitive academic, haunted location) and uses some slightly clunky, self-conscious phrasing ("doubly singular," "humble rebellion"), lacking a truly distinctive voice or originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The elements feel somewhat mechanically assembled rather than organically interwoven; the story fulfills the prompt requirements but doesn't transcend them to feel truly necessary or leave a lasting impression.</comment>
