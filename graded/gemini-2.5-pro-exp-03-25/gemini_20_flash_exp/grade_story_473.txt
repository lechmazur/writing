<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and consistent, but the 'calculatedly unpredictable' attribute feels asserted through narration and metaphor (pruning) rather than demonstrated through distinct, unpredictable actions within the scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story functions more as a static character portrait than a plot-driven narrative. The 'pruning' action is symbolic, and the 'brochure' method occurs off-stage, failing to drive immediate plot progression. Lacks a compelling arc within the scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Excellent atmospheric contrast between the orchard and solar panels, effectively supporting the tone. However, the 'workshops' timeframe feels poorly integrated, mentioned rather than woven into the present action or setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance regarding leadership and effective use of symbolism (maps, pruning). However, the craft relies too heavily on stating internal states ("felt the weight," "knew that") rather than consistently showing through action or nuanced observation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The combination of elements (cartographer, orchard, brochures) offers originality, but the execution leans on the familiar 'reluctant leader' trope. Some descriptive language borders on the overwrought ("oppressive gaze," "fragile dreams").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>While thematically coherent, the integration of assigned elements feels uneven; the method and timeframe seem less organically incorporated than other elements, making the piece feel somewhat constructed around requirements rather than flowing naturally.</comment>
