<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot coherence suffers from unexplained core elements (origin/purpose of packages, setting juxtaposition); the ending feels abrupt, lacking resolution or satisfying resonance within the tight constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The setting (space station) and timeframe (farmland boundary) juxtaposition feels arbitrary and illogical, significantly weakening world coherence and immersion despite some atmospheric details.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The combination of elements offers surface originality, but the execution relies on some standard phrasing and the core concept lacks truly groundbreaking insight or style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Cohesion is significantly hampered by the poorly integrated setting and timeframe elements, making the story feel more like a collection of assigned prompts than an organic whole.</comment>
