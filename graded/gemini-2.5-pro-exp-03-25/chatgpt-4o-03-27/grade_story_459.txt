<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation (liberation) is stated clearly but feels somewhat externally imposed rather than deeply woven into the immediate action until the end. The 'elegantly clumsy' attribute is described but doesn't significantly influence events or reveal deeper character, feeling more like flavour text. The core trait (seeing ghosts) drives the plot, but the 'elevator repair technician' aspect feels arbitrary and disconnected from the central narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear, albeit simple, arc within the word limit, moving from discovery to interaction to resolution. The metaphorical use of 'dissect' works adequately. However, the introduction of the 'staking out ghost tours' method feels like an abrupt backstory insertion rather than an organic part of the present action, slightly weakening coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sand castle lab setting is highly original, atmospheric, and thematically resonant (preservation vs. erosion/letting go). Sensory details ("salt-stained glass," "humming dehumidifiers," "knees crunching sand") effectively establish the unique world. The lunchtime timeframe provides a plausible constraint for the encounter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (crown, collapsing cathedral) and evocative imagery ("silence... echoed in Eliotâ€™s ribs like a struck bell"). The story successfully conveys a theme of processing grief and memory ('letting go was not forgetting'). The central conflict is primarily internal but effectively mirrored in the ghost interaction. Shows emotion well, particularly through the ghost's silent presence and Eliot's reaction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The core concept and combination of elements feel original. While the prose is generally strong, phrases like "elegantly clumsy grace" and "aching precision" border on slightly overwrought or familiar literary phrasing. The emotional arc feels mostly authentic, avoiding purely stated emotion, though the resolution is perhaps a touch too neat for the established 'complex simplicity'.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most elements into a cohesive, atmospheric whole, particularly the setting, object, and core concept. The brief length feels appropriate for the focused encounter described. It leaves the reader with a distinct mood and thematic resonance concerning memory and acceptance.</comment>
