<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marlo's transition from "kingpin" to hopeful planter is established, but the "nervous" trait feels overshadowed by defiance and hope; his core motivation is clear, but the initial descriptor feels slightly misaligned with the dominant portrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear, resonant arc within the word limit, driven effectively by the central action (planting). The detour mechanism feels slightly convenient, but overall coherence and pacing are strong for a short piece.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The midwinter, xenophobic enclave setting is powerfully evoked and intrinsically linked to the core concept (forbidden gardens) and Marlo's actions, creating a palpable atmosphere of oppression contrasted with fragile hope. Sensory details are well-employed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance (memory, resistance, hope) achieved through potent symbolism (seeds, garden) and evocative language. The ending is purposeful, and the central conflict is clear, leaving a lasting emotional impact despite the brevity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>While employing familiar dystopian tropes (oppressive regime, symbolic act of defiance, child representing hope), the specific focus on flora and the generally restrained, evocative prose elevate it beyond pure formula. Some phrasing ("tyranny of indifference") borders on clich√©, but overall avoids egregious AI tells or excessive ornamentation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its core elements into a cohesive and emotionally resonant whole. The assigned components feel largely organic to the narrative, serving the theme and character arc effectively within the constrained format, suggesting depth beyond the surface plot.</comment>
