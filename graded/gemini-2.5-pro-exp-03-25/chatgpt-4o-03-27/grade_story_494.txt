<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The transformation from "arrogant" and "doubtfully confident" to resolved feels abrupt within the scene; the internal shift, while central, lacks sufficient grounding or struggle shown within the narrative's present moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc, but the central 'action' ("authorize") is purely metaphorical/internal, making the pivotal change feel somewhat sudden and intellectually asserted rather than dramatically earned within the tight constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Excellent use of the calligraphy courtyard setting to contrast with the swordsman and establish a potent atmosphere of silence, memory, and introspection, strongly supporting the narrative's themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong literary craft with effective symbolism (tapestry, carving "Begin") and evocative imagery; however, the emotional impact is slightly lessened by the rapid, somewhat declared nature of the character's internal resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the prose is generally polished and avoids overt AI tells, the core redemption arc feels familiar, and some descriptive phrases ("whispering of forgotten strokes") lean towards well-worn literary tropes rather than striking originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The assigned elements are integrated cohesively, serving the central theme of transformation. The story feels complete for its length, but the overall execution, while competent, doesn't quite transcend its familiar structure to achieve exceptional impact.</comment>
