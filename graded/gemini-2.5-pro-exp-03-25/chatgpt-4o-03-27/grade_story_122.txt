<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (trauma/vengeance), but the character feels archetypal. The "patiently frantic" attribute is stated rather than convincingly demonstrated through action or internal thought. The "cyber-templar" aspect feels superficial, lacking meaningful integration beyond humming armor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot follows a standard structure (setup, confrontation, resolution) effectively within the word count. The action ('prove') and method (prism) are central. However, the progression feels somewhat predictable for a lone-warrior-confronts-nature narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The sky burial setting provides strong atmosphere and thematic resonance with death and exposure. The connection between the bridle (memory/past life) and the bone altar works well. Sensory details are present, though some are conventional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Relies heavily on evocative but sometimes overwrought imagery ("each hue a scream") and explicitly stated themes ("safety was never given..."). Symbolism (prism, bridle, storm) is clear but lacks subtlety. The core conflict is present, but the emotional impact feels asserted rather than earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The combination of sci-fi (cyber-templar) and primal ritual offers surface originality, but the execution leans on tropes (traumatized warrior, mystical artifact vs. nature). Language occasionally borders on purple prose ("vengeance in geometry"). Lacks deep emotional nuance; euphoria is stated directly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story successfully incorporates the required elements, but their integration sometimes feels mechanical rather than organic (especially the cybernetics). The style is consistent but overly reliant on heightened descriptors. It achieves cohesion but lacks the subtlety and depth expected for top-tier publication.</comment>
