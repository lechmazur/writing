<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is explicitly stated rather than deeply shown through nuanced action or internal conflict; the 'spirited guardian' aspect feels underdeveloped beyond her immediate actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The resolution feels abrupt and overly optimistic; the mechanism for 'dethroning cynicism' lacks convincing narrative weight or demonstrated impact beyond a fleeting moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The setting, while evocative, occasionally borders on twee and feels constructed solely for the plot's mechanics; the 'grit' aspect of the specified tone is less realized than the 'ethereal'.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Thematic statements are too explicit (e.g., grandmother's quote, final DVD message), diminishing the impact of subtler symbolism and preventing genuine reader discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Relies on somewhat precious imagery ("forgotten constellations") and risks sentimentality; some phrasing feels overly ornate rather than genuinely fresh or insightful.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Integration feels somewhat schematic, with the narrative arc serving the prompt elements rather than emerging organically from character and situation; the ending feels preordained.</comment>
