<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The assigned "dry-witted" attribute is stated but not demonstrated through action, dialogue, or internal monologue, weakening the characterization. Motivation is clear, but the voice lacks exceptional distinction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent with a clear arc (task completion -> reflection/action -> resolution) within the word count. However, the resolution (light restored by dance) feels slightly convenient and abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Excellent atmospheric creation through strong sensory details ("peeled wallpaper," "wind whispered," "rusted nail"). The haunted setting effectively enhances the theme and Rook's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (rope, dance, light) and a clear theme regarding tradition. The craft is solid, but the subtext isn't particularly deep, and the ending feels somewhat predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The writing avoids obvious AI tells and clich√©s, demonstrating competence. However, it lacks truly fresh figurative language or a highly distinctive authorial style, feeling well-executed rather than uniquely original.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story achieves good cohesion, integrating most elements effectively in service of the narrative. It functions well as a focused scene but doesn't quite transcend its constraints to reach exceptional literary merit.</comment>
