<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character concept is intriguing (necromancer as cartographer via communion), but the geologist backstory feels slightly appended rather than deeply integrated. Motivation is clear, but the emotional depth relies heavily on the brief brother scene, leaving the core personality somewhat underdeveloped beyond his function.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a commendable arc within the word limit, moving from descent to discovery. The method (film nostalgia) drives the plot effectively. The subversion of the 'dominate' action into an emotional theme ("love... dominate death's silence") is clever, though the initial setup for this feels slightly thin.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The crystalline cave setting is vividly rendered and synergizes well with the flickering memories and phosphorescence. The 'futuristic nostalgia' tone is palpable and effectively contrasts the collapsed surface with the enduring power of old media. "Between sets" remains slightly ambiguous, hindering full immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong use of imagery (flickering film scenes, glowing map lines) and symbolism (the cap). The story evokes a poignant emotional response, particularly with the brother's appearance. The central theme of memory and connection triumphing over loss is clear and effectively conveyed through the narrative's unique blend of elements.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The core concept—necromantic cartography fueled by film nostalgia—is highly original and avoids common genre clichés. The language is generally evocative without being overly ornate. While the emotional beats land, the reasoning behind *why* film quotes work feels slightly underdeveloped, bordering on magical convenience rather than fully explored world logic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates considerable creativity in weaving disparate elements into a cohesive whole. Most elements serve the narrative, though 'sound of resolve' and 'scarcely abundant' feel less impactful than others. The brevity works, creating a snapshot rather than feeling incomplete. It leaves a lingering sense of melancholic hope.</comment>
