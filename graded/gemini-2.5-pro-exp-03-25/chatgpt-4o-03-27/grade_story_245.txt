<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation ("heart's revolt") is clear and drives the plot, but the initial "irate" descriptor feels underdeveloped and somewhat fades, lacking consistent integration into his actions beyond the initial jogging echo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent with a clear arc (ritual -> discovery -> resolution) within the word limit. The tea leaf method driving the descent is acceptable symbolically, though the chopstick prying a sealed hatch strains credulity slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Excellent atmospheric creation; the desolate Martian spaceport contrasts effectively with the internal quest and the eventual discovery. Sensory details are well-employed, strongly supporting the tone and concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance and impactful use of symbolism (chopstick, tea leaves, waterfall). The story successfully evokes emotion and achieves a satisfying, purposeful ending with clear subtext regarding grief and remembrance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>While the core concept is original, the repetition of "heart's revolt" feels slightly formulaic. The smuggler seeking redemption/meaning after loss is a common trope, though handled with some freshness here. Language is mostly strong, avoiding excessive purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive and evocative whole. The brief length feels deliberate, focusing the narrative effectively. It leaves the reader with a lingering sense of melancholic peace.</comment>
