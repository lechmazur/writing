<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The character's repression and terror are stated more than shown through nuanced action. The motivation ("cosmic verse on mortal skin") feels overly grandiose and somewhat disconnected from the immediate, internal struggle depicted. Predictable internal arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The plot relies heavily on internal monologue; the "spontaneous decision" leads to an internal "ambush," which lacks external tension. The beginning-middle-end structure is present but follows a very standard, somewhat thin trajectory for overcoming creative block.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The overgrown setting effectively mirrors the character's internal state, and sensory details are present. However, the "pin drop" timeframe feels abstract and poorly integrated into the tangible setting and ongoing action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Uses familiar symbolism (overgrowth, perfume bottle). The central conflict (internal doubt) is clear but resolved somewhat too neatly. Relies on telling emotions ("secretly terrified," "fear loomed") alongside showing. Some imagery borders on clich√© ("tangled thoughts").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Relies heavily on the common "repressed/blocked artist" trope without significant subversion. Phrases like "woven itself into the very fabric," "lingering doubts," "shadows of doubt," and "spark of inspiration" are tired. The "cosmic verse on mortal skin" is purple prose. Lacks a unique voice or perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>While achieving basic cohesion, several elements (notably the "pin drop" timeframe and the "cosmic verse" motivation) feel forced rather than organic. The story serves the elements rather than the elements serving a truly original narrative. Predictable internal journey.</comment>
