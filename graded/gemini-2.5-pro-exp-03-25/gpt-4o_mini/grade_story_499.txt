<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (reclaiming identity), but the 'poetically rational' attribute feels asserted rather than demonstrated. The sandals effectively symbolize her past, but her internal voice lacks true distinction, and the shift feels slightly underdeveloped for a top-tier piece.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a basic arc (despair to resolution) within the word limit, driven by reading the coded stanzas. However, the 'corrode' action is merely descriptive background, not a plot driver. The ending feels somewhat abrupt and overly neat, lacking nuanced resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The underground orchard setting is vividly realized with bio-luminescent fungus, creating a strong, unique atmosphere. The juxtaposition with the distant orchestra tuning is effective. The setting strongly supports the themes of hidden potential and rebirth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Uses symbolism (sandals, orchard) effectively and presents a clear internal conflict/resolution. However, the emotional impact relies more on stated feelings ("felt the weight," "surge of inspiration") than deep showing. The theme is clear but lacks profound subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the setting offers originality, the core narrative (artist finding their voice) and some phrasing ("igniting a fire," "flowed like water") lean towards clich√©. The emotional progression feels somewhat predictable and lacks the nuanced, specific detail expected at this level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story integrates most elements adequately, particularly the setting and object. However, some elements ('poetically rational', 'corrode') feel less integral. The brief length contains the arc, but the overall execution lacks the depth and stylistic finesse required for the highest tier.</comment>
