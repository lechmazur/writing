<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The character's core trait (phobia-ridden) drives the internal conflict, but the 'stunt double' aspect feels superficial and disconnected from the library setting and resolution. Motivation shifts awkwardly from seeking solace to treasure hunting via a map. The reaction to the net is overly literal symbolism rather than nuanced character revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The plot follows a basic arc (discovery, journey, resolution) driven by finding the map (envelope). However, the connection between the inciting incident (seeking solace from garage-sale-filled life) and the climax (unraveling a net in a pyramid) feels contrived. The resolution via the net metaphor is abrupt and simplistic within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The pyramid library setting offers initial atmosphere ("shadows danced," "dusty aisles"). However, the connection between this grand, ancient setting and the character's modern anxieties/background (stunt work, garage sales) is tenuous and underdeveloped. The 'mundanely spiritual' concept clashes with the exotic setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story attempts symbolism (net = fears) but executes it heavy-handedly. The central conflict is clear but resolved too neatly. While some imagery is present, the overall impact is diminished by cliché phrasing ("weight lift from her shoulders," "woman reborn") and telling rather than showing emotional shifts. The theme of overcoming fear lacks subtlety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The combination of elements is unusual, but the execution relies on predictable tropes (facing fears literally, treasure map in ancient place, symbolic object). The emotional arc is generic. The language sometimes dips into cliché ("symphony of triumph"). The connection between disparate elements like garage sales and pyramid libraries feels forced, lacking organic integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The story struggles for cohesion; the assigned elements feel more like a checklist being ticked off than parts of an organic whole. The garage sale timeframe and stunt double background clash jarringly with the pyramid library setting and net-unraveling climax. The central metaphor is too obvious, hindering depth.</comment>
