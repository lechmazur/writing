<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Motivation is stated but feels abstract and disconnected from the 'desert wanderer' background within the immediate scene; character actions (spotting planet) serve the plot more than revealing nuanced personality. Jax is a stock character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The plot progresses from observation to decision, forming a mini-arc. However, the core method ('investigating everyday miracles') is poorly demonstrated by the inciting incident (spotting a unique planet). Coherence suffers from disparate conceptual elements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The immediate setting (crow's nest) is evoked adequately with some sensory detail ('rust', 'hum'). However, the assigned timeframe ('when the orchard’s last apple finally falls') feels like tacked-on backstory, poorly integrated with the present atmosphere and setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Relies heavily on telling emotions ("heart racing", "surge of gratitude") rather than showing. Symbolism (ruler, apple) is present but lacks subtlety. Dialogue is functional but unremarkable. The theme of 'mapping love' is stated explicitly, missing opportunities for subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Combines familiar tropes (space pirate, grizzled captain, quest for ancient knowledge) without significant subversion. Phrases like "thick with the scent of rust and adventure" and "eyes sparkled with determination" feel cliché. The core concept feels intellectually imposed rather than emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The story struggles to cohesively integrate its disparate elements (desert wanderer, space pirates, love-mapping ruler, apple memory); they feel more like required inclusions than organic parts of a unified vision. The result lacks depth and feels somewhat formulaic.</comment>
