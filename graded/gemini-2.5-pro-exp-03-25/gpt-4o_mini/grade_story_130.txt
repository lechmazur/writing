<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The character arc from 'lost apprentice' to sharing her story is too rapid and lacks convincing internal development; the motivation is stated but not deeply explored or earned through nuanced action or reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc (problem-realization-resolution), but the resolution feels abrupt and unearned within the word count; the metaphorical use of 'reverse-engineer' is somewhat superficial.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The 'interstellar orchard ship' setting is evocative and provides a unique atmosphere, but it remains largely a backdrop rather than being deeply integrated into the character's internal journey or the plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Relies heavily on telling emotions ("felt a strange kinship," "felt the weight of acceptance") rather than showing; the symbolism of the nest is overt and lacks subtlety, diminishing potential impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a predictable 'finding oneself' template; language occasionally dips into clich√© ("whispering secrets," "stars twinkled," "winds of change"), lacking a truly distinctive voice or original perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The story feels constructed *around* the assigned elements rather than having them emerge organically; the brevity highlights the challenge of integrating disparate concepts cohesively, resulting in a slightly forced feel.</comment>
