<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The character is a collection of stated attributes ("late-blooming hero," "softly militant") rather than a developed personality. His actions—scholarly research and stargazing—feel disconnected from the "militant" descriptor, making his core nature feel asserted rather than demonstrated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story presents a complete and coherent arc, but it does so by summarizing events rather than dramatizing them. The plot progresses logically but feels rushed, like an outline, sacrificing narrative tension for expediency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The setting concept is strong, but the execution lacks evocative, specific sensory details. The world is described ("crumbled into dust," "rooftop farm") but never truly rendered, preventing genuine immersion and leaving the atmosphere feeling thin.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The narrative relies almost exclusively on telling rather than showing. Emotions, motivations, and character traits are stated outright ("The gravity of loss weighed heavily," "determination he never knew he possessed"), which robs the story of subtext and emotional impact. The craft is transparent and heavy-handed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>1.5</grade><comment>The story is built on a foundation of well-worn tropes: the brooding post-apocalyptic hero, the secret knowledge that explains the cataclysm. The prose uses formulaic "literary" phrasing ("architecture of cosmic balance," "bridge the gap between destruction and renewal") that feels calculated and artificial, lacking a unique authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>While the assigned elements are cohesively integrated, the story reads as an exercise in fulfilling a prompt. The narrative is constructed *around* the elements, rather than using them in service of an organic story, resulting in a piece that is technically sound but lacks creative spark or emotional resonance.</comment>
