<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The character's core attribute "fierce" is merely stated, not demonstrated; her actions are exclusively gentle and persuasive, creating a fundamental dissonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The plot resolution is critically weakened by a lack of earned struggle; the captain's "strongest resistance" capitulates without any convincing process, making the climax feel perfunctory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the "sunken zeppelin" setting is wonderfully evocative, the specified "calm frenzy" tone is not achieved; the prose embodies the "calm" but only asserts the "frenzy," leaving the atmosphere half-realized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The narrative relies excessively on telling the reader about emotions, themes, and character traits ("her movements embodying," "her eyes held both compassion and determination") instead of showing them through subtle action and prose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.0</grade><comment>The constant, verbatim repetition of the assigned element phrases makes the story feel rigidly formulaic and artificial, as if constructed from a checklist rather than written with an organic, authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The story has a highly creative premise but feels more like a summary or an outline; the elements are present but not seamlessly integrated, and the execution lacks the narrative depth to support the weight of its ideas.</comment>
