<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The core "surly" attribute is merely stated and then explained away; it is not convincingly demonstrated through the character's actions, which read as more contemplative than hostile.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is functional and complete, but the "market wisdom" concept feels intellectually grafted onto the plot rather than serving as an organic driver of events.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>This is the story's singular triumph. The integration of the graveyard setting, the transitional season, and the overall tone creates a potent and memorable atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The use of symbolism is effective, but the story's literary potential is squandered by the final two paragraphs, which explicitly state the subtext and theme, showing a lack of faith in the reader.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The premise is original, but the prose falls into a formulaic pattern of tidy emotional arcs and on-the-nose thematic declarations, feeling more like a polished AI execution than a piece with a distinct human voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Despite its superb atmosphere, the story is built on a weak character foundation and concludes with a narrative clumsiness that would preclude it from publication without a significant rewrite.</comment>
