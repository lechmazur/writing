<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "woodsman" label feels disconnected from the character's technological actions and obsession with radio waves, weakening an otherwise strong and believable emotional portrait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is exceptionally tight and coherent for its length. Its primary weakness is a reliance on a perfectly timed symbolic climax that feels slightly too convenient for the highest literary standard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The "radio wave garden" is a brilliantly original and atmospheric concept. However, it functions more as an effective symbolic backdrop than a fully realized, tangible world, leaving its own logic unexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story's craft is its greatest strength, built on a powerful and sustained central metaphor of mapping. It is held back only by the final paragraphs, which over-explain the theme, sacrificing subtext for summarization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>While the premise is highly original, the perfect allegorical structure—where external events precisely mirror internal states—verges on a predictable, fable-like template, lacking a degree of chaotic human nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story demonstrates masterful cohesion of its disparate elements into a powerful whole. Its primary flaw is its own symbolic perfection; the narrative's neatness lacks the messy ambiguity often prized in top-tier literary fiction.</comment>
