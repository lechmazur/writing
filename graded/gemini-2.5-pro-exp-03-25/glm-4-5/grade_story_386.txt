<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The character is an archetype defined by telling, not showing. The assigned attribute 'trustworthy strange' is asserted but feels disconnected from her solitary actions in the narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Structurally sound with a clear arc, but the conflict's resolution is too simple and immediate, lacking a sense of genuine struggle or cost at the climax to make the victory feel earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The central concepts of the setting—the atom-powered lighthouse on a temporal boundary—are evocative and well-integrated, representing the story's strongest feature.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Over-reliance on stating themes and emotions directly ("her motivation burned," "quiet defiance became a roar"). The elevated prose sacrifices nuance for unearned grandeur.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Follows a familiar 'last survivor' trope without subversion. The prose uses a string of epic but generic phrases and noticeable repetition, feeling more formulaic than authentic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story is a technical success in cohesively integrating its disparate elements. However, the final piece reads like a well-executed synopsis, lacking the literary depth and character nuance for publication.</comment>
