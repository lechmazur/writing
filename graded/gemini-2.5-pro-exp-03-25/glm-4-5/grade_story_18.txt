<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The character is more of a symbolic vessel for the theme than a developed personality. Key traits like "tragically joyful" are stated rather than earned, and the calligraphy method feels arbitrary and disconnected from a stone being.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot follows a predictable, sentimental arc from isolation to connection. The inciting incident (the artist's arrival) feels convenient rather than organically developed, and the action driving the first half is conceptually awkward.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the atmosphere is effectively established, it relies on a generic palette of steampunk tropes (hissing pipes, smog, gas lamps) without adding a truly unique or memorable dimension to the world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The narrative is crippled by its reliance on "telling" instead of "showing." Emotional states, character motivations, and thematic points are explicitly explained to the reader, robbing the story of subtext and genuine impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The story reads like a formulaic exercise, combining common tropes (sentient statue, sensitive artist, superficial society) into a predictable narrative. The prose is clean but lacks a distinctive voice, feeling more like a polished algorithm than an individual author.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>While the story competently integrates its disparate elements, it never transcends being an exercise. It feels constructed to fit constraints rather than like an organic, necessary piece of art, resulting in a technically cohesive but soulless narrative.</comment>
