<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character is defined by explicitly stated traits rather than revealed through action or voice. The internal state is narrated, not evoked, which lacks the subtlety required for this tier of publication.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot relies on a convenient trope (the suddenly noticed trunk) and a compressed timeline. The cosmic scale of the conclusion feels unearned given the brevity of the inciting journey.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core setting ("floating rock dojo") and atmospheric details ("guttering lantern") are highly evocative and represent the story's greatest strength, creating a memorable and fitting world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The craft is undermined by a persistent reliance on "telling" over "showing." The narrative explicitly explains the character's motivations and psychological processes, flattening potential subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The conceptual blend is unique, but the prose follows a predictable, procedural structure. The lack of a distinctive authorial voice makes the execution feel more formulaic than inspired.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the elements are woven together cohesively around a strong central theme, the functional and overly explanatory prose prevents it from achieving literary distinction and would result in a rejection.</comment>
