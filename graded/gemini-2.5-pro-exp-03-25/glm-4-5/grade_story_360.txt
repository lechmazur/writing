<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The character is too passive, a vessel for the theme rather than an agent. His motivation is clearly stated but not deeply explored, and his "necromancer" background feels like inert trivia rather than an active part of his characterization or conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but hinges on a deus ex machina. The resolution—a perfectly formed dew drop providing the answer—is not earned through the character's struggle or ingenuity, but is merely a contrivance of chance, weakening the entire narrative arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest element, effectively using the "playground sounds" to create a unique atmosphere. However, the world feels like a static backdrop; the goblins are props who don't influence the plot in any meaningful way beyond providing scenery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The story fails the "show, don't tell" principle, explicitly stating its theme and the character's realizations ("The answer came not in words but in understanding"). The symbolism is overt and the central conflict is resolved with such ease that it lacks tension or impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the initial concept of a "meek necromancer" is fresh, the execution defaults to well-worn fantasy tropes: the epiphany resolution, the "true magic is balance" moral, and the overly convenient magical solution (the pen working with dew-drop ink), which feels formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The story feels constructed to satisfy a checklist of elements rather than flowing as an organic narrative. The final message is achieved at the expense of narrative rigor, resulting in a piece that is cohesive on the surface but lacks the depth and earned resolution of publishable fiction.</comment>
