<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Weakness: "Underestimated rebel" trait feels somewhat superficial and less demonstrated than asserted. Strength: The "sadly joyful" attribute and the father's knife as a "syllabus on adaptation" are more effectively integrated into her persona and actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Weakness: Assigned action "intensify" is weakly integrated as a plot mover, functioning more as a descriptive atmospheric detail. Strength: Coherent arc and pacing achieve a sense of completeness despite the brevity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strength: Vivid, consistent sensory details (ozone, sugar floss, peppercorn broth) create a highly immersive and fitting "ephemeral gloom" atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strength: Rich, unique imagery (e.g., "syllabus on the art of adaptation," "park reacted like a slumbering beast roused by aroma") and a thematically resonant ending. Weakness: Relentless density of figurative language can feel slightly forced or self-conscious.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strength: Highly original fusion of the haunted park setting with Sichuan hotpot mysticism and the theme of adaptation. Weakness: Consistently ornate prose, while contributing to a unique voice, risks feeling self-consciously "literary" and occasionally overwrought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strength: Impressive cohesion of many assigned elements into an imaginative and largely engaging whole. Weakness: The narrative sometimes betrays its constructed nature, feeling more like a skillful response to a complex prompt than an organically conceived story.</comment>
