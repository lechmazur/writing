<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sentimental and spontaneous traits are well-demonstrated, but the late-stage "welcoming chaos" motivation feels somewhat externally imposed for thematic resolution rather than purely organic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear, but the critical resolution (the vizier's overthrow) is extremely compressed, undermining its narrative weight; the 'boast' action feels awkwardly prompted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story creatively integrates its elements into an ambitious narrative, but its brevity leads to a rushed climax that lessens the overall impact of an otherwise cohesive piece.</comment>
