<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Characters are well-motivated, but their rapid bonding over a niche hobby strains credulity. Rowan's "professionally wild" attribute is more suggested than deeply demonstrated beyond his artistic drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the paddleboarding reveal functions as a somewhat forced plot device to accelerate character connection rather than an entirely organic development.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are strongly evocative and thematically resonant, with sensory details effectively grounding the narrative's more poetic ambitions, though the alpine aspect is somewhat underutilized after initial descriptions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of imagery ("sky bruised yet unbeaten," "glistening like conscience") and symbolism creates profound impact, though the relentless poetic density occasionally risks feeling self-conscious or overly rich for the narrative's length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and the central conceit highly original, largely avoiding clich√©. However, the uniformly elevated and metaphor-heavy style, while often striking, can feel slightly relentless or performative at points.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements are woven together with considerable skill, achieving thematic depth and a strong sense of cohesion. The serendipity of the shared hobby, however, feels like a minor concession to narrative expediency in an otherwise tightly crafted piece.</comment>
