<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Key attributes "logically emotional" and "grandiose modesty" are stated, not subtly shown, undermining depth despite clear motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and paced well under constraint, but the significant internal conflict ("Was blamelessness...") is resolved too cursorily ("answered by working faster").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Evocative setting ("whispering gallery," cathedral) with strong sensory details ("jasmine, loam"), but the gallery's unique psychological potential is underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Strong imagery and a purposeful ending are present, but the impact is lessened by explicit thematic statements (e.g., the final sentence) and directly telling key character attributes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>While containing some fresh metaphors and avoiding major clich√©s, the direct labeling of abstract character traits feels somewhat formulaic, rather than purely organic discovery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story integrates its elements with ambition and has moments of strong writing, but significant lapses in "show, don't tell" for character and theme prevent it from reaching flawless execution.</comment>
