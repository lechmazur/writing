<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Milo's motivation is clear, but the 'rarely frequent' attribute feels more like a convenient circumstance than a deeply defining trait; his internal response to 'shifting loyalties' is stated rather than profoundly explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story presents a complete arc, but the leap from Milo's individual surveillance to the specifics of a major impending summit is quite abrupt, and the resolution of deep-seated distrust is achieved with remarkable speed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The 'nostalgia preservation vault' is rendered with exceptional sensory richness, creating a potent atmosphere that perfectly supports the story's themes and Milo's activities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Striking use of metaphor and a unique narrative voice are clear strengths, though the sheer density of figurative language occasionally risks feeling overly ornate for such a concise piece.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The premise is highly original, and the writing style distinctive, successfully subverting common tropes; however, the persistent richness of prose can, at moments, feel self-consciously 'literary'.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>A commendably cohesive and imaginative narrative given the elements, but the crucial link between Milo's street-level method and the grand scale of the averted crisis relies on significant narrative shorthand.</comment>
