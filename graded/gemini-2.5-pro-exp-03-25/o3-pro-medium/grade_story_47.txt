<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The character's key attribute "eagerly jaded" is awkwardly phrased and feels like an authorial imposition, failing to convincingly ground his extreme interpretation of duty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While atmospheric, the world-building relies on well-worn gothic tropes (silent theatre as "sanctuary," eventual "mausoleum") that lack fresh, arresting originality.</comment>
