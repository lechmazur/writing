<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Iris's internal journey and motivation are clear, but the "late-blooming hero" designation feels somewhat imposed rather than fully demonstrated through impactful external action; her "softly militant" nature is subtly shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a cohesive emotional arc; however, the pivotal discovery of the negatives with their perfectly apt aphorism strains credulity slightly, feeling overly convenient for the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>World and atmosphere are masterfully rendered, with vivid sensory details and the metaphorical timeframe ("between the first tear and the final sigh") being exceptionally well-integrated and resonant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong literary craft and evokes genuine emotion, yet the very high density of figurative language, while often striking, occasionally risks feeling overwrought or self-conscious.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Displays considerable originality in theme and execution with a distinct voice; however, the lyrical intensity, while a strength, sometimes results in phrasing that feels more ornate than organically essential, bordering on purple prose in isolated instances.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A highly imaginative and cohesive piece where elements serve a unified vision; its ambitious poetic style is largely successful but the sheer density of elaborate prose may polarize, hindering flawless clarity for some readers.</comment>
