<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Skepticism arc is present, but the 'conjurer' aspect feels more like a label; character depth is functional for the plot rather than profound.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Inventive structure and the assigned action drives it, but key resolutions (e.g., Venus connection) rely more on poetic assertion than rigorous internal logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative and strong, 'loud silence' well-realized; the setting enhances the method, though some futuristic details feel slightly superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ambitious themes and impactful imagery, but the craft is marred by moments of self-conscious exposition (e.g., the 'literal/figurative' explanation), hindering overall impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Highly original premise, avoiding common tropes; however, stylistic density occasionally borders on overwriting, and one key assigned phrase feels artificially inserted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Creative and thematically rich with generally good cohesion of elements, but a few instances of awkward phrasing or convenient poetic leaps prevent flawless execution.</comment>
