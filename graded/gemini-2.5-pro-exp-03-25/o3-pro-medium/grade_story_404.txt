<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Characters are efficiently drawn with clear motivations; the 'lightly unbearable' attribute is cleverly integrated, though profound psychological depth is somewhat constrained by the story's brevity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A tight and coherent plot driven by a creative method; the crucial 'harvesting' sequence, however, feels somewhat compressed to fit the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptionally vivid world-building and atmosphere are achieved through striking sensory details, effectively grounding the fantastical elements of the setting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors and a distinct authorial voice; the dense, lyrical prose is ambitious and largely successful, though it occasionally risks feeling overwrought to a minimalist sensibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Assigned elements are skillfully integrated into a cohesive, impactful narrative that largely transcends its brevity and component parts, leaving a memorable impression.</comment>
