<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Bram is vivid but his stated "burdens of leadership" lack deep emotional exploration; Mara's rapid transformation from accuser to collaborator lacks sufficient internal justification for this level of critique.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses via clever mechanisms, but key resolutions (Mara's turn, the council's swift appeasement) feel overly convenient and rushed, slightly undermining structural integrity within the constrained length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptionally strong; the evocative core setting (urban orchard overshadowed by solar panels) is richly detailed, thematically integral, and masterfully creates a unique, resonant atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Abundant, often striking literary devices (metaphor, imagery) create a unique perspective, but their sheer density occasionally risks feeling overwrought; the central conflict resolution feels somewhat facile despite thematic neatness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Highly original voice and largely fresh metaphors avoid clich√©; however, the intense, pervasive stylization, while distinctive, constantly skirts the edge of becoming overly ornate or self-conscious.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Creatively combines disparate elements into a largely cohesive and thought-provoking modern fable, but minor underdeveloped character facets and plot expediencies prevent it from achieving flawless execution.</comment>
