<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's 'elegantly clumsy' attribute is pivotal and well-realized, though the initial investigatory method ("staking out tours") feels somewhat superseded by the climactic events rather than directly fuelling the resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Achieves a coherent and satisfying arc within the word limit, but the stated 'staking out' method's direct contribution to the solution is less impactful than the accidental catalyst that propels the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The unique "sand castle preservation lab" setting and the "dissonance of silence" concept create an exceptionally vivid and integral atmosphere, a clear strength of the piece.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative imagery ("unfinished histories like wet cloaks") and purposeful literary devices significantly enhance the narrative's impact and emotional resonance; the craft is largely strong.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates notable originality in its premise and execution, particularly in blending disparate elements like an elevator technician with sand castle ghosts, largely avoiding clich√©.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Exhibits impressive cohesion and thematic depth for its brevity, with most elements serving a unified vision; however, the "staking out" method's integration into the core resolution mechanism feels slightly less impactful than other components.</comment>
