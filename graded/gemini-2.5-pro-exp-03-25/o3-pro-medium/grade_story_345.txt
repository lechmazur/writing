<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's core motivation is clear and compelling; however, the "unapologetically" aspect of his confusion is not convincingly portrayed through his actions or internal state, which leans more towards seeking and acknowledging past failings.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a strong allegorical arc with a clear beginning, middle, and symbolic resolution within the word limit; the magical shift driven by a symbolic act fits the fable-like quality of the narrative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story excels in its use of literary devices, rich symbolism, and subtext, prompting deep reflection; the ending is purposeful and thematically satisfying, showcasing strong authorial craft.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable cohesion, artfully weaving its assigned elements into a profound and memorable allegorical narrative that lingers with the reader; the brief length feels deliberate and impactful.</comment>
