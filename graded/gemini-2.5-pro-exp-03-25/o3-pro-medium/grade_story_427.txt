<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "dueling" aspect feels underdeveloped in the character's present actions, primarily serving as arm justification rather than an active philosophical trait influencing his deconstruction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot coherence suffers from a nebulously defined "duress" for the secret's revelation and an overly convenient, fantastical deconstruction of the lighthouse into a staircase.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Highly original premise; however, the explicit repetition of key abstract phrases ("tangibly abstract," "coded desperation") feels somewhat didactic, lessening organic subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Ambitious and creative integration of elements, yet minor plot contrivances and the unrelenting intensity of its ornate style prevent "flawless" execution without revision.</comment>
