<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Silas is well-grounded; Aurelia's swift trust and the rapid development of "love" between enemies stretch credulity despite poetic phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong arc and pacing; the practical ease of enemy submarine tethering is a narrative convenience undermining the established conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of elements with a distinctive voice; avoids clich√©s and demonstrates fresh metaphorical language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Imaginative and beautifully written; the story's primary weakness is the somewhat idealized speed of emotional de-escalation between declared enemies.</comment>
