<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Corin's 'gentle swordsman' attribute feels somewhat underutilized in its 'swordsman' aspect within this specific narrative's core actions, though his 'gentleness' is evident; Mira's 'faithfully unfaithful' trait and motivation are more seamlessly integrated.</comment>
