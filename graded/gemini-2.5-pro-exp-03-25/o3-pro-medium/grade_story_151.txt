<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Motivation is clear, but the "awed" trait is more of a backdrop than a deeply explored characteristic. The astronomer's significant internal dilemma is introduced and resolved with extreme brevity, lacking nuanced development.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The plot arc is complete within the tight word limit, but the mechanism for toppling a cosmic idol via snowflake-encoded irrigation feels overly reliant on poetic assertion rather than sufficiently developed internal logic, straining credulity even for a symbolic narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exceptionally evocative world-building and consistent atmosphere; the "lighthouse orchard" is a striking and memorable central image, and sensory details are rich, though the mechanics of its existence remain abstract.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Impressive use of literary devices and subtext creates a thought-provoking piece with a purposeful ending. However, the unrelenting density of poetic language occasionally borders on being overwrought, potentially obscuring clarity for the sake of lyricism in a few instances.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>While the core "emotion vs. machine" theme is familiar, the story's specific imagery (veil, snowflake as weapons) and the astronomer's dilemma offer considerable originality. The highly stylized prose, while consistent, sometimes feels more self-consciously crafted than organically flowing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates high ambition and creativity in weaving disparate elements into a cohesive, atmospheric whole. However, the extreme compression and consistently elevated poetic style lead to moments where narrative or character depth feels sacrificed for dense imagery or swift plot resolution.</comment>
