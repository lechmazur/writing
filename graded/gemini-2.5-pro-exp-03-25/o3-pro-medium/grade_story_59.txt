<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Distinct voice and clear primary motivation, but the assigned attribute "strangely predictable" feels superficially integrated and not deeply explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Strong arc and pacing for its length, but the "star trails" method involves a metaphorical leap between sound and light that feels somewhat contrived.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The "echo chamber testing site" setting is superb and atmospherically rich; however, "amid silent struggles" functions more as a mood descriptor than a clearly defined timeframe.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rich in literary devices and evokes emotion, but the relentless density of metaphorical language, while often beautiful, risks feeling stylistically overwrought for some readers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Individual poetic style is evident, but the narrative relies on some familiar tropes (e.g., ghostly visitation for closure, symbolic burial of the past) without significant subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Highly cohesive thematically with creative use of most elements, but some, like "star trails," feel more cleverly incorporated than organically essential to the core narrative.</comment>
