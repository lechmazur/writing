<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The "con artist" persona is effectively realized in the crucial negotiation, and "high-altitude" suits the fantastical setting and initial entry; however, "extraordinaire" feels somewhat self-proclaimed rather than fully demonstrated across a broader range of actions beyond cleverness in one transaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a surprisingly complete and coherent arc within the concise word limit, with clear cause-and-effect. The resolution of the nightmare conflict, while fitting the character, feels slightly too convenient for a truly high-stakes encounter.</comment>
