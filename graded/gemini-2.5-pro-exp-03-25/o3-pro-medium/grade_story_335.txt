<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strengths: "Shaky" attribute effectively shown, motivation clear. Weaknesses: Past artistic skill feels like a slightly too-convenient reveal for the resolution's bargain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strengths: Clear beginning-middle-end arc within word count. Weaknesses: Muralist's rapid agreement to the bargain, while explained, stretches plausibility for a top-tier critical read.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Strengths: Exceptionally vivid and thematically resonant setting; sensory details are immersive and integral to the story's mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strengths: Powerful central symbolism (amber as archive, not absolution); potent imagery throughout. Weaknesses: Relentlessly dense figurative language occasionally feels overwrought, risking style over substance in moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strengths: Unique synthesis of elements (mercenary, mystical amber, street art). Weaknesses: Core redemption arc is a familiar trope; some phrases ("gunfire rewrote his résumé") lean towards common parlance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strengths: High degree of creativity in blending disparate elements; strong thematic core regarding memory and peace. Weaknesses: Narrative conveniences in the plot slightly undermine the otherwise compelling and richly described setup.</comment>
