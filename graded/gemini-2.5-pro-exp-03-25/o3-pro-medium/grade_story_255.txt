<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The central decryption method is highly original, yet some surrounding elements (seer, relic) are familiar tropes, and certain phrases ("analytically innovative patience") are awkward.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Creatively combines disparate elements into a cohesive narrative, but minor plot contrivances and occasional stylistic overreach prevent it from achieving flawless execution.</comment>
