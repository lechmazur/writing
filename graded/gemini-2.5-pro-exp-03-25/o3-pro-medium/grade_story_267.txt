<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and unique, but the 'mild-tempered' trait feels underdeveloped against his philosophical depth; the disguise is more symbolic than plot-functional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Clear arc and good pacing, but the bike-bell resolution is symbolically apt yet mechanically unconvincing for the established physical crisis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Highly imaginative setting with excellent juxtapositions, though the 'savage bliss' aspect of the atmosphere is more asserted than fully rendered in the prose.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Inventive and thematically resonant, creating a memorable world, but held back from flawlessness by a narratively convenient resolution and some underutilized elements.</comment>
