<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are superficially clear but lack nuanced development; the crucial alliance forms through narrative convenience (told backstory) rather than earned interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The plot is complete but relies on whimsical (fortune cookie) and contrived (sudden backstory) devices for key developments, undermining its literary seriousness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Ambitious craft is marred by a lack of subtlety, an overabundance of ornate figurative language, and explicitly stated themes, feeling "overwritten."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The original premise is undermined by a consistently overwrought prose style and narrative shortcuts (e.g., the festival backstory) that feel artificial and detract from emotional authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>While the core concept and setting are creative, the overall execution, particularly the self-conscious prose and unconvincing development of the central relationship, falls well short of top-tier publishability.</comment>
