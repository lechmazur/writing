<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong voice and clear motivation, but the "smiling saboteur" epithet is introduced somewhat overtly, feeling more stated than earned through emergent action alone.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Coherent arc and effective pacing for its length, though the central mechanism (mannequin communication for stellar events) relies on a highly whimsical premise requiring significant suspension of disbelief.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exceptionally vivid and atmospheric setting that perfectly complements the themes of decay and unconventional power, a significant strength of the piece.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rich in literary devices and thematic depth, but the prose is relentlessly intense, and some emotional states (e.g., "angry peace surged in me") are declared rather than purely shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Highly original concept and execution, yet the dense, ornate prose frequently borders on "purple," potentially sacrificing nuanced delivery for stylistic flourish at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements are impressively integrated into a creative narrative, though its thematic self-awareness can feel slightly overdetermined, making the resolution almost too perfectly aligned with the premise.</comment>
