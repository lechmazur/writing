<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The 'sleep-deprived inventor' is functionally integrated, and motivation is clear; however, Nemo remains more a symbolic conduit for the story's conceptual framework than a deeply nuanced individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear and effectively driven by the core action, but the specific mechanism of transformation (DNA-based orchard recoding) stretches credulity even for speculative fiction, relying heavily on thematic metaphor rather than plausible internal logic.</comment>
