<question>1</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>The "assertively meek" attribute is stated rather than seamlessly shown, and the first-person voice feels more authorially sophisticated than distinctly the character's.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Plot achieves a full arc, but the rapid introduction of elements (drones, tapestry's full power) feels slightly convenient within the condensed narrative, straining elegant causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The mirage oasis and oppressive tech-labyrinth are vividly rendered, creating a strong, supportive atmosphere; sensory details are a highlight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Rich in literary devices and unique ideas, but the thematic message ("meek voices can rewrite its code") is somewhat explicitly stated at the end, and the sheer density of figurative language occasionally risks feeling overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>While the core rebellious method is original, the prose frequently employs highly ornate metaphors and descriptions that, while often striking, can feel authorially imposed and border on "fine writing," detracting from organic character voice or narrative flow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Elements are creatively integrated, but the extremely dense and self-consciously literary prose style, while ambitious, hinders overall clarity and flow, feeling more like a compression of larger ideas than a piece perfectly suited to its brief length.</comment>
