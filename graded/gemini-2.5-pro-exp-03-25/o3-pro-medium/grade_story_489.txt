<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrator's voice is distinct and motivation clear, but the "unseen" attribute feels more like a thematic label than a deeply explored aspect of character; Serafina is impactful but necessarily sketched.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc and climax, but the central magical causality (dancer-whale-whistle) relies on poetic assertion rather than a more subtly established internal logic, which may strain credulity even for magical realism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world and atmosphere are exceptionally realized; specific, evocative sensory details create a powerful, immersive, and thematically resonant haunted lighthouse setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves considerable impact through its unique premise and striking literary devices; however, the sheer density of figurative language, while often beautiful, borders on overwhelming for such a brief piece.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative demonstrates significant originality in its blending of elements and possesses a distinct authorial voice; metaphors are generally fresh, though the heightened poetic style is so consistent it almost becomes a new kind of formalism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story creatively integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive and thematically resonant whole, leaving a lingering impression; its primary vulnerability lies in the asserted nature of its fantastical mechanics rather than a more organic unfolding.</comment>
