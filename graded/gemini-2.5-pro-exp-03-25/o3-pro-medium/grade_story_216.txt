<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strength: Distinct, compelling narrative voice and clear motivation. Weakness: Character remains somewhat archetypal, defined more by role than deep personal nuance beyond the survival imperative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strength: Coherent, inventive plot with a satisfying resolution within the constraints. Weakness: The antagonist ("velvet voice") is an undeveloped plot device, limiting conflict depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strength: Exceptionally vivid, immersive world-building; Cloud City is a tangible, atmospheric presence. Weakness: Minimal; perhaps leans on some familiar "cloud city" visual tropes, though executed well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strength: Evocative imagery and strong thematic resonance. Weakness: Consistently dense metaphorical prose occasionally risks feeling overworked, sacrificing some flow for stylistic effect.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strength: Genuinely original central concept and a distinct, non-formulaic narrative voice with fresh metaphors. Weakness: The pervasive stylistic intensity, while individual, could be perceived as a sustained affectation if not perfectly modulated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strength: Impressive cohesion of disparate elements into a singular, memorable narrative. Weakness: The story's high stylistic ambition means any perceived imperfection in its dense prose is magnified.</comment>
