<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "jumpy" attribute remains superficial, failing to generate meaningful internal conflict or significantly influence Rictor's methodology beyond cursory mentions; his established competence largely negates it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot's resolution, relying on the sudden intervention of "old gods" via a metaphorical RAM ransom, feels overly convenient and diminishes the impact of the protagonist's preceding struggles within the compressed timeframe.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The inventive synthesis of retro-gaming aesthetics and necromantic lore crafts a uniquely compelling and consistent atmosphere; this is a clear strength.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The narrative is overburdened by a relentless density of specialized jargon and figurative language, which often prioritizes stylistic flourish over subtler narrative development or emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the core cyber-necromancy concept is highly original, the stylistic execution, with its unvarying intensity of tech-specific imagery, borders on a mannered affectation rather than sustained, organic invention.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story attempts to pack too much—thematic ambition, stylistic flair, and numerous plot elements—into a very small space, resulting in a compressed and somewhat breathless experience that ultimately lacks the polish required for top-tier publication.</comment>
