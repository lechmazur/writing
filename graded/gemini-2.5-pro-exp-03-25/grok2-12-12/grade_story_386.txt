<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is stated but lacks demonstration; attributes like 'trustworthy strange' are asserted, not shown. Elara remains a sketch, defined by abstract concepts rather than nuanced action or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Plot is minimal, more a mood piece. The assigned action 'catapult' is only used metaphorically, failing to drive events. The structure lacks tension or significant development within the word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The setting and tone offer potential ('atom-powered lighthouse', 'borrowed dawn'), but lack specific sensory details and deeper integration. The 'line that never moves' timeframe is evocative but functionally inert.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Relies heavily on telling emotions and significance ("felt solace," "understood that her journey...") rather than showing. Uses symbolism (tablecloth) but overall impact is muted by passive narration and underdeveloped conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Contains formulaic phrasing ("sentinel against," "celestial dance") and relies on stated, generic emotions. The combination of elements feels somewhat arbitrary, lacking deep originality or subversion of tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elements feel somewhat forced together rather than organically serving a compelling narrative. The story lacks a strong narrative drive or unique insight, feeling more like an atmospheric exercise than a fully realised piece.</comment>
