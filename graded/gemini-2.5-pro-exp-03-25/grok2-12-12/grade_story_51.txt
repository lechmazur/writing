<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character attributes ("apologetic thug," "rationally subjective") are stated rather than demonstrated through action or nuanced voice; motivation is clear but generic, and the transformation lacks depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The plot arc is present but relies heavily on convenient exposition and dialogue rather than driven action; the "staging meetings" method feels disconnected from the core scene and resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The "static electricity garden" setting is conceptually interesting but lacks sufficient sensory detail and integration to feel immersive or essential; its symbolic connection is overt but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Heavy reliance on telling emotions ("felt hope," "felt a shift") instead of showing; dialogue is largely expository, and the resolution feels unearned and abrupt, lacking significant subtext or lingering impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a predictable therapeutic epiphany template; language and emotional descriptions ("weight lifting," "surge of hope") feel generic, lacking a unique voice or fresh perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The assigned elements feel somewhat superficially stitched together rather than emerging organically; the story struggles to transcend its constraints, resulting in a piece that feels competent but ultimately formulaic and lacking distinction.</comment>
