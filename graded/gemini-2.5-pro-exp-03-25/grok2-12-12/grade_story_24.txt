<question>1</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Motivation stated but character feels thin; actions (show in bookstore) contradict established method ("seedy bars"); "ordinarily extraordinary" attribute is asserted, not shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Basic arc exists, but coherence damaged by unexplained timeframe and contradiction between stated method (seedy bars) and actual performance setting (bookstore).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Setting potential unrealized; timeframe element feels entirely extraneous and disconnected; stated tone ("fractured idyll") not effectively evoked through atmosphere or detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Relies heavily on telling instead of showing ("radiating warmth," "stir hearts"); repetitive phrasing undermines impact; symbolism is overt and lacks nuance; theme stated rather than explored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Significant repetition of key phrases ("radiating warmth," "stir hearts grown cold," "ordinarily extraordinary") feels robotic; timeframe element is illogical and ignored; reliance on stated emotion suggests formulaic origin.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Elements feel awkwardly stitched together rather than synergistic, particularly the timeframe and method; repetitive language detracts; the story serves the elements rather than the elements serving a compelling narrative.</comment>
