<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character attributes ("spirited lumberjack," "gracefully awkward") feel superficially applied rather than deeply integrated into actions or voice; motivation shifts slightly and lacks consistent grounding in the established traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc but suffers from underdeveloped cause-and-effect (especially regarding the nightmares) and relies heavily on telling; the integration of "hidden agendas" is weak and feels forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The ossuary restaurant setting is striking and provides a key interaction point, but its connection to the broader world (lumberjack, village, bike rides) feels tenuous; the "harsh tenderness" tone is stated more than evoked.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story lacks significant emotional resonance or subtext due to excessive telling over showing; while the premise is intriguing, the craft is functional rather than literary, and the ending feels abrupt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Relies on stating emotions and uses somewhat repetitive, slightly awkward phrasing ("gracefully awkward," "harsh tenderness"); the combination of elements is original, but the narrative progression feels formulaic and lacks nuanced character reasoning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story struggles under the weight of incorporating numerous disparate elements, leading to a lack of depth and cohesion; the elements often feel like constraints dictating the plot rather than organic components serving a unified vision.</comment>
