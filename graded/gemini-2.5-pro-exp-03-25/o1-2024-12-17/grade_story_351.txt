<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear but character traits like "dreamy" are underdeveloped and "rebellious" lacks nuanced demonstration beyond stated poetic choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot coherence exists but relies heavily on internal realization triggered by the letter; the "riddle" starting point feels arbitrary and disconnected from the core narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric setting effectively enhances theme and mood, but the assigned timeframe ("after the last riddle") is poorly integrated and feels irrelevant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Attempts thematic depth and symbolism (sundial, station), but execution is hampered by overly ornate language ("delicate undoing") and stating themes/emotions too directly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Suffers from repetitive phrasing ("delicate undoing," "unremembered," "formally rebellious") and elevated language that feels artificial rather than authentic or original.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While atmospheric, the story feels constructed around the assigned elements rather than flowing organically; stylistic choices sometimes obscure meaning or feel forced.</comment>
