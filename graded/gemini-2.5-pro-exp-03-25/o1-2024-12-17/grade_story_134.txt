<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character's core attribute ('obnoxiously polite') is weakly demonstrated (more polite than obnoxious), and the 'understudy' status feels irrelevant. Stated motivations ('hinder', 'track cultural evolution') are poorly connected to the immediate actions ('waking the unheard').</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot lacks a clear arc or resolution within the word count, feeling like an opening scene. The assigned action ('hinder') and method ('eavesdropping on oak grove') are stated but disconnected from the central activity depicted in the salt chamber, weakening coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The setting is unique and visually interesting, contributing some atmosphere. However, the 'laundry cycles' timeframe feels somewhat superficially integrated, and the 'playful dread' tone is inconsistent, leaning more towards cautious anticipation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story presents an intriguing concept (polite magic, mundane/arcane mix) and some evocative imagery, but suffers from an unsatisfying, unresolved ending and occasionally overwrought prose. The central conflict remains potential rather than actualized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the juxtaposition of elements offers some originality, the piece relies on familiar fantasy tropes and occasionally stilted or overly descriptive phrasing ("absurdly courteous"). Emotional states are often stated rather than shown, lacking nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak due to the disconnect between stated motivations/methods and the depicted actions. Several assigned elements feel awkwardly incorporated rather than organically driving the narrative, resulting in a fragmented feel rather than a complete micro-story.</comment>
