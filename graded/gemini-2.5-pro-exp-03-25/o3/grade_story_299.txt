<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation drives action, but character attributes ("unsure champion," "rationally rebellious") feel somewhat explicitly labeled rather than emerging purely organically from action and thought.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Generally strong arc and pacing within the word limit, but the core action 'underpin' is addressed indirectly through its intended purpose, slightly lessening its immediate plot impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative setting effectively uses sensory details (especially sound via the bells), but the assigned tone ("cheerful gloom"), while present, relies partly on explicit statement rather than solely on atmospheric creation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Thoughtful use of symbolism (brooch, paths) and thematic depth, with a satisfying alternative resolution, though overall impact could be heightened with more nuanced interaction or dialogue.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Largely avoids formulaic pitfalls with some fresh metaphors ("bottled sunsets"), but occasional phrasing feels overly ornate ("ossify into sterile iconography"), bordering on self-conscious literariness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Achieves good cohesion and integrates elements creatively into a narrative that feels purposeful and leaves a lingering thematic resonance, though minor stylistic choices slightly detract from flawless execution.</comment>
