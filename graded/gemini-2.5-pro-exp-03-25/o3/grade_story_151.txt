<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Cress's motivation shifts abruptly upon finding the veil, making the initial 'rationally organic' approach feel somewhat underdeveloped. The 'awed' descriptor slightly jars with the 'post-emotion' setting, lacking sufficient exploration of this internal contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, but the initial method (snowflakes/moral dilemmas) is superseded rapidly by the veil/emotion plot, making the transition feel slightly disjointed. The resolution, while impactful, feels somewhat rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting, timeframe, and tone ("crystal shadows") are exceptionally well-integrated, creating a potent atmosphere that strongly supports the narrative. Sensory details effectively immerse the reader in this unique, cold world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolic weight and evocative imagery (veil as lens, ice gongs, incandescent fruit) create significant impact. The central theme of overcoming fear to restore feeling is clear and resonant, though the prose occasionally borders on overly dense.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept and execution feel original, avoiding common tropes. While the language is elevated and generally fresh, certain phrases ("rationally organic discipline") feel slightly abstract or overly constructed, hinting at artificiality rather than pure authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates impressive cohesion, weaving most assigned elements into a resonant narrative. The brevity feels purposeful, focusing the impact, and the creative synthesis of disparate concepts (astronomy, botany, emotion, ice) is a significant strength.</comment>
