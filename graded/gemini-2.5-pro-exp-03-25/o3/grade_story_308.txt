<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong core concept (bashful executioner), but the internal shift from trembling fear to confident performer feels slightly abrupt and overly reliant on the external catalyst (Mother Pearl), lacking deeper exploration within the tight space.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear structure with a beginning, middle, and resolution fitting the word count; however, the central conflict's resolution feels somewhat convenient and perhaps too easily achieved.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Evocative setting (floating studio, festival) and atmosphere strongly support the central concept ("soothing tides") and character arc, using sensory details effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (tides, keychain) and imagery creates impact, but some specific phrasing ("sincerely rare") feels slightly mannered, slightly detracting from the overall craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Highly original premise combining disparate elements (executioner, yoga, dance) successfully avoids major clich√©s and offers a fresh perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Impressive cohesion and thematic resonance achieved within the word limit through skillful integration of the assigned elements; the story feels purposeful and complete.</comment>
