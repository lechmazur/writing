<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character depth is insufficient for this level. Maelion's 'distrustful' nature is superficial, and Tilda serves primarily as a catalyst. The repeated use of 'rebelliously docile' feels contrived rather than insightful.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc, but the resolution hinges on the journeymen's abrupt change of heart, which feels unearned and overly convenient, undermining coherence and pacing at the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere and setting are vividly rendered (soot, ash). However, the 'seashell method' feels arbitrary and lacks convincing integration into the established world logic, slightly weakening the overall immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates competent craft with effective symbolism (candlestick, emblem). However, the impact is diminished by a rushed and simplistic resolution, preventing deeper thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While the core concept blends disparate elements originally, execution suffers from minor repetitive phrasing ('rebelliously docile') and a predictable, convenient resolution arc. The seashell method feels like an artificial graft.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion, but the integration of certain elements (specifically the seashell method) feels less organic than others. The narrative potential is capped by the overly tidy ending.</comment>
