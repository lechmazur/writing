<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrator's voice and internal conflict are well-defined and consistent, evolving believably. Emil is effectively sketched, though slightly less dimensional than the narrator, serving more as a catalyst.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot structure is efficient and coherent within the word limit, achieving a clear arc. The chance encounter effectively initiates the core conflict/connection, leading to a satisfying, albeit swift, resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is exceptionally strong, blending the specific sensory details of the archive (moss, ozone, hiss) and Emil's world (yeast, copper) effectively. The post-AI timeframe adds a subtle, resonant layer.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High level of craft evident in evocative imagery (moth/projector light, thunder/heartbeat), strong symbolism (lion knocker), and resonant themes (human connection vs. data, sensory experience). The ending achieves satisfying emotional depth and subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prose feels original and avoids clich√©s; metaphors are fresh and specific. The handling of emotion is nuanced, shown through the narrator's internal shift rather than stated outright. Distinct voice and style.</comment>
