<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Orrin's assigned attributes ("morbid florist," "neutrally passionate") feel more like labels than deeply integrated character traits driving nuanced action. While his actions align with the plot, the connection between his floristry and the task (astral maintenance) is tenuous, and "neutrally passionate" somewhat mutes potential emotional depth, making his motivation feel intellectual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent with a clear arc (problem, task, symbolic resolution) within the word limit. However, the resolution (burning a page steadies the orbit) relies heavily on symbolism, lacking concrete mechanics which might feel slightly unearned or convenient, even within a fantastical setting. Pacing is efficient but borders on rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The setting ("floating rock dojo") and timeframe ("last flicker...") are vividly realised and work synergistically to create a strong, mystical atmosphere. Sensory details are present, though some descriptions ("bonsai boulders practiced silent katas") lean towards stylistic flourish over functional world-building. The atmosphere strongly supports the story's themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong craft through evocative imagery and symbolism (candle, petals, smoke calligraphy). It successfully explores themes of decay and renewal. However, the impact is slightly lessened by the protagonist's detached ("neutrally passionate") nature, and the theme's articulation feels somewhat explicit in the final paragraphs rather than purely emergent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The core concept and setting offer originality. However, certain phrases ("neutrally passionate," "boldly timid," "clarified grief") feel overly conceptual or stylized, bordering on artificiality or purple prose. While avoiding major clich√©s, the execution doesn't entirely escape a sense of curated aesthetic over organic narrative flow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion despite incorporating numerous specific elements, demonstrating creative integration. The brevity feels intentional, fitting a vignette style. However, the elements occasionally feel more like constraints being dutifully met than components arising organically from the narrative's core needs, slightly hindering flawless execution.</comment>
