<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character possesses a distinct and consistent voice ("grandiose modesty"), but the motivation (collecting songs via real estate deals) feels somewhat whimsical and lacks deeper exploration or grounding within this brief piece.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is clear and achieves a sense of completeness, effectively using the core method to drive events; however, the abstract nature of the clients (lighthouse, lullaby) slightly strains narrative coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The imaginative setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered and strongly support the story's unique tone and concept, using specific details effectively (static cups, humming planks).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong craft through unique imagery and perspective, but the central conflict is very low-stakes, and the prose occasionally borders on overly ornate ("purple prose"), slightly diminishing its impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High degree of originality in concept and execution, successfully avoiding common tropes and establishing a unique narrative voice; the freshness of the core idea is its greatest strength.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves impressive cohesion, creatively integrating the disparate assigned elements into a unified and memorable vignette that feels deliberate rather than constrained by requirements.</comment>
