<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's voice is distinct and the motivation (stepping out of shadow) is clear, driving the narrative. However, the 'wreck-diver' aspect feels somewhat superficially integrated into this specific scene, primarily serving as a backstory for the amber rather than deeply influencing immediate actions or personality beyond a general affinity for the past/depths.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure is tight and coherent within the word limit, achieving a clear arc from setup to resolution. The core action ('arouse') effectively drives events. Pacing is well-managed. The 'thawing heart' concept provides a symbolic climax, though its literal manifestation feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Excellent atmospheric creation through strong sensory details (brine, burnt sugar, salt-soft murmurs) and evocative descriptions. The abandoned carnival setting is used effectively to enhance the melancholic tone and the ghost-whispering action. Setting, object, and atmosphere are meaningfully interwoven.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High level of craft with effective use of imagery, symbolism (amber, letter, thawing targets), and evocative language. The story successfully evokes emotion and presents a clear theme of confronting lineage to find personal freedom. The ending provides satisfying symbolic closure. Shows strong command of 'show, don't tell'.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is largely fresh and avoids obvious clich√©s, demonstrating an individual style. Metaphors are generally specific and effective. While the emotional arc is handled with nuance, some phrasing ("stitched past and present," "constellations of regret") leans towards familiar literary tropes. Overall, it feels more authored than formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story achieves strong cohesion, skillfully integrating most assigned elements in service of the narrative. The brief length feels purposeful, focusing on a potent moment of transition. It demonstrates creative synthesis and leaves a lingering emotional resonance, suggesting depth beyond the surface plot.</comment>
