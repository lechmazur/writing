<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrator's 'dry-witted sentinel' voice is established initially but isn't consistently maintained or deeply explored. Mara's motivation is clear but functional; she feels more like a catalyst for the ritual than a fully realized character. Their interaction lacks nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot structure provides a clear arc (watch -> trial -> succession) within the word limit. However, the central mechanism (Fathom Waltz leading to spectral judgement and rope repair) feels somewhat abrupt and relies heavily on fantastical convenience rather than tightly woven internal logic. Pacing accelerates rapidly at the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's strongest point. The haunted lighthouse setting is vividly rendered with effective sensory details (dust beams, briny violins, phosphorescent mold), strongly supporting the tone and concept of arrested time and lingering presence. The timeframe enhances the haunted mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong craft through evocative imagery and symbolism (rope, dance). The central conflict resolves neatly, perhaps too neatly. While possessing atmosphere, it lacks profound subtext or emotional resonance beyond the surface narrative of succession. The theme of acknowledging scars is present but not deeply explored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the 'Fathom Waltz' concept offers originality, the overall narrative incorporates familiar tropes (haunted lighthouse, spectral guardians, passing the torch) without significant subversion. Some phrasing ("surgical beams," "winter dandruff") borders on clich√©. The writing style is competent but doesn't feel exceptionally unique or stylistically groundbreaking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative, particularly the setting, object, and method. However, some elements (like the attribute 'certainly possible') feel slightly forced. The brief length works for the focused scene, but the overall piece feels like a well-executed vignette rather than a story with truly exceptional depth or originality demanding immediate top-tier publication.</comment>
