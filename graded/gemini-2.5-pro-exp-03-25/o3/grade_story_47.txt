<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "eagerly jaded" attribute provides an interesting starting point, but the "dutiful ward" aspect feels somewhat superficial after the initial setup. Motivation shifts plausibly towards solving the mystery, driven by his past, but the connection between his initial duties and the final act could be stronger.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is commendably tight and achieves a clear arc within the word limit. The 'solve' action drives the narrative effectively. However, the discovery of the second phone and the precise geometric solution feel slightly convenient, a common concession in compressed narratives.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Excellent atmospheric creation, leveraging the "soundless sanctuary" setting against the intrusion of technology and eventual laughter. Sensory details are generally evocative, effectively grounding the action and enhancing the "reframing the familiar" concept. The crypt scene is particularly strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High degree of craft. Strong use of metaphor ("relic-wrapped microphone", "digital confetti") and symbolism. The story successfully evokes curiosity and delivers a satisfying, thematically resonant ending. The central theme of confronting mortality with humor ("graceless beauty") is well-developed and impactful. Shows effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Largely original concept and execution, blending disparate elements (sacred space, tech-mystery, dark comedy) effectively. Language is fresh, avoiding obvious clichés. While some phrasing borders on ornate ("lúrched awake"), it generally contributes to a distinct style rather than feeling generically AI-generated or purple.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates impressive cohesion, integrating the required elements into a unique and compelling narrative rather than feeling constrained by them. The brevity feels purposeful, focusing the impact. It leaves the reader with a lingering sense of transformation and thematic depth.</comment>
