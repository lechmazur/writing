<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mira's 'reserved' and 'humbly proud' traits are adequately portrayed through her quiet actions and satisfaction, but the 'oracle' designation feels entirely unearned and superficial, lacking any demonstration beyond cataloging sounds. Dal is functional but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot structure is commendably tight for the word count, with a clear arc driven by the 'mend' action. However, the mechanism for revealing the instructions (choir vibrations loosening wallpaper precisely when needed) feels overly convenient, slightly undermining the otherwise logical coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The 'laboratory of lost sounds' setting is highly evocative and synergizes effectively with the choir practice timeframe, creating a rich auditory backdrop. Sensory details are well-employed, establishing a distinct, fitting atmosphere that supports the preservation theme and Mira's secretive actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (ripple effect, mending) and resonant imagery elevates the narrative beyond its simple plot. The theme of quiet legacy and preservation is effectively conveyed, leaving a thoughtful impact. The central conflict provides sufficient tension for the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The core concept combination (sound archiving, solfege embroidery) is original. However, some phrasing ("reverse resonance," "test tubes of silence") borders on overly stylized or pseudo-profound, and the 'oracle' element feels like a generic label rather than an organic trait.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive and atmospheric whole, using the constraints to create a focused narrative. The piece demonstrates creative synthesis, leaving a lingering sense of quiet purpose and the power of unseen actions.</comment>
