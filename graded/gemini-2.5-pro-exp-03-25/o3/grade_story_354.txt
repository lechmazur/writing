<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation ("chase aurora patterns") feels slightly misaligned with the primary action (healing them driven by "daring compassion"); the "wizard" aspect feels underdeveloped within the digital context.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically from seeking a passkey to reaching and interacting with the auroras, achieving a compact arc; however, the resolution feels somewhat abrupt given the setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric creation through evocative descriptions ("glass lung," "prismatic clicks") effectively merging the digital setting ("virtual reality archive") with the ethereal tone; "between load cycles" adds temporal texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Impressive use of metaphor and imagery ("iron orchids," "spectral tapestries") creates impact, but the theme of valuing excised emotions could be explored with more narrative depth beyond the surface action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While possessing unique imagery, the consistently ornate language ("radiant equations," "prismatic clicks") and somewhat predictable arc (find key -> overcome obstacle -> fix problem) lean towards stylized formula rather than deep originality or nuanced emotion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates disparate elements into a cohesive, imaginative whole, demonstrating creative thinking, though the style occasionally prioritizes flourish over narrative clarity or emotional resonance.</comment>
