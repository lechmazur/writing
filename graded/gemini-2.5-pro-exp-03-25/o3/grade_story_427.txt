<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character concept (dueling philosopher) feels somewhat superficial, more a label than deeply integrated; motivation is clear but lacks profound nuance beyond the stated goal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot achieves a basic arc but relies on convenient tropes (secret under duress) and somewhat forced philosophical framing (Virel's deconstructed pistol).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric setting (lighthouse), but some symbolic elements (the sock) feel contrived and detract slightly from the otherwise effective mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overuse of explicit, often heavy-handed metaphors and somewhat purple prose ("metallic applause," "stones shifting equilibria") undermines potential impact; lacks subtlety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the core concept has some originality, the execution relies on overly elaborate language and dense, sometimes generic, metaphors, lacking a truly distinct voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Integration of elements feels effortful rather than organic; the story struggles under the weight of its conceptual baggage and self-conscious stylistic choices.</comment>
