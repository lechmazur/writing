<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The locksmith attribute feels more like an applied metaphor ("unlocking memories," "precision") than a deeply integrated aspect of character action or background, weakening its impact. Motivation is clear and consistent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of symbolic culmination ("final leaf") within the word limit, but the pacing feels compressed, trying to contain a large concept. The metaphysical elements allow coherence, though conventional logic is suspended.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The "physically metaphysical" attribute is brilliantly realized in the floating orchard setting, creating a unique and evocative atmosphere that strongly supports the theme and character's mission. Sensory details enhance the surreal mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (orchard, trees, leaf, map) and evocative imagery creates significant impact and subtext regarding cultural erasure and resilience. The central conflict is clear and the theme resonates effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The core concept is highly original, but the prose occasionally borders on overly ornate ("pregnant with untold narratives," "jaded wonder propelled her forward"), slightly diminishing authenticity. Metaphors are generally fresh but dense.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates disparate elements into a cohesive, albeit dense, whole. The brevity feels appropriate for a symbolic, atmospheric piece, leaving a lingering sense of wonder and resilience.</comment>
