<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and tied well to the handkerchief. Marco, however, feels underdeveloped; his 'aimless traveler' description contradicts his focused mission and 'factual precision', and the 'factually imaginative' attribute is asserted rather than demonstrated effectively through action or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The 'grill' action drives the central scene, but the 'hopscotch board' method feels abstract and metaphorically forced, lacking practical coherence with the grilling or recipe preservation. The plot achieves a basic arc, but the connection between the board's patterns and the culinary journey remains conceptually thin and slightly contrived within the short form.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The archive setting strongly supports the theme of preservation. Sensory details like woodsmoke and cooking aromas are effective. However, the specific timeframe 'as a snowflake melts on warm skin' feels jarringly out of place in a remote Peruvian mountain setting without further context, weakening the atmospheric coherence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism (handkerchief, board, food) effectively and establishes a clear theme of cultural resistance. However, the emotional impact is sometimes hampered by directly stating complex feelings ("mournful elation") rather than purely showing them. The writing style is ambitious but occasionally overwrought ("momentary crystalline memory").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>While the premise is somewhat original, certain phrases ("factual precision and imaginative resonance," "archaeologists of taste," "mournful elation") feel overly constructed and lack organic nuance, bordering on purple prose or AI-like formality. The hopscotch board concept, while unique, feels slightly gimmicky and its logic isn't seamlessly integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story attempts cohesion, successfully linking the archive, handkerchief, and grilling to the preservation theme. However, the integration of Marco's characterization, the hopscotch board's function, and the snowflake timeframe feels less organic, suggesting the elements were sometimes forced into the narrative rather than emerging naturally from it.</comment>
