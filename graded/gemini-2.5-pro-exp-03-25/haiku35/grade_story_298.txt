<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The 'rationally impulsive' attribute is stated but not convincingly demonstrated within the narrative action; it remains an assertion rather than an observed character trait derived from behaviour.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The plot is largely static, describing a state or moment rather than a progression; the 'solving cold-case mysteries' method feels like expositional backstory, disconnected from the immediate action of 'reproducing' the narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The post-oil future and ancient palace setting create an intriguing juxtaposition, but the 'sunlight through debris' concept feels like a superficial visual detail rather than deeply integrated atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While possessing strong imagery (chameleonic skin) and an interesting central idea, the impact is lessened by slightly overwrought phrasing ("living holographic projection") and a reliance on describing the performance's intent rather than fully evoking its effect.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The core concept is original, but the execution includes some potentially formulaic descriptions ("delicate ecosystem," "narrative brushstroke") and states character traits/motivations rather than revealing them through nuanced action or subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story presents a compelling core idea but struggles with cohesion; certain elements (Attribute, Method) feel superficially incorporated rather than organically driving the narrative, making it feel more like a concept sketch than a fully realized piece.</comment>
