<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character traits like "arrogant" and "doubtfully confident" are stated rather than convincingly demonstrated through action or nuanced internal thought; the motivation is clear but abstract, lacking concrete grounding in the immediate scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The plot structure is weak; the core "action" (authorize) is vague and internal, and its connection to the assigned "method" (wedding song) is illogical and forced, undermining coherence despite a clear beginning/middle/end arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The setting and object are well-integrated, creating a strong atmosphere that supports the theme of tradition; however, the "between breaths" timeframe isn't fully realized in the pacing, and the assigned "harsh tenderness" tone feels inconsistently applied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (tapestry) and establishes a clear internal conflict and theme, but relies too heavily on telling emotions and character traits; the ending offers thematic resolution but lacks strong narrative impact due to the abstract nature of the action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>While aiming for literary quality, the prose occasionally dips into clich√© ("whispered ancient secrets") and overly ornate phrasing; emotions are often stated directly, and the core conflict relies on the familiar trope of a warrior constrained by tradition without significant subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story struggles to cohesively integrate all assigned elements, particularly the method (song) and action (authorize), making them feel imposed; while atmospheric, the narrative lacks the sharpness and originality expected for top-tier publication.</comment>
