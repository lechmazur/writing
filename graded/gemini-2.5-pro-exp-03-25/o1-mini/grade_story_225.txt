<question>1</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Character attributes ("wayward apothecary," "unjustly fair") are stated but not integrated into behaviour or motivation convincingly. The butterfly motivation feels disconnected from the apothecary background and the core action. Voice is indistinct; lacks depth beyond surface descriptions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot is minimal, essentially a single scene of communication. While the method (Morse code) fits, the core action ("infect" with hope) is thematic rather than plot-driving. The story lacks a clear arc or development within the word count, feeling static despite the emotional intent. Coherence suffers from underdeveloped connections between elements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting is vividly evoked with good sensory details (gears, steam, brass) and works well with the "battered marvel" tone and clandestine communication. However, the connection between the setting and the character's core traits (apothecary) or the object (highlighter) is tenuous or non-existent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story attempts emotional impact and uses symbolism (butterflies, pen), but relies heavily on stating emotions ("heart swelled") rather than showing them. The central theme of unconventional love is clear, but the execution lacks subtlety and subtext. The writing style is somewhat overwrought, hindering genuine impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Shows signs of formulaic writing: repetitive phrasing ("battered marvel," "unconventional love"), somewhat generic emotional descriptions, and a combination of disparate elements (steampunk, apothecary, butterflies, highlighter) that feels forced rather than organic. Language leans towards ornate without sufficient justification. Lacks a unique authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Cohesion is weak; the assigned elements feel more like a checklist than parts of an integrated whole. The story seems constructed *around* the elements rather than using them naturally. While atmospheric, the narrative lacks depth and the disparate parts fail to coalesce into a truly compelling or resonant piece.</comment>
