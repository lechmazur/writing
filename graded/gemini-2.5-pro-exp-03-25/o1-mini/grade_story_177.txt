<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (restoring art) and attribute (rebellious) are stated but weakly demonstrated through action. The unique profession (obituaries for the living) feels underdeveloped, serving more as flavour text than a core driver. The mask interaction is present but doesn't reveal significant character depth beyond reflecting stated turmoil.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The plot relies heavily on abstract concepts (labyrinth of choices, lucid frenzy) and repetition rather than concrete progression. The connection between the organ resonance manifesting visions and navigating the labyrinth is asserted but lacks clear cause-and-effect logic. The story feels more like a description of a situation than a narrative arc with meaningful development within the word limit; pacing is uneven due to repetitive descriptions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The giant's bookshelf setting is potentially strong but underutilized beyond being a 'labyrinth'. The 'lucid frenzy' tone is declared more than evoked by the prose. The 'rumors of revolution' timeframe feels entirely peripheral, adding little atmospheric weight or consequence. The mask and setting connection is functional but not deeply resonant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Relies heavily on telling ("Rebellion fueled his pen") rather than showing. Symbolism (mask, labyrinth) is overt but lacks subtlety. The central conflict is abstract (navigating choices, restoring art) and lacks tangible stakes or resolution beyond a declared triumph. The theme of artistic rebellion is present but handled superficially. Impact is limited by abstract language and underdeveloped core concepts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Significant repetition of key phrases ("labyrinth of choices," "rebellious," "lucid frenzy," "resonance," "mask") suggests formulaic construction. Sensory details are sparse and often generic. Emotion is stated ("inner turmoil") rather than shown. The combination of elements feels forced, lacking the nuance and organic flow expected of original fiction; leans towards purple prose ("delicate dance," "melodies of resistance").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The story struggles under the weight of its numerous assigned abstract elements, feeling more like an exercise in incorporating keywords than a cohesive narrative. The elements often dictate the story rather than serving it. Clarity is hampered by abstract language and repetition. The brevity feels like a constraint that prevented deeper exploration rather than a deliberate stylistic choice.</comment>
