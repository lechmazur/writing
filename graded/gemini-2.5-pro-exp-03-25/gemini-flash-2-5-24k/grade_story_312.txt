<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear, but the portrayal of agoraphobia lacks depth and feels primarily functional for the plot rather than a deeply explored condition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is sound for the length, but relies on convenient exposition (discovery via notes, pact details) rather than organic discovery or subtle implication.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is adequately established, effectively linking confinement and external threat, but the setting elements (dunes, city lights) lack sharp, memorable detail beyond their functional role.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Relies too heavily on telling the significance (pact's meaning, character's feelings like 'eager resignation') rather than showing it through nuanced action or subtext; lacks profound impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Prose is competent but generic; lacks a distinctive authorial voice and fails to elevate familiar tropes (ancient pact, magic heirloom) beyond their basic function.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Integrates assigned elements adequately, but the result feels somewhat mechanical, constrained by the inputs rather than transcending them into something truly original or resonant.</comment>
