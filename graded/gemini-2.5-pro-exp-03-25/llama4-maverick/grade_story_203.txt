<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivation ("inheritance of lies," "sculpt possibility") feels abstract and asserted rather than demonstrated. The stage fright is mentioned but has minimal impact on actions beyond trembling hands, weakening its significance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc (setup, ritual, aftermath) within the word count, but the connection between the exorcism and overcoming the "inheritance of lies" remains tenuous. The "key turning" trigger feels slightly arbitrary. Pacing is adequate but lacks depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The orbital debris setting is evocative and works well with the "never usual" attribute. However, the "toy assembly" timeframe feels jarringly disconnected and unexplained, detracting significantly from atmospheric coherence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>While containing some evocative imagery ("graveyard of steel," "defiant hush"), the story relies heavily on stating emotions and themes ("inheritance of lies," "newfound sense of purpose") rather than showing them through nuanced action or subtext. The central conflict is present but resolved superficially.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The core concept (space exorcist) is original, but the execution employs somewhat generic phrasing ("eyes fixed on the task," "testament to the power") and stated emotions. The combination of disparate elements, especially the toy assembly, feels forced and artificial, lacking organic integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story struggles under the weight of its assigned elements, feeling more like an exercise in inclusion than an organic narrative. The orbital debris setting is strong, but other elements (toy assembly, inheritance of lies) feel underdeveloped or poorly integrated, hindering overall cohesion and impact.</comment>
