<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (mapping patterns) is stated but feels disconnected from the initial actions; the "selfless" trait is asserted, not demonstrated, and the character lacks a distinct voice or nuanced reaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc, but the connection between the record, the hum, and the mapping feels contrived; the "lunge" action lacks clear motivation, and the "mark of trust" concept remains superficial.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "recycled spaceship" setting is generic and underutilized; the "savage grace" tone is stated but not effectively evoked through atmosphere or description, weakening the world's impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Relies heavily on telling ("selfless," "longing," "savage grace") rather than showing; literary devices often feel ornate ("intangibly tangible") rather than impactful, and subtext is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Frequent use of slightly purple, clich√© phrasing ("reverberate through every cell," "otherworldly light," "fabric of space and time") and stated emotions suggests formulaic writing; lacks fresh metaphors and nuanced character reasoning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story feels constructed *around* the assigned elements rather than using them organically; the style prioritizes evocative-sounding language over clarity and genuine depth, hindering overall cohesion and impact.</comment>
