<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The core contradiction (cuddler prejudiced against intimacy) is established, but the motivation to overcome it feels somewhat abstract until Silas appears. The resolution, while present, feels too swift and declarative for a deep-seated prejudice, lacking nuanced portrayal of the internal shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear symbolic arc (inciting incident, confrontation, resolution) within the word limit. However, the 'acceptance speech' framing feels extraneous and disconnected from the core internal journey, weakening overall coherence and the sense of completeness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport hangar setting is evocative and effectively used to create atmosphere ('ancient novelty') and symbolic resonance with forgotten dreams/potential. However, the 'hush before an acceptance speech' timeframe feels poorly integrated and adds little value.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism (phantom punch, hangar) effectively but relies heavily on stating the character's realization ("She realized her prejudice had decayed...") rather than fully showing the transformation through more subtle means. The emotional impact feels muted by this declarative approach.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>While the premise has originality, the execution includes some slightly clich√©d phrasing ("quiet wisdom," "whispering of journeys") and overly neat thematic statements ("prejudice was merely fear disguised as certainty"). The emotional arc resolves too cleanly, lacking the messy nuance of genuine human change.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story attempts to weave disparate elements together, succeeding best with the character's internal conflict, the setting, and the symbolic object. However, elements like the timeframe feel forced, preventing seamless cohesion and suggesting the story is constrained by the elements rather than organically born from them.</comment>
