<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (tragedy), but the character feels like a collection of assigned traits (vigilant, punctual, sardonic) rather than a fully integrated personality. The 'sardonic glee' feels particularly forced and inconsistent with the underlying grief and meticulous nature.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The plot hits the required beats (investigation, discovery, confrontation, resolution) but feels significantly rushed and compressed within the word limit. The conspiracy's unraveling and Marlowe's confession lack dramatic tension due to the rapid pacing and convenient plot points.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The 'paper airplane test facility' setting is intriguing and allows for the unique 'peacock pattern' method, but it lacks vivid sensory detail. The connection between the peacock seal and the peacock code feels overly convenient and symbolic, weakening verisimilitude.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Relies heavily on telling emotions ("felt a bittersweet triumph") rather than showing. Symbolism (peacock, pruning) is present but heavy-handed. The resolution is neat but lacks emotional resonance due to the rushed plot and superficial characterization. The central conflict is resolved too easily.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Shows signs of formulaic writing: noticeable repetition of keywords ('sardonic', 'vigilant', 'punctual', 'peacock'), reliance on standard tropes (grieving investigator, convenient confession), and stated rather than nuanced emotion. The plot progression feels predictable, lacking originality and depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story dutifully incorporates all assigned elements, but the integration feels mechanical rather than organic. The narrative attempts too much for its length, resulting in a superficial treatment of character, plot, and theme. It lacks the subtlety and stylistic distinction required for top-tier publication.</comment>
