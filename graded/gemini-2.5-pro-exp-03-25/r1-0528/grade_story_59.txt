<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "mournful" attribute is powerfully embodied and drives the character's motivation; the "troubadour" aspect, while thematically resonant at the climax, feels less consistently integrated throughout his preceding actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc leading to a powerful resolution; the "demystify" action is central, though the "star trails" method for triggering the chamber relies more on poetic contrivance than strict realism.</comment>
