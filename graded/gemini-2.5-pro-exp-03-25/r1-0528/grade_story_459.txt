<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "elegantly clumsy" attribute is superficial and poorly integrated; the "elevator technician" identity feels like extraneous detail rather than essential to this specific narrative, and his core motivation crystallizes too conveniently and late.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The "ghost tour" method is a narrative red herring for this particular spirit, consuming valuable space without advancing the central ghost's resolution; the plot relies more on an abrupt epiphany than the implied meticulous "dissection."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab setting is strikingly effective, creating a potent atmosphere that beautifully mirrors the story's themes of ephemerality, memory, and delicate preservation; it's the strongest, most evocative element.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story aims for literary depth with its symbolism, but the prose occasionally veers into self-consciousness (e.g., "dissonance of silence," "elegantly clumsy grace"), and the pivotal understanding is declared rather than fully demonstrated or earned through subtle revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>While not overtly mechanical, the narrative relies on the somewhat worn trope of a sensitive man aiding a restless spirit; certain phrases ("elegantly clumsy") feel like prompt fulfillment rather than organic characterization or fresh expression.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story struggles to seamlessly integrate all assigned elements; the technician aspect, the "elegantly clumsy" trait, and the ghost tour's specific utility here feel underdeveloped or somewhat forced, preventing flawless cohesion.</comment>
