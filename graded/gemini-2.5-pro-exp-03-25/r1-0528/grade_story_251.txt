<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strength: The "happily sad" attribute is deeply felt. Weakness: "Bashful arrogance" is somewhat more stated than organically shown; the prophet's choice of jigsaw puzzles as a *non*-prophetic tool creates slight conceptual friction, though inventive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strength: Clear, compelling arc with high stakes and a definitive resolution. Weakness: The core mechanism (jigsaw pieces altering cosmic reality) relies on assertive fantasy logic that, while creative, is a significant imaginative leap.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strength: Exceptionally vivid lunar colony setting effectively grounds cosmic events; strong sensory details create a palpable, consistent atmosphere that supports the narrative's tone and themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strength: Powerful, original central metaphor (puzzle as reality) and striking imagery create memorable impact. Weakness: Occasional phrases verge on overly ornate, slightly risking 'purple prose,' though the style is generally effective and ambitious.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strength: Highly original premise and a distinctive authorial voice; nuanced emotional portrayal largely avoids clich√©. Weakness: Thematic repetition of key phrases ("bashful arrogance," "between heartbeats"), while purposeful, borders on being slightly heavy-handed for flawless execution.</comment>
