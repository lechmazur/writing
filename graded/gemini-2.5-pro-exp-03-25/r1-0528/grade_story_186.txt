<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The character's shift in motivation is potent, but the initial "whimsical" attribute feels underdeveloped and somewhat superficial against the ensuing gravitas.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a commendable arc within the word limit; however, the sudden materialization of the fortune-tellers as the catalytic event feels somewhat contrived, despite later narrative framing.</comment>
