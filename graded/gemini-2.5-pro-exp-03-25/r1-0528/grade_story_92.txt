<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Voice is strong, but the "carefully careless" attribute feels more described than deeply embodied, and the core motivation, while present, is somewhat explicitly stated rather than subtly revealed through action alone.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and builds tension effectively within the word limit, but the blood drive flashback, while functional, feels slightly too direct an expository mechanism for establishing the "silent agreement."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptionally strong. The botanical collection is a brilliantly unsettling and unique element, and specific sensory details ("damp earth and cloyingly sweet") create a palpable, immersive, and chilling atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Evocative imagery and a clear central conflict are present; however, the explicit articulation of the protagonist's justification ("to prove I wasnâ€™t just a servant...") slightly diminishes the narrative's subtlety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, and the blend of familiar tropes (haunted house) with unique specifics (botanical horror, dog walker's resolve) lends originality, largely avoiding formulaic pitfalls.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a strong, cohesive atmospheric effect, and the elements are generally well-integrated, creating a memorable vignette that successfully uses its brief length to its advantage.</comment>
