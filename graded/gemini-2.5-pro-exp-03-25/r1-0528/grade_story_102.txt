<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Kael's character arc from spineless to resolute, while central, feels narratively accelerated; Elara remains a functional catalyst rather than a deeply explored mentor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear quest structure and effective pacing within the word limit, though Elara's abrupt decision to mentor is underdeveloped and the key-based solution, while thematic, is convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional world-building with the unique 'map projection room' creating a palpable, supportive atmosphere; the 'grandly trivial' key is masterfully juxtaposed with the cosmic setting using vivid sensory details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Striking impact from the original 'grandly trivial' paradox and powerful, symbolic imagery (celestial whale, coded scream); elevated prose effectively conveys resonant themes of hidden power and courage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High originality in concept and the blending of disparate elements effectively subverts common tropes; while the rich prose is largely purposeful, the repetition of thematic phrases like "luminous doubt" slightly dulls its freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Remarkably cohesive and imaginative, leveraging its 'grandly trivial' core to unite challenging elements into a memorable, thought-provoking narrative that lingers beyond its brief length.</comment>
