<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Static's "stoic" and "earnest" traits are clear, but "pompous humility" is underdeveloped in the core interaction; his pivotal internal shift feels somewhat telegraphed rather than organically shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Coherent plot driven by the "lost wallet" method, achieving a clear arc; the "gasp" is an emotional peak, not a primary plot driver.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Potent atmosphere achieved through well-contrasted settings and excellent use of the "band stop" timeframe, enhanced by generally effective sensory details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Achieves emotional impact via Elara and symbolism, but Static's internal change relies on some clich√©d emotional metaphors, and the theme is stated too overtly in the conclusion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Prose verges on "purple" with excessive adjectival/adverbial density; significant reliance on common emotional expressions and tropes (e.g., "ice around his heart") undermines originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Creatively combines disparate elements, but the ambitious prose frequently becomes overwrought, and familiar emotional beats prevent it from reaching top literary standards without revision.</comment>
