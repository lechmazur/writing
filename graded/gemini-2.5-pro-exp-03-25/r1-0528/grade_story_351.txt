<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and central, but the "formally rebellious" attribute lacks convincing demonstration within the narrative, feeling more asserted than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong structural coherence with a well-managed arc and pacing; the central action effectively propels the narrative to a satisfying conclusion within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The setting and atmosphere are highly evocative and thematically resonant, though a few descriptive phrases (e.g., "emerald tendrils") verge on clich√©, slightly undermining the otherwise strong world-building.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story achieves thematic depth with potent imagery, but the sheer density of figurative language occasionally borders on overwriting, diluting the impact of individual metaphors.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Significant reliance on consistently ornate, "purple" prose and some familiar narrative tropes (hidden object in ruins, mysterious photo) diminish originality and authenticity, feeling stylistically overwrought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While elements are thematically well-integrated to serve a clear purpose, the pervasive stylistic choice of highly ornate prose is a major barrier to highest-tier publishability.</comment>
