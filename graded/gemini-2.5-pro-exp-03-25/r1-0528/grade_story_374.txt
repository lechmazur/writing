<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lyra’s “minstrel” attribute feels unearned and significantly underdeveloped, a label rather than an integrated character facet; Hemlock’s transformation is the main character-driven event.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent and delivers a clear arc within the word limit, but relies on a conventional conflict-resolution pattern with limited narrative surprise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of rustic stables and futuristic city is a strong, evocative concept, though the futuristic details themselves lean towards the generic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (stamp, sky) to achieve a resonant ending, but is weakened by stylistic choices like noticeable phrase repetition ("bizarrely typical").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the setting offers a veneer of originality, the core emotional arc of feuding rivals finding common ground and the repetition of distinctive phrases feels formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story shows creative potential in its premise, but the execution is uneven, with some elements (like the "minstrel" trait) feeling forced rather than organically serving the narrative.</comment>
