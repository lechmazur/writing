<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Compelling motivational arc from escapism to acceptance; the "nostalgic" trait, while present, could be more deeply woven into his actions beyond initial setup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Achieves a complete and satisfying narrative arc within the word limit; the "method" (improbable confessions) feels slightly more asserted by the narrative than organically emerging from character choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vividly realized world with strong steampunk/cosmic synergy that powerfully supports the narrative; "aetheric storm" is a minor use of a common genre term.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Offers a nuanced emotional journey and a relatively fresh synthesis of familiar concepts; the stylistic repetition of a key descriptive phrase ("subtly menacing") detracts from overall polish.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ambitious and largely successful integration of numerous assigned elements into a cohesive emotional narrative; minor executional imperfections prevent it from reaching flawless.</comment>
