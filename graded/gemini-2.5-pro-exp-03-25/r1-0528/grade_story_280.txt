<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The "beekeeper" aspect of the character feels somewhat ornamental and less integrated into her present strategic thinking compared to the "hermit" or "strategist" facets, which are more clearly defined by her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>A key descriptive phrase ("pattern of animal tracks in the snow") is repeated verbatim in close succession, which is stylistically weak; the external plot is minimal, relying on a brief, quickly resolved encounter.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of the vast cosmic setting with the intimate, terrestrial focus on snow tracks creates a powerful atmosphere, a significant strength, though the quasar deck itself is somewhat passive after its introduction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story occasionally resorts to directly stating its themes (e.g., "mixed blessings," "magnificent simplicity") rather than purely conveying them through action and subtext, a slight lack of subtlety for the highest tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("mixed blessings," the description of tracks) and the somewhat stock nature of the intern character detract from the overall originality and polish expected for flawless work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>While the core concept is original and many elements are woven together effectively, minor stylistic infelicities and instances of telling over showing prevent the story from achieving the mark of truly flawless execution.</comment>
