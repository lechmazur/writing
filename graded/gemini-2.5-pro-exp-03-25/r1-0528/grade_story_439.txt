<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear, but the 'mute' attribute's unique impact and the 'unassumingly bold' trait feel somewhat underdeveloped or underexplored in shaping her specific actions/perceptions beyond general protagonist behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot is coherent, achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, and effectively uses the comet to drive the action; the 'mind's escape' concept is well integrated into the resolution.</comment>
