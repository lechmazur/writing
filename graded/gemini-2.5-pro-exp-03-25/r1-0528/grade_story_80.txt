<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The "ingeniously clueless" attribute feels somewhat unbalanced; "ingenious" is demonstrated via method, but "clueless" is more asserted than compellingly integrated into the narrative's dramatic tension or consequences.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the arc is complete, the metaphorical "frantic page turns of an unseen ledger" feels like a less original, somewhat forced device compared to the story's stronger elements, slightly marring coherence at a crucial moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The roller coaster setting is powerfully evocative and rich in sensory detail, but the "amid page turns" timeframe feels less tangibly integrated into the climax scene itself, relying on symbolic rather than literal presence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story possesses strong imagery and a thoughtful thematic resolution, but some key insights, particularly the nature of the riddle's answer, are stated directly rather than purely evoked, slightly diminishing subtextual depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The core investigative method offers originality, but some descriptive phrases ("forgotten grandeur," "riddle older than time") and the "unseen ledger" image lean towards familiar conventions, lacking consistent, striking freshness throughout.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story integrates its elements with considerable skill, but minor reliance on conventional phrasing and a somewhat passively depicted character attribute ("clueless") prevent it from achieving flawless, high-impact execution.</comment>
