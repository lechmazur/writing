<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and actions align, but depth and unique voice could be more pronounced for top-tier. "Headstrong" is demonstrated; "mage" is functional rather than deeply explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a clear arc driven by the action; the internal "confession" resolves effectively for her arc, though the larger world's resolution is a single, striking moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Highly evocative world-building with strong sensory details and effective use of contrast; the atmosphere strongly supports the narrative and character's motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Powerful imagery and symbolism create emotional impact with a unique central concept; however, the prose, while often beautiful, occasionally borders on overly ornate for the highest literary standard.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Original central premise and nuanced emotion avoid common AI tells; yet, the consistently rich, "poetic" prose sometimes feels self-conscious, with some adjectival choices overly lush, lacking consistent freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements are creatively and cohesively integrated, serving a focused narrative; the ambitious magical concept is generally well-executed but its ultimate literary success hinges on the prose consistently hitting "brilliant" rather than "ornate."</comment>
