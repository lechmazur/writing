<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Arne's motivation is compelling and consistently drives his actions; the "farmer" aspect is present (calloused hands, patience) but feels somewhat lightly sketched rather than deeply integrated into his unique restorative skill.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot offers a clear and satisfying arc from setup through tension to resolution, effectively driven by the restoration attempt. The pacing is well-managed for the short form, and the method is presented with sufficient internal logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The northern lights setting is exceptionally well-utilized, creating a potent, almost magical atmosphere that strongly supports the story's tone and the significance of Arne's task; sensory details are rich and immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a strong emotional impact, particularly the sense of connection across generations. Literary devices are employed effectively, and the central theme of preserving heritage is clear and resonant. The conflict is well-defined and resolved.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The core premise of alchemical sound restoration is highly original; however, the verbatim repetition of the phrases "effectively unique" and "hushed euphoria" is a significant blemish, feeling mechanical and detracting from otherwise polished prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates commendable creativity in combining its assigned elements into a cohesive and evocative narrative.
