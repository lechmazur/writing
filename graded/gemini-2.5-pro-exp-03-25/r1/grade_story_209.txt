<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivation hinges on a somewhat abrupt revelation rather than organic development; the 'seasoned woodsman' trait feels underutilized beyond basic competence and a connection to nature.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Plot relies on convenient devices (short-circuit, hidden compartment precisely where needed) and the coherence is strained by the introduction of a supernatural element that feels unearned within the established realism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The 'radio wave garden' setting is evocative but feels conceptually disconnected from the core emotional narrative and the water tower setting; atmosphere is strong but leans heavily on the grief motif.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>While emotionally resonant, the story employs fairly obvious symbolism (hairbrush) and the supernatural resolution potentially simplifies the complex theme of processing grief and guilt through honesty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Relies on familiar tropes (grieving parent, hidden family secret revealed posthumously) and some descriptive language borders on clich√© ("rusted veins," "iron belly"); the supernatural voice feels like a predictable, sentimental resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story struggles to cohesively integrate disparate elements like the radio wave garden and the supernatural voice with the grounded grief narrative; feels more constructed around prompts than organically grown.</comment>
