<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The character feels more like a narrative function than a developed individual; "unsettled" and "accidentally heroic" are stated but lack deep exploration or a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a surreal coherence and uses the 'align' action effectively, but the inciting incident (photo) feels disconnected from the core beach climax, and the prophecy miscount is convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric creation; the seashell setting, puzzle box object, and urgent tone work synergistically, enhanced by evocative sensory details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (box, shell, reversed wish) and a clear theme emerge, but the density of literary devices occasionally borders on overwrought, slightly diminishing impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The core concept offers originality, yet some phrasing ("prophecy's dust") and the asserted "sharp gentleness" tone lean towards stylistic affectation rather than authentic voice or truly fresh expression.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements are creatively combined, particularly the box/shell/wish mechanics, but the story doesn't fully transcend the feeling of being constructed *around* these elements, lacking ultimate cohesion.</comment>
