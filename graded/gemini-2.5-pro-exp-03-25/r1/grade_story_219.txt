<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The 'fading champion' attribute feels asserted rather than demonstrated; her past prowess and current decline lack grounding. Motivation is clear but lacks nuanced connection to her actions beyond initiating the plot; her transformation feels conceptually driven rather than character-driven.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot hinges entirely on the swan mechanism, feeling somewhat contrived. The central revelation about consciousness shifts abruptly from 'rivers' to 'roots' without sufficient development. Pacing is dense, sacrificing depth for rapid progression within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is strongly evoked ("brittle hush," "broken clock"), but relies on potentially overwrought descriptions. The connection between the corn husk object and the island setting feels tenuous until the final, somewhat convenient, integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Heavy reliance on metaphor and symbolism (swan, husk, roots) is ambitious but occasionally obscures rather than illuminates. The emotional impact feels intellectualized; the ending's transcendence is abrupt and lacks sufficient emotional build-up. Shows promise but lacks polish.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The combination of elements is original, but the prose occasionally strains for effect ("gears fossilized mid-tick," "radial burst of moments"), bordering on purple prose. Some metaphors land better than others; avoids obvious clich√©s but doesn't feel entirely effortless or authentic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the elements are technically integrated, their density makes the narrative feel somewhat constructed *around* them rather than flowing organically. The ambitious style sometimes hinders clarity and emotional resonance. Feels more like a promising sketch than a finished piece.</comment>
