<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The 'amiable scholar' archetype feels underdeveloped; his amiability is asserted rather than shown, and his internal reaction to the supernatural events lacks nuanced depth beyond gasping. Motivation is clear but lacks compelling force within the narrative action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot structure, driven by the crossword puzzle interacting with the lighthouse's memories, is coherent and achieves a mini-arc. However, the connection between the grant news ('waiting room') and the core supernatural event feels tenuous and underdeveloped, weakening overall coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Excellent atmosphere; the haunted lighthouse setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details (groaning timbers, flickering light, cold wall) that effectively enhance the supernatural mood and the character's experience. The setting is integral to the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Good use of symbolism (crossword/windows, light/shadow) and evocative imagery. The central theme of listening to the past is clear and the ending offers a sense of resolution. However, the emotional impact feels slightly muted, relying more on description than deep character resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the crossword integration offers some novelty, the haunted location revealing past trauma is a familiar trope. Some phrasing ("salt-stained regrets," "spectral applause") borders on clich√© or slightly purple prose. It avoids obvious AI tells but lacks a truly distinctive voice or surprising subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story integrates most elements reasonably well, particularly the setting, object, and action. The core concept works. However, the timeframe element feels poorly integrated, slightly hindering overall cohesion. The brief length feels appropriate for the focused event depicted.</comment>
