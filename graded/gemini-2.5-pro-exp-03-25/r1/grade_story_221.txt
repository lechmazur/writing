<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to escape her father's shadow is clear and drives her actions. The 'wreck-diver ghost whisperer' aspect feels slightly less integrated than her core grief/legacy struggle, though it establishes her connection to the past. Her internal shift feels earned, but the transition within the tight word count is rapid. Her voice emerges, particularly in her final actions and letter.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is remarkably effective for the word count, presenting a clear arc: return, catalyst (amber), confrontation (ghost), climax (burning letter/throwing amber), and resolution (departure). The pacing is swift but controlled, managing exposition and action well. Cause and effect are logical within the established magical realism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is a significant strength. The juxtaposition of the decaying, wind-swept carnival and the oceanic past creates a potent, melancholic mood. Sensory details ("peeling clown murals grinning like skulls," "brine-dripping," "cracked plaster ducks") are vivid and effectively ground the supernatural elements. The setting directly enhances the themes of memory, decay, and breaking free.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story achieves considerable emotional impact and thematic depth. Symbolism (amber, mayfly, bullseye, letter, tides) is woven skillfully throughout. The central conflict is internal and resolved satisfyingly. The writing craft is strong, employing evocative imagery and metaphor ("grief iced him," "telephone poles blurred into ship masts"). The ending resonates with the theme of self-discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The combination of elements (diving, ghosts, carnival, amber) feels original and avoids predictable templates. While concepts like parental legacy and finding oneself are common, the specific execution here is fresh. Language is largely specific and avoids clich√©, though "joyfully melancholic" borders on the familiar. Emotion is shown effectively through action and symbolism rather than just stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story demonstrates impressive cohesion, integrating disparate elements into a meaningful narrative. The assigned components feel purposeful rather than forced constraints. The brevity enhances the feeling of a pivotal, fleeting moment of change. It leaves the reader with a sense of resolution tinged with melancholy, achieving depth beyond its length.</comment>
