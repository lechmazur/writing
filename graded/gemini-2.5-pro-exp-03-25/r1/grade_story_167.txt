<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation (justice for the Lament) is clear and drives the action, but the "dutiful scholar" trait feels underdeveloped or superficially contradicted by her immediate, decisive rebellion without sufficient exploration of the internal conflict this implies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot structure is efficient and coherent within the word limit, effectively using the action (contaminate) and method (well echo). However, the instantaneous arrival of the page feels slightly too convenient, slightly weakening cause/effect plausibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting (capsule hotel) and timeframe (pre-evaluation) create effective tension and atmosphere. Sensory details (ozone, static, moss) are well-used. The connection between the well, the coil, and the time-travel context is strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance regarding censorship and history. Effective use of imagery ("coffins for the chronologically unmoored") and symbolism (the coil, the well). The final line feels slightly declarative, slightly diminishing the preceding subtlety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The core concept is original, but some phrasing ("temporal fissures," "chrono-blades") leans towards genre convention. While avoiding major clich√©s, the narrative doesn't entirely escape a familiar "lone rebel vs. oppressive authority" structure. Emotion is shown, but lacks deep nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates commendable cohesion and creative integration of disparate elements within a constrained format. It successfully builds a specific mood and delivers a resonant thematic point, feeling like a deliberate piece of flash fiction.</comment>
