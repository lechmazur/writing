<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character feels more like a vessel for the plot; assigned attribute "aloofly intimate" is barely present and motivation is generic for the genre.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot progression feels somewhat contrived, particularly the interpretation of 'advocate' and the convenient message reveal mechanism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The desired "mundane enchantment" tone feels underdeveloped and inconsistently applied throughout the setting and narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While symbolism (cards, tide) is effective, the prose occasionally strains for lyricism, and the theme isn't explored with sufficient depth for this level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story avoids obvious clich√©s but lacks a truly unique voice or perspective; some phrasing feels slightly forced or overly familiar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Integration of elements feels uneven (esp. 'advocate', 'aloofly intimate'); the story serves the prompts adequately but doesn't achieve seamless, inevitable cohesion.</comment>
