<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The 'awkward champion' trait feels superficial and underdeveloped; her awkwardness isn't deeply woven into her actions or the core conflict beyond a stated preference.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc, but the resolution with the Time Council feels abrupt and overly convenient, slightly undermining the established tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is strongly evoked through sensory details, but relies heavily on stating abstract concepts like 'paradoxes' rather than fully integrating them into the tangible world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Craft is evident in the unique central metaphor and evocative imagery, but the philosophical depth ('philosophy of perhaps') remains somewhat asserted rather than deeply explored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the core concept is original, the prose occasionally borders on overwrought ('purple prose'), lacking the restraint expected in top-tier literary fiction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates disparate elements into a cohesive whole, but feels more like an imaginative concept sketch than a fully realized narrative with compelling depth.</comment>
