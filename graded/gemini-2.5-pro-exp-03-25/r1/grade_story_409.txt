<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Kael's transformation from fighter to keeper feels abrupt within the word count; the Sculptor remains largely symbolic, and her assigned attribute "skillfully incompetent" is asserted rather than effectively demonstrated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc but feels compressed and rushed; the "abducted through forgotten dreams" mechanism is vague and underdeveloped, slightly straining coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story creatively integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive, atmospheric whole, but minor logical gaps and the rapid resolution prevent it from reaching flawless execution.</comment>
