<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Clyde's motivation is clear, but the "socially awkward" and "hopefully cynical" traits feel somewhat superficial, stated rather than deeply demonstrated through nuanced action or voice within the limited scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, effectively using the action/method. However, the resolution (sapling glyph) feels slightly abrupt and allegorically neat rather than a fully earned narrative turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Excellent synthesis of the late-night diner setting and the high-tech/mystical archive concept, creating a distinct and evocative atmosphere supported by good sensory details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (whistle, archive, sapling) and an intriguing central concept create impact. The craft is generally high, though the emotional shift feels slightly accelerated for the word count.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The core concept blending technology and regret is original. While avoiding major clich√©s, some phrasing ("psychic roots," "gnawing need") borders on overly literary, slightly compromising raw authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves strong cohesion, integrating most elements effectively. The "forgotten arts" feels less integral than other components, slightly weakening the overall flawless integration required.</comment>
