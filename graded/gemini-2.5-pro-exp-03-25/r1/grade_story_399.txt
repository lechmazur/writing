<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The character arc feels somewhat externally driven by the magical elements (ash, mandala) rather than stemming purely from internal volition, and the 'grumpy' trait feels like a superficial starting point rather than a deeply explored facet influencing the resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a contained arc, but the resolution hinges on mystical convenience (ash manifesting the sister, mandala shifts) and feels abrupt for the depth of trauma implied. The assigned action 'jiggle' feels weakly integrated and lacks significant narrative force.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The atmosphere is effectively evoked through sensory details and the juxtaposition of the crypt and scrying room, but the combination of elements (crystals, mandala, witch) leans towards familiar mystical tropes rather than forging a truly unique world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (mandala, constellations), but the theme (trauma as a map) is stated too explicitly at the end, diminishing subtext. The emotional resolution feels somewhat neat and complete for the subject matter, lacking lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While the central constellation metaphor offers some originality, the overall narrative structure (confronting a spectral representation of trauma leading to acceptance) follows a recognizable therapeutic/fantasy pattern. The language is generally competent but occasionally strains for poetic effect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story manages to weave the disparate elements together, but their mandatory inclusion feels noticeable, particularly weaker links like the 'jiggle' action. It reads more like a skillful execution of constraints than a wholly organic narrative.</comment>
