<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and tied to the generational conflict, but the character's internal landscape beyond this core conflict feels underdeveloped; the "closed-off" nature is asserted more than demonstrated through nuanced interaction or introspection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Efficient plot progression achieves a clear arc within the word limit, but the central transformation hinges on a single, somewhat sudden action without deeper exploration of the internal shift leading up to the leap.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid and well-realized setting that strongly supports the narrative's atmosphere and themes, though occasionally the descriptions border on overly stylized prose ("hummed with fractured light").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (drawing, Crow-Cage) and resonant imagery creates thematic depth, but the final lines summarizing the theme (*"Stars are stolen lies..."*) lack subtlety, bordering on didacticism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Generally original concept and execution, avoiding overt clich√©s. However, some descriptive phrases ("syrup-thick and rotting," "prismatic hedges") lean towards familiar stylistic choices within the genre, slightly dulling its unique edge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of the required elements creates a strong overall impression and a purposeful narrative arc, though the reliance on the Crow-Cage for exposition and motivation feels slightly convenient.</comment>
