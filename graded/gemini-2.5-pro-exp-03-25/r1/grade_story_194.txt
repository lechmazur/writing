<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The lumberjack's motivation (healing from trauma) is established but his transition to rebel feels plot-driven rather than deeply internalised. Vanya's 'gracefully awkward' trait is mentioned but minimally demonstrated, lacking significant impact on her actions or the plot beyond a superficial contrast.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot progresses rapidly from personal healing to espionage, achieving a complete arc within the word limit. However, the coherence relies heavily on convenient reveals (coded letter, sudden confession, map on femur), making cause and effect feel somewhat contrived rather than organic. Pacing is breakneck.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The core setting (ossuary restaurant) is highly atmospheric and original, effectively blending the macabre with the gourmet. Sensory details are present, but the 'harsh tenderness' tone feels more asserted than consistently evoked through nuanced description or interaction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolic potential (ax, bones, lichen) and an intriguing central conflict shift. However, the story leans more towards telling emotional states ("haunted him," "nightmares now fuel") rather than consistently showing them through action or subtle characterisation. The ending message provides resonance, but the journey lacks deep subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The premise is original, but the execution includes some slightly overwrought phrases ("symphonies of quiet rebellion") and relies on familiar tropes (coded messages, reluctant hero). Character reasoning, particularly the lumberjack's swift commitment to rebellion, lacks deep psychological nuance, feeling somewhat formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story successfully incorporates disparate elements into a cohesive, albeit rushed, narrative. The ossuary setting and the transformation of the ax's purpose are creative highlights. However, the compression required by the word count sacrifices depth, particularly in character development and thematic exploration.</comment>
