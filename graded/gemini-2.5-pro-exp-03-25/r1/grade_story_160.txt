<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The character's motivation ("defy finality") is abstract and feels somewhat imposed rather than deeply intrinsic. While actions align, the 'analytically free' trait is tied solely to the goggles, limiting insight into the character's core personality without them. Voice is consistent but lacks profound distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is efficient and coherent within the word limit, achieving a clear arc. However, the inciting incident (briefcase code) feels slightly convenient, and the resolution, while tidy, lacks significant complexity or surprise. Pacing is well-managed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The setting (abandoned repair bay) is highly evocative and atmospherically strong, synergizing well with the object (goggles) and timeframe. Sensory details are effective. The integration of the 'wilderness wisdom' concept feels less organic compared to other elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Craft is strong, with effective imagery ("shadows clung like bats," "tactile asterisks") and symbolism. The theme of defiance is clear and the ending resonates. However, the captain's vision feels slightly didactic in delivering the theme, rather than purely emergent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The combination of elements offers originality. While generally avoiding clich√©s, some phrasing ("smug executioner," "prickly wonder bristling") borders on mannered or slightly overwrought, preventing a feeling of flawless authenticity. Does not feel AI-generated, but prose isn't perfectly polished.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story achieves strong cohesion, largely integrating the disparate elements effectively in service of the narrative. The brevity feels purposeful. While creative, the slightly forced feel of one or two elements prevents a perfect score.</comment>
