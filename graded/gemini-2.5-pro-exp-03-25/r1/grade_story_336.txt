<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The character is functional and consistent (weary undertaker fits the tone and actions), but lacks deep, unique interiority or voice beyond the established archetype. The 'undertaker' profession feels slightly underutilized beyond surface weariness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot structure is commendably tight and coherent for the word count, with a clear arc driven by the core action (imprison). Pacing is effective, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt. The time distortion element is intriguing but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Excellent atmospheric creation, effectively blending the ancient setting with the mundane intrusion (backfire). Sensory details are evocative, and the setting/object (palace/clock) are intrinsically linked to the plot and mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong literary craft, particularly imagery ("phantom sun path," "light into chains") and symbolism (clock, time). The story successfully evokes tension and explores themes of duty and legacy. Shows effectively over tells.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Largely avoids clich√©s and generic phrasing, demonstrating some originality in metaphors. However, certain phrases ("tribal truth," "palace's marrow") lean towards familiar fantasy/horror tropes rather than truly groundbreaking expression. Consistency is good.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves strong cohesion, integrating the required elements purposefully rather than feeling forced. The brevity feels intentional, contributing to the focused intensity. It leaves a lingering sense of cyclical struggle.</comment>
