<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Motivation (preserve music) is clear, but the 'feral' attribute feels superficial, mainly manifesting as agility. The 'effortlessly complicated' trait is stated but not convincingly demonstrated through action or internal thought. Character voice is minimal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear, concise arc driven by the 'conserve' action. The leaf falling method provides a unique timing mechanism. Achieves a sense of completeness within the word limit, with effective pacing and logical flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Excellent atmospheric creation through the unique setting (invisible ink factory) and timeframe (between vanishing stars). Strong sensory details (smell of rosemary/regret, glimmering dust) effectively immerse the reader and support the melancholic mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High level of craft with evocative imagery ("portable sky," "liquid midnight") and symbolism (fading stars/memory). Explores themes of preservation, loss, and cost effectively. The ending is purposeful and resonant, leaving a sense of subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The core concept is original, but the prose occasionally verges on overly ornate ("glimmered like crushed constellations"), risking 'purple prose'. While avoiding major clich√©s, the sheer density of figurative language can feel slightly artificial or strained.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The disparate elements are woven together creatively into a cohesive, atmospheric vignette. The story successfully uses the constraints to create a focused narrative that leaves a lingering emotional impact, feeling deliberate rather than limited.</comment>
