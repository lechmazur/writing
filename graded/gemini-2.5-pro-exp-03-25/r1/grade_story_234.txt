<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The core character traits ("gentle swordsman," "faithfully unfaithful") feel somewhat asserted rather than fully demonstrated or integrated through action, particularly the "gentle" aspect which contrasts with the theft.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Efficient plot progression within the word limit, though it relies on convenient tropes (hidden drawer puzzle) and a simplistic obstacle resolution (guard).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Evocative atmosphere is a significant strength, effectively using the unique setting, though the thematic link between dinosaurs and the cosmic objective could be more deeply resonant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong literary craft and effective subtext regarding the relationship elevate the narrative, but it stops short of achieving truly profound emotional depth or groundbreaking thematic insight required for the highest tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally avoids clich√© and obvious AI tells through a unique setting/objective combination, but some phrasing ("fragile eternities") borders on the self-consciously literary rather than feeling organically original.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally cohesive and moody, but the integration of *all* assigned elements isn't seamless (e.g., "late bloomers," "xenophile"), slightly weakening the overall impact and feeling of deliberate construction.</comment>
