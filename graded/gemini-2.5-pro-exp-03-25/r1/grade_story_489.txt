<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (rescue traditions) and consistent, but the 'aggressively kind' attribute feels superficially applied via backstory rather than organically demonstrated through the observer's core actions or spectral nature. The reveal of her identity adds depth but feels somewhat compressed within the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot structure is effective within the word limit, achieving a clear arc from inertia to action to resolution. The whale's call acts as a strong catalyst, and the whistle transfer provides a pivotal moment. Pacing is tight but generally well-managed, though the ending feels slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is powerfully evoked and intrinsically linked to the character, theme, and action. Atmospheric details (storm, salt, whale song) create a strong sense of mood that effectively supports the mystical narrative and the observer's purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (whistle, whale, dance) and evocative imagery elevates the narrative. The theme of tradition as a living force is clearly conveyed and resonant. The story successfully evokes a sense of mystery and melancholy, achieving significant impact despite its brevity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The combination of elements feels relatively original, avoiding overt clich√©s. While the prose is generally strong, occasional phrases ("hummed with salt-stained silence") lean towards slightly ornate. The core concept avoids predictable templates, offering a fresh take on spectral duty and tradition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its disparate elements into a cohesive and atmospheric whole. The brevity feels purposeful, creating an intense, focused narrative snapshot. It leaves the reader with a lingering sense of the mystical connection between past and present.</comment>
