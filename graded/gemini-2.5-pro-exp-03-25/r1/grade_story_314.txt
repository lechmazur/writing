<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation (repressed grief manifesting via workaholism) is clear, but the character development feels accelerated. The transition from stoic enforcer to emotionally raw participant, while necessary for the plot, lacks nuanced psychological steps. The '72 hours awake' detail feels slightly superficial.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the supernatural encounter to drive Mira's arc within the word limit. Cause and effect are clear within the story's magical logic. However, the pacing is rapid, and the resolution, while fitting for flash, feels somewhat abrupt for the depth of trauma addressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The kelp forest setting and observation post create a strong, unique atmosphere, effectively contrasting the mundane (bread box) with the futuristic/supernatural. Sensory details are generally well-employed. The 'utopia' aspect remains somewhat underdeveloped background context.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story successfully uses symbolism (bread box, drumstick, pearl) and imagery to convey its theme of confronting grief. However, moments like the floating enforcement orders explicitly stating Mira's fear (*"I'm afraid to stop. Afraid to remember."*) verge on telling rather than showing the subtext, slightly diminishing the craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The combination of elements (sci-fi setting, rustic object, supernatural grief ritual) offers originality. However, some descriptive language ("woven from bioluminescence and regret") borders on overly ornate. The core emotional arc, while handled with unique details, touches on familiar tropes of workaholism masking pain.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates commendable cohesion, integrating the required elements purposefully rather than feeling forced. It functions effectively as a piece of flash fiction. However, judged by the highest literary standards demanding flawless execution and profound depth, the necessary brevity limits its overall complexity and resonance.</comment>
