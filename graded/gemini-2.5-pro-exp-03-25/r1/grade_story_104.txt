<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The steward's stoicism and motivation are clear and consistent, driving her actions. However, the 'stoic' trait feels somewhat explicitly stated rather than purely demonstrated through nuanced action alone, and her voice is limited by minimal dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a commendable arc within the word limit, but the initiating action 'venerate' feels more like thematic reinforcement than a primary plot driver. The ending, while impactful, feels slightly abrupt, compressing the climax and resolution significantly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Excellent integration of setting, timeframe, and object. The miniature world museum is highly evocative and enhances the theme and action. Sensory details are strong, creating a palpable atmosphere that supports the narrative's core tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (cameo, miniatures, termites) and evocative imagery creates subtext and thematic depth. The central conflict is clear, and the ending is purposeful, though some literary devices border on being slightly overwrought ("misguided confetti").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The combination of elements feels largely original, avoiding obvious clich√©s. The writing style is distinct, and metaphors are generally fresh. While the core concept isn't entirely unique, its execution within this specific setting and context shows ingenuity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong cohesion, weaving most assigned elements effectively into a compelling narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, enhancing the sense of urgency and fleeting resistance. It successfully leaves a lingering impression of defiant melancholy.</comment>
