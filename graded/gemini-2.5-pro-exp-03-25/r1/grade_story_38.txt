<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The poet's transformation from fearful insomniac to empathetic listener is compelling, driven by the core conflict; however, the initial motivation shift relies slightly heavily on the external botanist's insight rather than purely internal discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Excellent arc and coherence within the word limit; the plot progresses logically from misunderstanding ('eliminate') to revelation and resolution. Pacing is effective, using the subway stops as structural beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is superb; the 'meticulously messy' attic, the eerie whispers contrasted with mundane subway sounds, and the botanical elements create a rich, tangible world that strongly supports the narrative and themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High impact through potent imagery (strangled typewriter, penitent stems), strong subtext (grief, memory, healing), and a satisfying, resonant ending. The central conflict is clear and resolved thoughtfully, exploring themes of listening and atonement effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Largely original, subverting the haunted house trope into a 'refugee camp'. Metaphors are fresh and specific ("roots feed on grief," "forgiveness could compost shame"). Avoids significant clich√©s and maintains a unique voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Highly cohesive; the assigned elements feel organically woven into a unique narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, concentrating the story's emotional and thematic weight. Leaves a lingering sense of complex peace.</comment>
