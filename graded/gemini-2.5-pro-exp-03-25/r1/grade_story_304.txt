<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The assassin's motivation pivots too sharply from executioner to savior without sufficient internal justification; the 'cradle the dawn' motive feels applied post-hoc rather than intrinsic. The driver's motivation is clearer but leans towards melodrama.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is sound with a compelling twist, but the stated reason for the plan's failure (the web pattern) misattributes the cause; the failure stems from a flawed premise about the target, not the methodology. Pacing is effective.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional; the baroque asteroid setting is vividly realized and integrated seamlessly with the action and atmosphere. The 'borrowed starlight' tone is consistently maintained through strong sensory details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong literary craft with evocative imagery (camera, web) and symbolism. The dialogue is sharp. However, the emotional impact of the ending is slightly undercut by the assassin's underdeveloped character arc. Shows more than tells effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The core concept and specific details like the camera-ledger offer significant originality. While the language is ambitious and mostly effective, it occasionally borders on overwrought. Avoids major tropes and AI tells.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Most elements integrate well, enhancing the unique setting and plot, but the assassin's assigned motivation feels discordant. The story achieves a cohesive, atmospheric whole despite this, leaving a distinct impression.</comment>
