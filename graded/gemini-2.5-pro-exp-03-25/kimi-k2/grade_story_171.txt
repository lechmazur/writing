<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character's core obsession is resolved too quickly and cleanly; the psychological shift from obsessive collector to altruist lacks the necessary internal conflict for it to feel entirely earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>A technically cohesive and beautifully written piece that is ultimately too sentimental. It prioritizes a heartwarming moral over the ambiguity and psychological complexity expected at the highest literary level.</comment>
