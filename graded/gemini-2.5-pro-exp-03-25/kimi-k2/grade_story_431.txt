<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The character is a potent symbol but lacks the fine-grained psychological depth of a truly living creation; the decoder is a functional mirror for the protagonist, not a fully realized character in his own right.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A well-executed symbolic arc with excellent pacing for its length, but its coherence relies entirely on metaphor, leaving the literal narrative mechanics feeling underdeveloped and thin upon close inspection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The atmosphere is powerfully and precisely rendered through specific sensory details and the seamless integration of setting and object. It is the story's most significant achievement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The literary craft is sophisticated, yet the central theme is made slightly too explicit through dialogue ("the wasteland was not outside but between them"), which marginally undermines the power of its otherwise excellent subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is distinct and the central metaphors are fresh. However, the prose occasionally leans into a self-conscious literariness that, while avoiding clich√©, borders on the overwrought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>An impressive synthesis of disparate elements into a cohesive and resonant whole. The story successfully uses its constraints to create a piece that feels deliberate and impactful, demonstrating significant artistic vision.</comment>
