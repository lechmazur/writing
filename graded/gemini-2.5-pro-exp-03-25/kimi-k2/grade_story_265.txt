<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The protagonist functions more as an archetypal lens for the story's rich themes than a fully-realized individual; her impassivity makes her slightly static, a vessel for observation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The plot relies on a simple act of witnessing, and its central fantastical premise is asserted rather than explored, which feels slightly thin despite the strong emotional arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Flawless. The synthesis of the industrial and the sacred, the profane and the natural, creates a unique, resonant, and utterly convincing world. This is the story's greatest strength.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A powerful, cohesive vignette that expertly integrates its disparate elements into a memorable whole. Its ambition and craft make it a standout piece, despite a prose style that verges on excessive.</comment>
