<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's moral transformation from cynical profiteer to principled activist is too abrupt to be fully credible, even within a surreal framework; the speed undercuts the weight of the change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot executes a complete and satisfying allegorical arc with remarkable efficiency, using the central action ("initiate") as a flawless pivot for the narrative's physical and thematic shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is a masterclass in synthesis, seamlessly blending gothic, brewing, and political elements into a potent and original world, with sensory details that are both specific and thematically resonant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The work thrives on a dense, consistent, and powerful central metaphor (brewing as moral alchemy), though it verges on over-explaining its theme in the penultimate paragraph, slightly diminishing the subtext's power.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is exceptionally strong and original, successfully combining disparate tropes (haunted house, moral awakening) into a fresh synthesis that feels distinctively authored and avoids clich√©.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates a rare cohesiveness for a constrained piece, weaving its many required elements into a thematically resonant whole that feels intentional, impactful, and far more expansive than its word count suggests.</comment>
