<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The character is rendered with impressive depth. Her "softly militant" attribute is brilliantly externalized in her gardening. The motivation, "to dissect the architecture of cosmic balance," is consistent but verges on the overly abstract, pulling the reader slightly out of her otherwise grounded, grief-stricken perspective.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a complete and satisfying internal arc. However, the plot's engine is entirely psychological, which is a valid but demanding choice. The assigned method, "by scouring dusty attics," is relegated to backstory, making its connection to the present action indirect, a slight contrivance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of world and atmosphere is flawless. The setting ("rooftop farm") is a perfect microcosm for the story's themes, and the tone ("reluctant awe") is woven into every sentence. The sensory details are specific, evocative, and create an immediate, immersive mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The craft is exceptional, particularly the use of fresh, resonant metaphors ("a wound forever knitting," "green galaxies out of ruin"). The theme of finding meaning in quiet persistence is profound. The prose is so consistently dense with literary devices that it occasionally risks feeling overwrought, but it successfully navigates this danger.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story demonstrates high originality by subverting the post-apocalyptic hero trope. Instead of a physical warrior, we get a quiet, middle-aged philosopher-gardener. The emotional nuance and unique metaphorical language show a distinct authorial voice, devoid of clich√© or algorithmic predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story is a masterclass in cohesion; every assigned element feels indispensable and serves a unified artistic vision. Its brevity is a strength, concentrating its emotional and philosophical weight. It leaves a powerful, lingering impression of defiant hope, making it a truly memorable piece.</comment>
