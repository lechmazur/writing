<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The monk’s internal arc from haunted to accepting is clear and well-executed. However, he functions more as a perfect, archetypal vessel for the theme rather than a character with idiosyncratic flaws, which slightly mutes his individual voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot structure is exceptionally tight and purposeful. The central action (crushing melodies) logically and poetically propels the narrative from the inciting incident to the thematic resolution, creating a complete and satisfying arc within the word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere of the shop is masterfully rendered with specific, evocative details. The assigned timeframe ("a world in radical change") is the single weakest link; it is stated once but never integrated, feeling extraneous to the self-contained, personal nature of the story.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The craft is of an extremely high caliber. The story is dense with original, potent metaphors ("tunes leaking like ghosts," "planets rearranged themselves like furniture") and rich symbolism, delivering a profound theme with subtlety and emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The piece demonstrates remarkable originality, particularly in its central conceit of crushing haunted melodies. It skillfully avoids cliché by subverting the quest narrative into a journey of internal realization, and the prose is consistently fresh and specific.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a rare cohesiveness, weaving its disparate elements into a powerful, theme-driven whole. It feels like a deliberate and polished piece of flash fiction, leaving a lingering, philosophical impact that demonstrates depth beyond its brief length.</comment>
