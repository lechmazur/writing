<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character concept is strong, but her success hinges on an attribute ("sincerity") that is explicitly stated in the resolution rather than proven through overcoming a meaningful obstacle. This turns her from an active agent into a convenient key for a lock designed to fit her.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but lacks genuine tension. The progression from problem to solution is linear and frictionless, making the protagonist's victory feel inevitable rather than earned. The central conflict resolves too easily for a story of this intended caliber.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story's greatest strength. The juxtaposition of goblin playground sounds with a moss-lit hall of cosmic mystery creates a uniquely memorable and potent atmosphere. However, the goblins themselves function as little more than set dressing, a missed opportunity for deeper world-building integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prose is lyrical and the symbolism is effective, but the narrative craft is undermined by a critical flaw: the resolution is delivered via exposition ("they had chosen to wait..."). This 'telling' over 'showing' at the story's climax deflates the narrative impact and feels unearned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of disparate elements (necromancy, goblins, tapestries) is highly original. However, the underlying plot structure is a conventional "test of virtue" narrative that follows familiar tropes, preventing the story from achieving true groundbreaking status.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>An aesthetically beautiful and cohesive fable. Yet, its gentle, allegorical nature makes it feel slight. It lacks the narrative grit, ambiguity, or complexity expected of top-tier literary fiction, ultimately reading as a perfect but fragile miniature rather than a robust, immersive world.</comment>
