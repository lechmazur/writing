<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The characters serve their symbolic roles effectively, but they lack psychological depth. Mara's motivation is clearly stated rather than fully embodied, and Elena exists more as a catalyst for Mara's actions than as a fully realized character with her own internal agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is exceptionally tight and coherent for its length, achieving a clear and satisfying arc. The central mechanism of rewriting the letter is powerful, though the resolution's flickering lights feel like a minor concession to a familiar ghostly trope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world-building is the story's strongest asset. The abandoned shooting gallery is not merely a backdrop but an active participant in the narrative, rich with sensory detail and symbolic weight that perfectly supports the "joyfully melancholic" atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The literary craft is superb, with a dense and resonant web of symbolism (amber, shadows, letter). However, the narrative occasionally explains its own subtext—"Now she understood..."—sacrificing a degree of subtlety that would elevate it to flawless.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story's combination of elements is original, but the prose, while lyrical, verges on overwrought. The perfect, interlocking nature of its metaphors can feel more like a polished technical exercise than an organic, breathing narrative, hinting at a formulaic precision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>This is a highly cohesive and memorable piece where the assigned elements are masterfully integrated in service of a clear theme. It is artful and impactful, held back only by a stylistic richness that occasionally feels self-conscious and a structure that is almost too perfectly resolved.</comment>
