<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear, but he functions more as a symbolic vessel for the theme than a person with discernible, unique depth. His voice is indistinct from the narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is exceptionally tight and coherent for the word count, but the resolution feels convenient, bypassing the core interpersonal conflict for a swift, symbolic conclusion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The world-building is a standout achievement in originality, but its relentless metaphorical density, while beautiful, risks feeling overwrought and overshadowing the human element.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise is highly original, yet the execution has a polished, almost programmatic feel. The perfect structure and consistently lyrical prose lack a sense of messy, human unpredictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>An intellectually impressive and cohesive story that weaves its elements flawlessly, but it maintains an emotional distance. It's a piece to be admired for its craft more than felt for its heart.</comment>
