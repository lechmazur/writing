<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The fusion of the surreal setting, the meta timeframe ("during writing"), and the specified tone is nearly flawless, creating a unique and deeply resonant atmosphere that is the story's greatest strength.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The craft is exceptional, employing a dense, continuous stream of fresh, purposeful metaphors that carry the story's theme. The prose is highly stylized but controlled and effective.</comment>
