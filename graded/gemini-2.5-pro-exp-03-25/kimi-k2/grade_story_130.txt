<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and his arc is complete, but he functions more as a symbolic vessel for the theme than a distinct personality. His internal state is heavily described rather than revealed through more nuanced action or unique voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves a remarkably coherent and complete emotional arc within the word limit. The plot is driven by a symbolic interpretation of the action "reverse-engineer," which, while effective, creates a slight dissonance between the technical term and the organic execution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The world-building is a significant strength, with the "interstellar orchard ship" providing a rich, consistent source of metaphor. However, the relentless density of sensory detail (e.g., tasting starlight twice) borders on the overwrought, risking a "purple prose" classification.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The craft is ambitious and impressive, rich with symbolism and subtext. The central internal conflict is resolved, but perhaps too neatly. The story relies heavily on telling the reader the symbolic meaning of actions ("reverse-engineered the voices into a map") rather than allowing the meaning to emerge entirely from the action itself.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept is highly original and avoids clich√©. The authorial voice is distinct, yet its primary feature is a non-stop cascade of lyrical metaphors. This singular, ornate style is so pervasive that it can feel self-conscious and detracts from a more grounded, authentic emotional core.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story is a masterclass in weaving disparate elements into a cohesive, poetic whole. It is memorable and ambitious. Its only vulnerability, from a top-tier publication standpoint, is a stylistic commitment to lyrical density that a discerning editor might see as excessive rather than economical.</comment>
