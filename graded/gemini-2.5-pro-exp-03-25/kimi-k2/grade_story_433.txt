<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The character's motivation and brokenness are well-established, but her defining traits feel more asserted than deeply integrated, lacking the specific backstory to make her suffering feel unique rather than archetypal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is exceptionally tight, with a clear and satisfying arc for the word count, but the gallery's abrupt transformation into a physical antagonist is a slightly jarring, albeit imaginative, escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's crowning achievement; the world is rendered with superb, evocative imagery that perfectly fuses the setting with the central theme, creating a powerfully immersive experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story is a masterclass in cohesion, weaving its many elements into a seamless and impactful whole, but falls just shy of perfection due to minor instances where thematic summary supplants subtext.</comment>
