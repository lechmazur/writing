<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The character's core conflict is compelling, but her transformation from "guarded" to "daring" feels mechanically tied to solving the puzzles rather than emerging from a deeper, more earned psychological shift. Her internal state changes a bit too neatly with each external lock she opens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot is a tightly constructed puzzle-box, which effectively drives the narrative and thematic arc within the word count. However, its video-game-like progression (solve A, get B) sacrifices a degree of organic discovery for this structural tidiness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world-building is the story's standout achievement. The juxtaposition of a dance studio, a psychic lab, and Catholic exorcism creates a uniquely resonant atmosphere where the fusion of science and mysticism feels not only plausible but inevitable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The craft is exceptionally high, particularly the use of dance as a sustained, multi-layered metaphor and the powerful central theme ("demons are frequencies, angels must be chords"). The ending provides a resonant, satisfying culmination of the story's ideas.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story is strikingly original, skillfully weaving disparate concepts into a fresh and unpredictable narrative. It completely avoids genre clich√©s and formulaic writing, establishing a singular voice and premise that is memorable and intellectually engaging.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>An ambitious and intellectually dense piece that masterfully integrates its required elements into a cohesive whole. Its primary strength is its powerful central metaphor and unique world; its only minor flaw is the slightly mechanistic link between the external puzzles and the character's internal evolution.</comment>
