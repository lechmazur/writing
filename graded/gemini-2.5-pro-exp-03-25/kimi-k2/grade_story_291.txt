<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The character's core motivation is powerfully rendered, but the 'ship captain' aspect feels like contextual backstory rather than an actively demonstrated part of her identity within the narrative's immediate action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is exceptionally tight with a clear and compelling arc; however, the final symbolic resolution of the maze collapsing feels slightly heavy-handed, lacking the subtlety we look for.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is palpable and masterfully executed, but the presence of "cosmic" echoes in a terrestrial park requires a slight suspension of disbelief that isn't perfectly seamless.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The use of symbolism is potent and the theme is clear, but the story verges on being overly allegorical, stating its message so directly that it sacrifices some subtext and nuance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>While the prose is sharp and avoids clich√©s, the narrative relies on the familiar trope of a literal journey through a symbolic mindscape, which lessens its overall originality despite strong execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story shows masterful cohesion of its constituent parts, but its thematic clarity and polished prose come at the cost of a certain raw, human messiness, making it feel more like a perfectly constructed thesis than a lived experience.</comment>
