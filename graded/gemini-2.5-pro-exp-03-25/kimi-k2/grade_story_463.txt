<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The character's core assigned traits ("dry-witted," motivation "to learn") are not convincingly demonstrated; his actions portray a reverent, empathetic professional applying existing knowledge, which directly contradicts the provided framework. This creates a fundamental disconnect.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot is remarkably tight and complete for the word count, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution. The central action drives the narrative forward efficiently, achieving a strong sense of closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's greatest strength. The setting is rendered with specific, evocative sensory details that are deeply integrated with the narrative's emotional and thematic core, creating a powerful sense of place and mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The craft is strong, particularly the use of the tango as a central symbol and the satisfying, resonant ending. However, the emotionality, while potent, verges on sentimental, and a minor inconsistency (tango in life, waltz in the afterlife) is a small but noticeable flaw in an otherwise precise piece.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story elevates common tropes (haunted lighthouse) with a unique and specific mythology, feeling fresh rather than formulaic. The prose is distinctive, though a slight over-reliance on similes is a minor stylistic crutch.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The piece demonstrates exceptional cohesion, weaving its disparate elements into a singular, impactful narrative. The story's brevity feels deliberate and potent, creating a vignette that is emotionally and thematically rich, leaving a lingering impression.</comment>
