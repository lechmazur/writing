<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation stemming from grief and memory, symbolized by the chopstick, is potent and consistent; however, the specific 'irate' descriptor feels underdeveloped compared to the pervasive sense of loss and determined longing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The internal plot structure, moving from memory through ritual (tea leaves) to resolve (decision to descend), provides a clear and coherent arc within the word limit; pacing effectively mirrors the character's reflective state.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is exceptionally well-realized through potent sensory details (durasteel, glass, rust, tea) that deeply integrate the abandoned spaceport setting with the character's internal state of decay and memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong emotional impact achieved through layered symbolism (chopstick, tea leaves, shadow as map) and resonant subtext (the quest's true nature); the craft effectively conveys grief and determination beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose possesses a distinct, albeit dense, style, avoiding obvious AI tells and clich√©s; metaphors are generally fresh, and emotion is nuanced, though the richness occasionally risks becoming overwrought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable cohesion, weaving the assigned elements into a resonant whole that feels deliberate and impactful despite the brevity; it leaves a lingering sense of poignant, hard-edged sincerity.</comment>
