<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The observer's motivation is clear, but the character itself feels archetypal rather than deeply developed. The 'aggressively kind' attribute is stated but lacks nuanced demonstration beyond the central action; its personality remains somewhat spectral and indistinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is remarkably tight and effective for the word count, featuring a clear inciting incident, rising action, climax (lighthouse/dancer), and resonant resolution. The cause-and-effect chain (whistle->light->dancer) is strong and coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Excellent atmospheric creation, leveraging the haunted lighthouse setting and specific timeframe effectively. Sensory details ("salt-stung creak," "shrill, spiraling note") enrich the mood, strongly supporting the narrative's mystical and melancholic tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of evocative language, symbolism (lighthouse beam, whale call), and imagery creates significant impact. The story successfully conveys themes of memory, loss, and cultural continuity with a satisfyingly ambiguous, hopeful ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While the core concept is intriguing, the prose occasionally veers into the overly ornate ("tectonic memory," "brazen calm slicing through fog and time"). The most significant weakness is the "basic plastic whistle carved from driftwood," an jarring internal inconsistency that undermines the established ancient, timeless atmosphere.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates considerable skill in weaving disparate elements into a cohesive, atmospheric whole, despite the aforementioned inconsistency with the object. The narrative feels deliberate and achieves thematic depth within its constraints.</comment>
