<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (curiosity, seeking journals) is clear but lacks depth; the mortician acts as a necessary vessel for the plot rather than a fully realized individual with a distinct voice or complex internal landscape revealed through their actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent with a clear beginning-middle-end arc achieved within the word count. The core action (imitate) effectively drives the narrative forward through the method (footprints), though the resolution feels slightly abrupt after the build-up.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth setting is powerfully evoked with strong sensory details and atmosphere ('loudly serene' spirits, gnarled roots). The timeframe and object are well-integrated, significantly enhancing the story's mood and mystical feel.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong use of imagery and symbolism (bracelet, journals, footprints) creates impact and explores themes of knowledge, ephemerality, and consequence. The central conflict is clear, and the ending offers a purposeful, albeit slightly explicit, reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While featuring some fresh metaphors, the prose occasionally leans towards the ornate ("sky's ink bled," "rustle of revelation"). The foreign word "芦苇" feels incongruous without context, potentially disrupting flow. Generally avoids cliché but doesn't achieve groundbreaking originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its disparate elements into a cohesive, atmospheric whole. The brief length feels suitable for the vignette style, leaving the reader with a lingering sense of mystery and the ephemeral nature of revelation.</comment>
