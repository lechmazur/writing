<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character feels underdeveloped; "underestimated rebel" is stated but not shown. Motivation related to loss and brother is clear, but the "primed for wonder" aspect feels tacked on. The knife connection is interesting but doesn't fully flesh out a distinct personality or voice beyond reacting to the situation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot achieves a basic arc (inciting incident, confrontation, resolution) within the word limit, but feels rushed. The brother's explanation is overly expository, and the resolution via recipe incantations strains credulity even within the established fantasy rules. Coherence is maintained, but lacks depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The integration of the specific Korean food sensory details into the haunted house setting creates a unique and evocative atmosphere. The "ephemeral gloom" is well-realized, effectively blending decay with poignant food memories. This is a significant strength.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Strong use of food-related imagery and symbolism (knife, mirrors, gochujang). The core conflict is clear. However, some phrasing borders on purple prose ("rusted silence," "adaptation's bitter aftertaste lingering, alive"), and the theme of adaptation feels somewhat explicitly stated rather than purely shown. Emotional impact is present but slightly undercut by heavy-handed moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The central conceit blending Korean cuisine, family memory, and supernatural horror is highly original. Metaphors are generally effective, though not consistently groundbreaking. While avoiding obvious AI tells, some emotional beats and thematic statements feel slightly formulaic or overly neat rather than deeply nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story attempts to weave numerous elements together, with the food/knife/memory connection being the most successful. However, the sheer density of concepts (rebel, specific knife, adaptation, food magic, ghosts, family loss) within the word count makes some elements feel forced or superficial. It feels more like an exercise in incorporating prompts than a fully organic narrative.</comment>
