<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Motivation towards reconciliation/atonement is clear, but the 'cryptic crossword creator' aspect feels poorly integrated and doesn't significantly shape actions beyond a tenuous key/cipher link.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot effectively uses the core action (rewriting diaries) to create a complete narrative arc within the word limit, establishing cause/effect, though pacing feels slightly abrupt during the ghost's dissipation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Excellent atmospheric creation through the synergistic use of setting (whisper collection point) and timeframe (starless night), enhanced by strong sensory details (smell, sound, sight); the 'noble chaos' tone is less realised than the pervasive eerie melancholy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance (reconciliation, atonement) and effective use of symbolism (keys, diaries), creating impact. However, the prose occasionally veers into slightly excessive ornamentation, slightly dulling the overall sharpness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The core concept offers originality, but the execution relies on some familiar tropes (haunted place, tormented protagonist) and slightly overwrought, albeit atmospheric, language that sometimes lacks the freshness of truly top-tier literary fiction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of most elements creates a strong atmospheric vignette with a compelling central idea; however, the 'crossword creator' detail feels extraneous, slightly undermining the overall sense of deliberate narrative construction.</comment>
