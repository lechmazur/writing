<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The gardener's motivation (understanding emotions) is clear and drives his actions post-discovery, but his backstory feels compressed and stated rather than organically revealed, slightly weakening the depth of his 'stunted' emotions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot structure is remarkably effective for the word count, achieving a clear arc from discovery to resolution. The purse discovery and its 'flicker' effectively initiate the plot, and the silent retreat provides a coherent mechanism for the climax. Pacing is well-managed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The atmosphere of quiet longing and unspoken connection is well-established. The juxtaposition of the garden and the silent retreat works, but the 'universal translation center' setting feels slightly overly convenient or allegorical. Sensory details are present but lack consistent, striking sharpness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully uses symbolism (purse, roots, embroidery) to explore subtextual themes of shared wounds and non-verbal communication, achieving genuine emotional resonance. However, the final ironic realization is stated a bit too explicitly, slightly lessening the impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While avoiding overtly formulaic prose or obvious AI tells, the language occasionally borders on overly lyrical ("silk threads shimmered," "cacophony of belonging"). The integration of the attribute "regularly random" feels somewhat forced and awkward. Emotion is handled better than mere statement, but nuance could be deeper.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong cohesion, weaving most assigned elements effectively into a resonant narrative. The brevity feels purposeful, enhancing the theme of unspoken depth. It leaves a lingering sense of connection and shared vulnerability, indicating creative synthesis.</comment>
