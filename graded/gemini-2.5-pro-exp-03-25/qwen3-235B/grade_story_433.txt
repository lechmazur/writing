<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The "hardheaded" trait is demonstrated, but "wholeheartedly broken" feels asserted rather than fully embodied; the motivation shifts from seeking solace to seeking prophecy somewhat abruptly, lacking nuanced transition. The internal state is described more than shown through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a discernible arc within the word limit, driven by the discovery of the prophecy. However, the transition from seeking solace to actively pursuing potentially dangerous knowledge feels slightly underdeveloped, impacting the logical flow of motivation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The ephemeral ice gallery setting is vividly realized and effectively synergizes with the "snow days" timeframe and themes of transience and reckoning. Sensory details are strong, creating a compelling, albeit melancholic, atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong use of imagery and symbolism (dissolving sculpture, fractured reflection) creates impact. The central theme of paying the price is clear. However, the prose occasionally strains for effect ("exhale light," "quiet audacity," "demure audacity"), slightly undermining the emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>While the ice gallery offers originality, the core narrative (haunted past, seeking prophecy, accepting a cost) leans on familiar tropes. Some phrasing feels overly literary or self-consciously poetic ("demure audacity," "coiled around their ribs"). Emotional nuance is present but sometimes stated ("raw, wholehearted brokenness").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story integrates its elements reasonably well, particularly setting and theme. The brevity suits the vignette style. However, the slightly forced poeticism and the underdeveloped motivational shift prevent it from feeling truly seamless or achieving elite literary quality.</comment>
