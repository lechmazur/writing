<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The character concept is strong and evocative (outlaw cowboy poet), but motivation feels slightly split between challenging industrialists and a more abstract desire to 'unmake'. His defining 'peculiar ability' is well-integrated into the action, though his internal state ('frayed conscience') is more told than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc within the word limit: arrival, observation, intervention (misalignment via rewriting), and escape. The method (reading walls -> rewriting play) links well. Cause and effect are clear, and pacing is effective for a short piece, achieving a sense of resonant incompletion fitting the character.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The steampunk observatory setting is vividly realized ("brass-gear," "clockwork sun," "gears grinding") and fused effectively with the mysterious atmosphere (shifting text walls, runic dice). The setting directly facilitates the action (rewriting on walls) and enhances the core conflict (art vs. industry).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of evocative language and symbolism (dice, walls, play). The story effectively 'shows' the impact of the poet's actions on the actors and implies wider consequences, creating subtext around truth, control, and artistic rebellion. The ending feels purposeful, reinforcing the theme of transient disruption.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The blend of genres (Western, Steampunk, Magical Realism) feels relatively original. While archetypes exist (outlaw, industrialists), the specific execution (cowboy poet, runic dice, shifting text) avoids clich√©. Language is mostly fresh, though occasional phrases ("iron-fisted rule") lean towards the common. Sensory details are specific and well-integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates disparate elements into a cohesive and atmospheric whole. The assigned components feel mostly organic to the narrative rather than forced inclusions. The brevity works, creating a snapshot that implies a larger world and ongoing struggle, leaving a distinct impression.</comment>
