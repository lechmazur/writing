<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The motivation to expose illusions is clear, but the 'cook' aspect feels underutilized and slightly incongruous with the complex decoding and sabotage actions; her skills seem to materialize without strong connection to her stated role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a surprisingly complete arc within the word limit, driven effectively by the 'subvert' action and notch analysis; however, the transition from discovery to final confrontation feels somewhat condensed, impacting the logical flow slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of the mundane kitchen and high-tech seismology creates a uniquely atmospheric setting, enhanced by evocative sensory details (iron/static broth). The 'centuries of dust' timeframe deepens the sense of hidden history effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (stick, eraser, dust) and evocative imagery elevates the narrative beyond a simple conspiracy plot. The central theme of engineered chaos versus natural order is compelling, and the ending, while abrupt, offers thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The core concept and the blend of elements (seismology, cooking, historical conspiracy, folk magic via the stick) feel original. While some phrases border on the ornate ("arithmetic of deception"), it largely avoids clich√© and maintains a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive, atmospheric whole, using the constraints to create a focused narrative. The brevity feels purposeful, delivering a dense, thought-provoking piece where elements largely serve the story's unique concept.</comment>
