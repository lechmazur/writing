<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The character's core attribute ("infuriatingly calm") is asserted rather than effectively demonstrated; the motivation ("final stand") feels introduced late and slightly incongruous with the earlier drive to resurrect genius.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The plot structure suffers from abrupt pacing, particularly the sudden success after millennia of failure; the mechanism connecting keys, grids, and talents remains highly abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The setting concept ("probability mapping center") is intriguing but lacks vivid, grounding detail beyond the immediate chamber; the assigned tone ("fractured grace") is present but inconsistently maintained.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>While avoiding blatant clich√©s, the narrative relies on somewhat abstract high-concept language that skirts purple prose and lacks deep emotional nuance, feeling slightly formulaic in its structure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story shows ambition in integrating disparate elements, but the cohesion feels strained, particularly regarding character attribute and motivation; the concept outshines the execution.</comment>
