<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The guide's initial 'unsettled' state and motivation to 'outrun prophecy' are clear drivers, but the 'accidentally heroic' attribute feels like a label applied retrospectively at the resolution rather than a trait developed through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot coheres around the 'align' action and puzzle box within the tight structure, but the 'through reversed wishes' method is conceptually vague and its mechanical integration into the cause-and-effect chain feels forced and unclear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The seashell setting and architectural secrets create a strong, unique atmosphere with effective sensory details, but the specified 'sharp gentleness' tone is unbalanced; the narrative heavily emphasizes 'sharp' uncanniness, with 'gentleness' feeling marginal and confined primarily to the end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Features striking imagery, effective symbolism (box, shell), and explores themes of fate/consequence, but occasionally risks overwritten prose and the thematic resolution via the mirror chamber feels slightly abstract in its execution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High originality in the core concept (seashell architecture, box-key), avoiding obvious AI patterns and clich√©s, though some descriptive phrases ("skeletal light," "petrified scream") feel self-consciously literary rather than entirely organic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Demonstrates creativity in combining most elements into a cohesive, atmospheric whole, but overall publishability is hampered by the weak, forced integration of key assigned elements like the 'reversed wish' method and the underdeveloped 'accidental heroism'.</comment>
