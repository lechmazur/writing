<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's core (dream thief, fragmented self) is compelling and drives her actions; however, the "mathematically challenged" attribute feels more like a convenient plot device than a deeply integrated or revealing trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear and satisfying arc with an effective climax ("plunge") well-suited to the tight word limit; coherence and pacing are strong.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere of desolation and lingering humanity is powerfully evoked by the synergy of setting and timeframe; sensory details are generally effective, though some imagery like "decaying books" is somewhat standard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Story achieves significant emotional impact and thematic depth, particularly with its poignant ending; however, a few emotional states or character qualities like "quiet mania" are stated directly rather than purely shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The core concept of a dream thief creating a psychic echo is highly original and avoids AI-like predictability; while generally well-written, a few descriptive phrases are functional rather than exceptionally fresh or striking (e.g., "only real tool").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The assigned elements are woven together with remarkable cohesion into a memorable and thought-provoking narrative, making the brief length feel impactful and deliberate, showcasing creative synthesis.</comment>
