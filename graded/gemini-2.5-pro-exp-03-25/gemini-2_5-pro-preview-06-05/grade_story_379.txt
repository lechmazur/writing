<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "trickster lawyer" is effective, but the "penance" motivation and "impatiently patient" attribute are more asserted than deeply explored or demonstrated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear mini-arc driven by the diversion, but the "chosen paths" theme feels more like an explicit statement than an organic plot influence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Inventive core misdirection, but clich√©d phrasing ("sharp and familiar") and a somewhat tropey antagonist setup slightly mar originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Intelligent and tense narrative, but thematic layers could be more subtly woven, and some elements need more freshness for top-tier distinction.</comment>
