<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Character's core confusion and evolving motivation are compelling; the "boldly timid" attribute is well-realized in the climax, though its presence could be subtly deepened earlier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong arc and pacing with a clever subversion of the "liberalize" mission; the predecessor's direct clue about the birds slightly tempers the organic nature of the central discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exceptionally evocative setting ("eerie salt mine," "crystalline society") that strongly supports the theme of an isolated ecosystem and the character's observational method.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Achieves a distinct, thoughtful voice with fresh metaphors ("counterpoint of hearts"), largely avoiding formulaic pitfalls and showcasing nuanced emotional progression.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and thought-provoking; assigned elements are masterfully integrated, creating a resonant piece that feels deliberate and complete within its brevity.</comment>
