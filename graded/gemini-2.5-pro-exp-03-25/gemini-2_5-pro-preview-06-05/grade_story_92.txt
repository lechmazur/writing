<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear motivation and a distinct narrative voice are strengths; however, the protagonist's "hollow space" feels somewhat explicitly stated rather than deeply explored or subtly shown, slightly diminishing profound character depth for the highest tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story presents a coherent reflective arc with an effectively integrated flashback; the "plot" itself is minimal, focusing on internal justification rather than significant unfolding external events in the present moment, which suits the vignette style.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The world-building is exceptionally immersive, rich in specific sensory details that vivify the atmosphere; a minor point is the use of a slightly conventional descriptor like "grim windows" amidst otherwise fresh imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A unique premise and potent literary devices (e.g., "waxy petals like sleeping mouths") create a memorable mood and subtext; a few descriptive phrases, while vivid, risk their "crafted" nature being slightly too conspicuous for seamless subtlety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The concept is highly original, effectively subverting the haunted house trope with a distinct authorial voice; the writing avoids AI-like tells and genericism, showcasing stylistic individuality, though its polish is, rarely, noticeable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Impressive cohesion and creative synthesis of elements result in a polished and resonant vignette; for the absolute highest echelon of publication, the emotional and thematic depth could be even more subtly profound, leaving a stronger lingering impact.</comment>
