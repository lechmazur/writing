<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Weakness: Character depth is limited; Elias's transformation feels more intellectual than deeply emotional within the scope, and traits are asserted more than shown with nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Weakness: Plot relies on a conventional puzzle-chain structure; the core "synthesize" action is not fully integrated as an active process until the climax.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Weakness: Though coherent in its assembly of elements, the story doesn't transcend its components to achieve exceptional literary merit or a lingering sense of originality.</comment>
