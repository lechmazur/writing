<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The character's 'tragically joyful' attribute is deeply and effectively woven into his perspective and reactions, and the first-person voice is distinct and consistent; motivation is clear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The assigned "method" (calligraphy) is not plausibly the method of the central "action" (weatherize) nor of the council's broader scheme; it's used as a strained simile for thoughts, weakening plot coherence regarding this constraint. Otherwise, the story arc is clear and pacing effective for the length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The atmosphere supports the core themes, and sensory details are evocative. However, the "steam-powered" aspect of the setting feels somewhat underdeveloped and not fully integrated beyond a mention.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a strong emotional impact and thematic depth, primarily through its unique perspective and skillful use of metaphor and symbolism; the central conflict is poignant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise of a telepathic statue is original, and many metaphors are fresh. However, the awkward, non-literal integration of the "calligraphy" method feels like a workaround for a constraint rather than organic storytelling, bordering on an AI-like forced connection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story is largely cohesive and emotionally resonant, with creative use of most elements. The main detraction is the problematic integration of the "method" element, which feels forced rather than serving the narrative organically.</comment>
