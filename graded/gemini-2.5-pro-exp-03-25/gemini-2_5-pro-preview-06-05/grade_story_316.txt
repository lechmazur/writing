<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Key descriptors like "seraphic" feel unearned and "unapologetically timid" is clunky, weakening an otherwise clear motivation and fitting skill-based resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong, coherent arc with a clever central revelation, slightly marred by a convenient plot device (the photo discovery) for the highest tier of publication.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Highly evocative atmosphere, especially in the arcade; however, the "Doric columns" in a factory town setting feel somewhat arbitrary without more specific grounding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original central concept (scoreboard blueprint) and strong thematic resonance are achieved through well-integrated metaphors and a satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The core idea (scoreboard as blueprint) is notably original; however, persistent lyrical phrasing and descriptors like "seraphic" occasionally border on stylistic affectation rather than pure substance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Impressive cohesion and creative utilization of disparate elements, though minor stylistic choices and one plot convenience prevent flawless execution demanded at the highest level.</comment>
