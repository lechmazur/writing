<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and pacing adequate for the length, but the magical resolution (firefly skywriting from a "hum") is overly convenient, lacking a deeper narrative inevitability.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While disparate elements combine into an inventive and cohesive vignette, the piece ultimately lacks the exceptional depth or flawless execution demanded by the highest literary standards.</comment>
