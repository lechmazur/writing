<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's core paradox is compelling and well-explored; the assigned attribute "objectively personal" feels somewhat imposed rather than organically integrated into personality or action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Clear internal arc to concession within the tight word limit; the "daydream loop" as method is more an internal process revealing the path to concession than an active plot driver.</comment>
