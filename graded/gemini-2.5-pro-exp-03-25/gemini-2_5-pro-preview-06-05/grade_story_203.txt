<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and compelling; the "stage fright" attribute is functional, but its introduction ("familiar paralysis of stage fright creeping in") is slightly more told than shown, despite being supported by other details.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story presents a strong, coherent arc with effective pacing for its length; the central action drives the plot, and the ritualistic trigger (key sound) is accepted within the narrative's established internal logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The "orbital debris-scavenged workshop" setting is highly evocative, creating a potent atmosphere that, through contrast with the "green Earth" memory, powerfully supports the story's themes and emotional core using well-chosen sensory details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative achieves significant thematic depth and emotional impact, primarily through effective symbolism (wildflowers, water) and a well-crafted progression, though the ghost's single line of dialogue is functional rather than deeply revelatory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The core concept—a sci-fi exorcism rooted in familial deceit—offers a refreshing genre blend and the prose is generally strong and specific, though a few minor descriptive elements (e.g., ghost dissipating "like breaking glass") tread familiar ground.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A cohesive and impactful story where constrained elements are skillfully interwoven to enhance thematic resonance and narrative focus, resulting in a potent short piece that feels complete and deliberately concise.</comment>
