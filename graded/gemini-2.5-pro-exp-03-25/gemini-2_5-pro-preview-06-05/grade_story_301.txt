<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Alistair's motivation ("cosmic wonder") is stated clearly but remains abstract; his "ethically questionable" nature is demonstrated, yet his philosophical justification feels somewhat superficial for the profound act undertaken.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc from intent to initial outcome within the word limit; however, the depicted consequences (minor behavioral oddities) feel somewhat disproportionate to the grand claim of "fundamentally breaking" reality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The "jazz age time capsule" effectively creates an isolated, anachronistic atmosphere; yet, the specific "Jazz Age" details feel more like evocative set dressing than elements deeply intertwined with the character's core philosophy or method.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story possesses strong conceptual impact and employs literary devices effectively (e.g., knitting as "weaving intent"); the ending declares a "new, beautifully illogical age" with a satisfying finality, though the "irrevocably" is more asserted than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The core premise of subtly impairing logic via ancient codes is original and engaging; however, the initial exposition of Alistair's grand plan contains some slightly repetitive phrasing of the central idea.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates excellent cohesion, creatively integrating its assigned elements into a thought-provoking narrative; it effectively leaves the reader pondering the nature of reality, though the philosophical link between the induced chaos and "cosmic wonder" could be more deeply explored.</comment>
