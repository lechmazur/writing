<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pip's melancholy is well-realized, but the "jester" attribute feels underutilized in his primary actions; Eva is a functional, if somewhat standard, skeptical captain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Efficient plot progression, yet the revelatory accident feels somewhat convenient, and the core theme is stated a bit too explicitly for highest literary merit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (paint fumes) create a strong mood, though the "steampunk" aspect of the setting lacks deep, distinctive integration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The premise offers a striking originality through its unusual combination of elements, though character reactions occasionally tread familiar emotional pathways.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Commendable cohesion of disparate elements into an imaginative vignette, but lacks the seamless, inevitable feel of truly top-tier flawless work.</comment>
