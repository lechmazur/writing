<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The 'feisty stablehand' past feels superficially tacked on, more told than shown in her current role; motivation is clear but its evolution is very rapid and convenient for the plot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Efficient arc for its length, but the ticket-based resolution feels a touch too convenient and whimsical, slightly at odds with the established technological milieu.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Setting details are evocative (e.g., "chaotic bubble of welded space debris") and create necessary thematic contrast, though some broader world elements are standard sci-fi shorthand.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Presents a strong thematic message and uses some good imagery (e.g., "soul of an old fire married to the science of the stars"), but the supposedly 'cryptic' phrase is overly direct, and key descriptive phrases are repeated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Blends familiar tropes with a modicum of freshness in its specific execution, but doesn't break significant new ground; prose quality is solid but not consistently exceptional or highly distinctive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>A competent and cohesive miniature that integrates most elements well, but lacks the exceptional spark or flawless execution demanded for top-tier publication; the 'feisty stablehand' element feels under-integrated.</comment>
