<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The pivot from "profoundly submissive" to decisive, risky action, while narratively driven by empathy, feels somewhat abrupt for such a deeply ingrained trait without more subtle foreshadowing of this latent capacity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a remarkable coherence and a complete arc within the concise word limit; the cause-and-effect progression from eavesdropping to decisive action is clear and compelling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of the mundane manor setting with the clandestine, sterile workshop creates an effective atmospheric contrast that heightens the story's tension and Alistair's unusual situation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story effectively uses Alistair's feigned incompetence as a tool for heroism, and the final line delivers a satisfying thematic resonance regarding purpose; imagery like "flimsy totem of his own gilded cage" is strong.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the execution has charm, the "bumbling but secretly capable aristocrat" archetype and some repetitive adjectival choices (e.g., "frightful/ly") lean into familiar territory, slightly tempering its claims to complete originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates commendable cohesion, skillfully integrating its assigned elements into a purposeful narrative; Alistair's quiet triumph offers a genuinely satisfying, if somewhat anticipated, resolution.</comment>
