<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is defined more by direct authorial statements of 'rebel' status and motivation ("underestimated rebel," "motivation was simple") than by consistently subtle revelation through purely organic action or deep interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the core concept "art of adaptation" is explicitly stated rather than fully embodied; the 'method' (cuisine) is a clever communication trigger rather than the method of the primary action (escape).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, effectively contrasting the "manufactured dread" with the "hopeful dark." The setting is well-chosen and integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Story shows strong craft with impactful imagery (cuisine as a map) and a satisfying emotional arc; however, overt statements of theme and motivation slightly reduce the subtextual depth expected at the highest tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality, especially with the 'five-spice powder' code, and avoids most formulaic pitfalls. However, some core emotional drivers are stated with a directness that feels somewhat constructed ("prime a stagnant heart").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated to create an engaging vignette. The narrative is clear and purposeful, though a greater reliance on showing versus telling key thematic concepts would elevate its literary sophistication.</comment>
