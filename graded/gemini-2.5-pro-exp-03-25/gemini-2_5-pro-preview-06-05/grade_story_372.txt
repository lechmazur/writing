<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's 'spy' facet is less developed than 'lovelorn'; Anya's chillingly indifferent motivation is a significant strength.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot is coherent, but the assigned 'method' (urban exploration) is only an indirect historical context for the 'action' (gloat), not its direct mechanism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is strong and consistent, but world-building leans on familiar cyberpunk tropes rather than forging unique details.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Antagonist's 'curiously indifferent' nature is original, but some standard genre tropes and phrases slightly diminish overall freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Highly polished and cohesive, but narrowly misses groundbreaking originality needed for top-tier publication by adhering closely to genre conventions.</comment>
