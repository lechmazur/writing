<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation is strong and consistent; the 'spiritually secular' attribute justifies the divination method, but the *extent* of insight gained via coffee stains (pinpointing a specific archive and its superweapon-map nature) feels more like a convenient plot mechanism than a deeply explored character facet.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a commendable arc and coherence within the word limit, but the crucial plot turn hinges on coffee stains revealing extraordinarily specific intelligence (the exact archive, its contents as a superweapon map), which strains plausibility and feels like a narrative shortcut rather than an organic development.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The derelict spaceport setting and the pervasive 'fractal sorrow' tone are exceptionally well-realized, creating a potent atmosphere that strongly supports the character's motivation and the story's themes of loss and difficult choices. Sensory details are evocative and immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Craft is generally high, with effective use of literary devices and a compelling central conflict. The ending is purposeful. However, the story relies on the protagonist 'seeing' the entire enemy plan in coffee grounds, which lessens the impact of her deduction or investigation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose avoids overt clich√© and purple passages, with some fresh metaphors ("fractal sorrow"). The 'superweapon map' is a somewhat generic trope, and its discovery via coffee-stain divination, while tied to character, feels overly convenient, lacking the nuanced uncertainty of truly original plotting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates considerable skill in weaving its assigned elements into a cohesive and emotionally resonant narrative, particularly for its length. The core dilemma is compelling, though the mechanism of revelation for the critical threat (superweapon map) borders on narrative expediency, slightly undermining flawless execution.</comment>
