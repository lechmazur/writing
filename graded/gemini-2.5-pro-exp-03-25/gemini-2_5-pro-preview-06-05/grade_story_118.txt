<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct but "hive-mind" aspect feels underdeveloped; motivation clear, yet "merry bitterness" could be woven more subtly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Core psychic cleansing plot is coherent; "bold discovery" frame, however, feels like an external, less integrated urgency device.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Nexus room atmosphere is evocative; broader "secret agent facility" setting remains generic, lacking deeper atmospheric integration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Commendable creative cohesion, yet the "bold discovery" feels more like a fulfilled constraint than an organically enriching element to the core narrative.</comment>
