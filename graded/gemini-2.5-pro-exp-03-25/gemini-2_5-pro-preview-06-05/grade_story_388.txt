<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "melodic sculptor" label feels somewhat superficial; while motivation is clear, the "sculptor" nuance isn't deeply integrated into his core conflict or resolution beyond a final simile.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Standard but effective plot arc for a short piece; achieves completeness and maintains coherence well within the word limit, though the "sudden road trip" is a convenient trope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Evocative atmosphere, with "shouting silence" as a powerful motif; sensory details effectively immerse, though some descriptive phrases ("bruised violet and soft rose") are common.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Achieves emotional resonance and thematic clarity; literary devices are well-employed, though the final realization ("he had simply forgotten how to listen") is slightly too explicit for the highest tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Core concept of plant-music is original, but some phrasing ("melodic sculptor," common poeticisms like "dew-kissed") slightly undermines full authenticity, feeling a touch writerly or predictable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>A cohesive and thoughtful story with memorable imagery; successfully integrates its elements but some stylistic choices and minor tropes prevent it from reaching "flawless."</comment>
