<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The "stamp collector" aspect feels superficial and not deeply integrated with the core quest for magic; however, the character's internal transformation driven by the motivation and object is clear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>A clear and coherent arc for a short piece, but the plot relies heavily on an internal epiphany rather than external events, and some setting elements feel more atmospheric than plot-driving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The carnival setting offers good thematic contrast and atmosphere, but its unique "bicycle-powered" characteristic feels somewhat underdeveloped in its impact on the narrative beyond a final detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance and effective use of symbolism, particularly Lyra's quote and the luggage tag; however, some expressions lean towards familiar tropes (e.g., "struck with the force of a physical blow").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The core concept of magic as connection and self-offering is original and thoughtfully explored, subverting typical "power-seeking" narratives effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a strong thematic cohesion and an emotionally resonant conclusion, effectively using most elements, though minor points slightly detract from flawless execution.</comment>
