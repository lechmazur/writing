<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong thematic arc for Azrael; initial "hollowness" could be shown more viscerally before the purposeful turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Effective mini-arc and pacing; manuscript's perfect thematic fit feels slightly too convenient for a top-tier literary piece.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Highly original core concept; the perfectly apt manuscript, while integrated, touches on a familiar trope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Poignant and largely cohesive; overt thematic exposition via the manuscript slightly undermines ultimate literary subtlety.</comment>
