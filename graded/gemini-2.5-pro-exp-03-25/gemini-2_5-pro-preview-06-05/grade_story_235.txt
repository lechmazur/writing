<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character traits like "herbalist" feel superficially applied rather than deeply integrated into Kaelen's persona or worldview beyond justifying the plot device. Elara lacks significant agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The core plot mechanic (meteor-to-flower decoding) lacks internal logic or grounding, feeling arbitrary and weakening overall coherence despite a clear narrative arc.</comment>
