<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong core motivation linked to trauma and heritage, but the "artfully clumsy" attribute feels more like a convenient plot device than a deeply integrated character facet.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc for a short piece; however, the mirror's unusual ability relies on a thin "ancient silvering" explanation, weakening its plausibility for literary fiction without a fuller embrace of the fantastical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The abandoned terminal setting offers strong symbolic resonance with the themes, but the "screaming silence" is more an internal character state than an overall narrative tone, and sensory details could be more uniquely evocative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The central concept of the funhouse mirror as a truth-divining tool is highly original and impactful; however, some literary phrasing (e.g., "light through darkness") dips into clich√©, and the dialogue is functional rather than exceptional.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the core method is inventive, the story utilizes familiar archetypes (traumatized vet, corrupt contractors) and the "ancient art" feels somewhat asserted rather than fully embodied, limiting its overall originality beyond the central conceit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story creatively integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with a memorable central image, yet doesn't quite achieve the "flawless" polish and depth in execution required for top-tier publication.</comment>
