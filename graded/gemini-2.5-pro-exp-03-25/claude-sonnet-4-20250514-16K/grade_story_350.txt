<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The puppeteer attribute is functionally well-integrated, but Marcusâ€™s lifelong obsession ("consumed his life") lacks visceral depth beyond statement; his profound inner world remains somewhat inferred rather than fully illuminated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The core plot of discovery is sound, but the "puzzle event" as an immediate catalyst feels inadequately connected to the pre-existing, life-consuming quest tied to the album, creating an abrupt and superficial inciting link. The remodeling itself is very rapidly achieved.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The ancient temple's atmosphere is richly evoked with strong sensory details, creating a palpable sense of mystery. However, the "puzzle event" introduces a slightly dissonant, modern-feeling note not seamlessly woven into the timeless setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The central metaphor of the gown's tears transforming the temple's acoustics is strikingly original and intellectually stimulating. The concluding thematic sentence, however, feels somewhat didactic and the repetition of "irritatingly perfect" for "patience" is awkward.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates high originality in its central mechanism of revelation (acoustic remodeling via gown patterns). However, it leans on the "hidden map in old object" trope, and the thematic echo of "irritatingly perfect" in the conclusion feels a little self-conscious.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative showcases impressive creativity in synthesizing disparate elements into a largely cohesive whole. The primary weakness is the integration of the "puzzle event," which feels more like an external prompt than an organic component of the core mystery, slightly marring an otherwise sophisticated construction.</comment>
