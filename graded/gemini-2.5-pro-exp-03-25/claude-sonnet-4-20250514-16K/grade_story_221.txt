<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina's internal arc and motivation are clear and compelling; however, the spirits' conveniently altered message somewhat lessens her solitary agency in the change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with effective pacing and a clear resolution; the spirits' abrupt, supportive change of song feels a bit too opportune as a plot device.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The abandoned gallery is an evocative, symbolic setting, enhancing the theme of decaying tradition, though its specific connection to solemn remembrance is initially unusual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (amber, barnacles) and lyrical prose creates significant impact and emotional depth; minor moments verge on over-explaining established metaphors.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh combination of specific elements (ghost-whispering diver, amber); while the underlying "breaking from family expectations" theme is common, its execution feels distinctive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative is impressively cohesive, artfully integrating its assigned elements into a thematically resonant vignette that achieves a strong sense of completeness.</comment>
