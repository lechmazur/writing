<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct voice and clear motivation, but the "submissive" aspect feels somewhat underutilized in the direct conflict resolution; charm outweighs profound depth for this demanding standard.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Clever resolution and clear arc, but the core premise (MI6 rabbit termination) and convenient character access to a secure area strain credulity expected for flawless work.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Setting serves plot mechanics (e.g., acoustics for eavesdropping), but lacks deep sensory immersion and relies on some convenient environmental features rather than organic world-building.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong originality in character concept and witty prose, largely avoiding formulaic pitfalls, though the "intelligent animal" element, while handled with charm, borders on whimsical convenience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Creative combination of elements and undeniable charm, but lacks the rigorous plausibility and consistent depth expected for flawless literary work aspiring to the highest echelon.</comment>
