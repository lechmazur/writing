<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Celestine's "grandiose modesty" and unique methods are well-portrayed, and her voice is distinct; the assigned motivation "to learn forgotten songs" is present as an ongoing professional necessity, though her immediate plot motivation is problem-solving.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot is concise and coherent, with the "weirdly static" attribute creating a clear initial problem that Celestine's "choreographing" action resolves effectively within a satisfying arc for the word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "floating tea platform" and "recycling period" synergize to create a vivid, ethereal atmosphere; sensory details are generally strong, though the platform itself could have even more unique texturing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves significant impact through its original core concept and effective use of symbolism (reversed songs, wine bottles), exploring themes of memory and perspective in a memorable way.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The central premise is highly original; however, a few descriptive phrases verge on the familiar (e.g., "weathered hands trembled"), and the explicit repetition of "grandiose modesty" slightly weakens the subtlety of its portrayal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The assigned elements are woven together with impressive cohesiveness and creativity, resulting in a story that feels purposeful and leaves a lingering sense of gentle magic and wisdom.</comment>
