<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's dual motivations (pleasing the rich vs. braving supernatural fear) for his "carefully careless" nature aren't seamlessly integrated; the latter is far more compelling and better executed than the initial, somewhat superficial justification.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot is more an atmospheric vignette than a narrative dynamically driven by the assigned "justify" action; the "blood drive" method serves as functional backstory but lacks significant impact on the present tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric creation through vivid, multi-sensory details and a powerful synergy between the haunted setting, the specific timeframe, and the pervasive "loud silence" tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High storytelling impact achieved through masterful "showing" rather than telling, potent imagery (especially the sentient botanical elements), and strong subtext regarding unspoken rules and coexistence with the uncanny.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the personified botanical horror and the protagonist's stoic, "carefully careless" response, offering a fresh take within the somewhat familiar haunted house framework; writing avoids AI tells.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves strong cohesion and a lingering, unsettling mood, creatively integrating most elements; however, a few assigned components feel more like constraints fulfilled than organically indispensable parts of the core narrative.</comment>
