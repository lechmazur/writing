<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a neat arc, but the inciting incident is a somewhat convenient mechanism, and the overall progression, while logical, lacks surprising turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The atmosphere is well-evoked with fitting sensory details, though the "cave school" setting, while functional, doesn't quite achieve a breathtakingly original sense of place.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates commendable cohesion in integrating its elements, presenting a complete vignette, though it doesn't quite reach a level of profound, lingering impact or startling innovation.</comment>
