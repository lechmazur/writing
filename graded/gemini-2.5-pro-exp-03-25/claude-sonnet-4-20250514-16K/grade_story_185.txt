<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation and talents are strongly integrated, but the "infuriatingly calm" attribute is more asserted than explored in its full impact or nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a clear arc and effective pacing, but the climactic reality-rewrite feels somewhat abstract and too rapidly achieved for its immense scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The conceptual blend is highly original, yet the prose occasionally risks "purple" passages and its stylistic intensity can feel self-consciously mannered rather than authentically artful.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Ambitious and thematically cohesive, but stylistic choices (ornate language, repetition) and the sheer scale of resolution within such brevity strain perfect execution.</comment>
