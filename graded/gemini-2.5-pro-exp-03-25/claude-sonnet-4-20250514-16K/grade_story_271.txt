<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Marlowe's motivation is stated but character depth and the emotional arc for both figures feel somewhat underdeveloped for profound impact, relying on asserted traits over fully demonstrated complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The assigned "method" (scent of spices) is passively atmospheric, not an active plot driver, weakening structural integrity; the narrative arc, while complete, is quite simple for its thematic ambition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>A strong core concept and palpable atmosphere are ultimately overshadowed by underdeveloped character arcs and a lack of subtlety in delivering its otherwise poignant message, preventing it from reaching top-tier quality.</comment>
