<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong, resonant motivation tied to the photograph and past guilt; the 'serendipitously stubborn' attribute is integrated but feels slightly clunky as a descriptor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot achieves a tight, satisfying arc of revelation and resolve within the word limit; the key informational reveal through the maintenance worker is functional but a little convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative lunar greenhouse setting powerfully contrasts with internal turmoil and external threats; atmosphere strongly supports the 'serene anger' tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Impactful ending showcasing resolved purpose, and effective use of imagery; a few phrases ("crystallized into focus," "wove themselves into truth") lean on common idioms, slightly dulling linguistic sharpness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Emotional core feels authentic and human, avoiding AI-like detachment; the narrative relies on some familiar tropes (corrupt superior, avenging family) without offering significant subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Impressive cohesion integrating diverse assigned elements into a compelling and emotionally resonant narrative; while very well-executed, it doesn't quite reach the exceptional originality or profound thematic depth demanded for flawless, top-tier publication.</comment>
