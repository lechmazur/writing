<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's internal conflict is clear, but her motivation to understand "evolutionary wisdom" feels somewhat intellectually imposed rather than arising organically from her immediate emotional turmoil post-resignation. The connection between her personal crisis and this specific abstract quest could be more viscerally established.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc, but the central epiphany regarding the "liberalization of the human spirit," derived from observing starlings, feels somewhat accelerated and overly neat for such a profound transformation, especially within the constraints of a short piece aiming for deep resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "eerie salt mine" is an evocative starting point, but the "eerie" quality is not deeply sustained or contrasted within the description of the village itself, which quickly shifts to "warm electric light" and "laughter." The potential atmospheric tension from its history feels somewhat underdeveloped in the present.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (starlings, key). However, thematic insights are sometimes explicitly stated ("sometimes the most profound wisdom...") rather than allowed to emerge entirely from subtext or Elena's unspoken realization, slightly diminishing the reader's interpretive work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>While the specific combination of elements offers originality, the narrative's tidy symbolic resolution and the somewhat familiar arc of finding new meaning after professional disillusionment can feel slightly too perfectly constructed, missing a touch of organic messiness or unpredictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creatively combines its elements. However, for the highest literary tier, its allegorical nature and the clarity of its thematic intentions might be perceived as slightly too visible, potentially sacrificing some of the nuanced ambiguity that elevates a work.</comment>
