<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Miraâ€™s defining trait is clear, but her internal landscape, particularly the sacrifice of her gift, feels somewhat glossed over; supporting characters like Pascal lean towards archetypal wisdom rather than full dimension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot is commendably tight and purposeful for its length, achieving a clear arc, though the inciting incident for Mira's integration (the vegetable spill) feels somewhat mechanically convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The 'celestial grotto' and 'living shadows' present an intriguing backdrop, yet their unique potential isn't fully mined for atmospheric depth or pervasive sensory detail, leaving the world more conceptual than immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The central chessboard symbolism is intelligently employed and the thematic message is clear; however, Pascal's direct exposition of this symbolism slightly preempts more subtle reader discovery, and dialogue is functional rather than sparkling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the narrative framework uses familiar dystopian elements (authoritarian regime, hunted individuals with special gifts), its core originality lies in the subversion of the 'single hero' trope through the distribution of power, a refreshing conceptual turn.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates a commendable ability to weave its assigned elements into a thematically coherent and ultimately uplifting narrative within its brevity, though it stops short of groundbreaking literary innovation required for the highest tier.</comment>
