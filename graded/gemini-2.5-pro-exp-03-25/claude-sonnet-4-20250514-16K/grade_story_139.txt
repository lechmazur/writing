<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and drives the character; however, the "visually unappealing" attribute is superfluous and undeveloped, while the resolution of his internal conflict feels somewhat superficial.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and effectively paced for its length, but the dream revealing "everything" about the bite pattern is a narrative convenience that slightly undermines the otherwise strong "cautious investigation" premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is exceptionally well-realized, creating a potent atmosphere that strongly supports the character's isolation, the mystical quality of his pursuit, and the narrative's tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story's central premise is unique and memorable, with effective use of imagery and symbolism; however, the ultimate reveal of the killer's identity is somewhat conventional for the genre.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The core forensic method is strikingly original, and the prose is generally purposeful, yet the narrative incorporates some familiar tropes (e.g., the outwardly righteous but inwardly corrupt leader) without significant subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong cohesion and creative integration of its core elements, achieving a compelling narrative arc within its concise form, though minor conceptual shortcuts prevent a "flawless" assessment.</comment>
