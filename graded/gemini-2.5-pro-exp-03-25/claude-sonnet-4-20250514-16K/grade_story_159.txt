<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Archetype is strong and consistent, but the transformation from "king" lacks deeper emotional resonance beyond the intellectual shift; "earnestly frivolous" is well-portrayed but the gravitas of his past feels somewhat muted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The plot serves the theme adequately, but the "grand experiment" aspect lacks depth and consequence; resolution is purely internal, making the external actions feel more symbolic than strongly plot-driving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The core setting is evocative and thematically resonant, but peripheral world details like the "nearby villages" remain generic, slightly undermining full immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Powerful central metaphors and thematic depth are evident, but the narrative occasionally resorts to overtly stating its philosophical insights, reducing subtextual richness and reader discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The core concept is commendably unique and the combination of elements is fresh. However, a few key philosophical phrases are leaned on heavily, risking a didactic rather than organic feel, and some prose borders on overly ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates significant creative ambition and thematic cohesion, but falls short of "flawless" due to a tendency towards direct thematic exposition and a character whose profound internal shift feels more asserted than deeply excavated.</comment>
