<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and consistent, but deeper psychological nuance for the "placid ferocity" attribute is somewhat underdeveloped beyond deliberate action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong coherence and pacing achieve a complete arc effectively; the antagonist's nature remains somewhat vague, slightly limiting the specificity of the threat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative atmosphere created by the unique setting blend ("ancient Persian palace reimagined" as a funeral parlor) and effective sensory details is a significant strength.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Effective use of imagery and a unique perspective create impact; thematic statements, particularly at the end, occasionally lean towards telling rather than purely showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the blend of disparate elements (Persian lore, astronomy, mortuary); however, the core antagonist type ("grief-eater") is somewhat familiar, and key thematic phrases are repeated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>High cohesion and creative integration of the assigned elements are strong; the concluding thematic statement feels slightly too explicit for the highest literary standard demanding utmost subtlety.</comment>
