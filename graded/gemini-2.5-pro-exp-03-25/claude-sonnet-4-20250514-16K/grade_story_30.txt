<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's core attribute ('philosophically practical') is asserted rather than deeply shown, limiting psychological depth despite clear motivation and integrated abilities.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and resolves neatly, but the 'flame' element acts more atmospherically than as a primary plot driver; resolution via 'cosmic chance' feels convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is strong and uniquely blended with good sensory detail, though the 'space pirate' aspect of the setting feels more implied than concretely established for the protagonist's vessel.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Evocative imagery and a clear central theme provide impact, but the conceptual premise somewhat overshadows deep character-driven emotional resonance; 'showing' could be stronger for core traits.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Originality in the conceptual blend is a strength, yet some descriptive phrases verge on the ornate, and character reasoning, while stated, lacks profound human nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements are creatively combined into a cohesive whole, but the narrative offers more conceptual satisfaction and neat thematic resolution than the profound, lingering resonance demanded by top-tier literary fiction.</comment>
