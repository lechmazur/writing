<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is vivid and his eccentric motivations are clear, but the "puppeteer" aspect feels more like a label reinforced by one phrase than a deeply integrated facet of his ongoing actions beyond general control.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a clear, albeit simple, arc for the word count; however, the main external plot resolution (watering curiosity) is asserted by the character rather than demonstrably achieved.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmospheric juxtaposition of the ancient lighthouse vigil against modern revelry is highly effective and a key strength, though some interior library descriptions lean on familiar tropes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Craft is evident in the unique premise and consistent voice, achieving a memorable whimsical effect, but the story primarily offers surface charm over deeper subtextual layers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>High originality in concept, but the consistently ornate prose, while aiming for "absurd solemnity," sometimes borders on overwrought, and the justification for the "puppeteer" element feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements are creatively and cohesively combined into a distinctive vignette, yet the narrative relies heavily on the reader's acceptance of its highly stylized, verbose expression of "absurd solemnity."</comment>
