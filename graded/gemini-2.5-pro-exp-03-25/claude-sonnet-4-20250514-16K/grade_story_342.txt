<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The 'careless' trait is superficial post-crash; the shift to 'methodical' hinges on a convenient supernatural catalyst, and the claimed 'exuberance' lacks full realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot is efficient but relies on 'borrowed memories' as an overly swift device for character transformation and problem-solving, lessening deeper conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The central mechanism of soul-archiving is notably original, largely avoiding formulaic pitfalls despite a rapid character arc driven by external influence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements combine into an imaginative narrative, but the protagonist's rapid internal shifts, while thematically justified, slightly undermine profound depth for a top-tier piece.</comment>
