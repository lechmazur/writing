<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Consistent portrayal of theatricality and clear motivation, but character lacks deeper complexity, and the "oddly seldom" character linkage is awkward.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clear, engaging arc with unique mechanics, though the "omnipotent" foe's convenient riddle-leaving slightly strains credulity for top-tier consideration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>High originality in core elements (setting, method), but the "oddly seldom" phrase feels somewhat artificially inserted, and minor character/villain tropes persist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Creatively cohesive with memorable elements, but the integration of the "oddly seldom" attribute feels slightly forced in one instance, impacting overall polish.</comment>
