<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's "softhearted champion" trait is stated more than shown; motivation is clear but lacks deep personal complexity beyond the functional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot is coherent for a vignette, but the core mechanism of fate-alteration is asserted rather than deeply explored, and impacts are told rather than shown.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and the central metaphor of stellar creation are strengths; however, thematic statements are occasionally too direct, lessening subtextual depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The blend of astrological magic with a cyberpunk setting offers a degree of originality, but the narrative still relies on some familiar genre tropes and phrasings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically resonant for a short piece, but lacks the exceptional character depth or innovative execution needed to transcend to top-tier literary quality.</comment>
