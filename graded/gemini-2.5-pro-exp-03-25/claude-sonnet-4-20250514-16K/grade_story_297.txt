<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's "professionally rebellious" trait and Mu motivation are present but lack deep, nuanced exploration within this scene; more asserted than demonstrated through distinct voice or complex internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear plot arc driven by the "quell" action, but the precipitating cause for the spirits' immediate, intense fury is underdeveloped, making the inciting incident feel somewhat arbitrary for flawless coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly realized and integral to the central action of stone tattooing; the "coffee shop" nomenclature, however, creates a slight, if intentional, dissonance with the profound spiritual events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong central theme of evolving tradition and effective use of imagery ("growing like coral"), but the consistently lyrical style lacks some dynamic range, and the main theme is explicitly stated rather than purely shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Core concept of tattooing stone is highly original, yet some descriptive phrases ("countless journeys," "ancestral power") lean on familiar mystical genre language, slightly dulling the edge of complete freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Creative synthesis of most elements is impressive, particularly the transformation of the setting; however, the "lost city" motivation feels less organically integrated into the immediate crisis and its resolution.</comment>
