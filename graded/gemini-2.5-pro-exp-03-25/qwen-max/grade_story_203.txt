<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivation ("sculpt possibility") is abstract and less compelling than the implied goal of understanding/overcoming his father's legacy. The unique stage fright is introduced but its direct impact on previous failures versus this success isn't fully dramatized. Father remains a somewhat shadowy influence defined by secrets rather than tangible interaction or deeper revealed complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc (setup, confrontation, resolution), but the climax feels abrupt. The ghost's defeat hinges on suddenly understanding unexplained words, which feels convenient rather than earned through Kael's specific actions or growth within the scene. The connection between the opening toy assembly and the exorcism is primarily ironic, not plot-driving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The orbital debris setting is highly effective, creating a strong atmosphere of isolation and decay that contrasts well with the wildflowers. However, the "amid toy assembly" timeframe feels slightly forced, adding irony but not integrating seamlessly into the core atmosphere or action beyond the opening sentence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism effectively (wildflowers, mechanical ghost) and presents a unique concept. However, the thematic realization ("inheritance of lies wasn’t just his burden—it was also his weapon") is stated rather explicitly at the end, somewhat diminishing the subtext. The emotional impact is present but constrained by the brevity and abrupt resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The core concept (space exorcist, mechanical ghost, legacy issues) is original. However, some phrasing ("discarded dreams," debris "whispering stories") borders on familiar tropes. While avoiding major AI pitfalls, the narrative flow feels slightly predictable in its setup-confrontation-epiphany structure within the constraints.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story integrates most elements cohesively, particularly the setting, object, and core concept. The primary weakness is the "toy assembly" timeframe feeling less integral. The brief length works for a focused scene, but the resolution feels slightly unearned, suggesting the constraints limited deeper exploration rather than serving a deliberate artistic choice for ambiguity.</comment>
