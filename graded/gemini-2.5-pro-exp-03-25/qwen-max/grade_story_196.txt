<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The central conflict between "fiercely apathetic" and the "spark of defiance" / motivation to "overcome" feels more asserted than convincingly portrayed; the apathy lacks tangible demonstration against the clear drive shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically from observation to action, but the initial resignation scene feels structurally disconnected from the core meteor-following narrative, weakening overall coherence within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The floating monastery setting is intriguing but lacks deep sensory immersion. The assigned "knowing naivety" tone is confined almost entirely to the description of the breakroom scene and doesn't effectively permeate the overall atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story uses standard imagery (meteors) but lacks significant subtext or emotional resonance. The craft is competent but fails to elevate the material beyond a functional narrative; the internal conflict is stated rather than shown effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Relies heavily on the "world-weary warrior" trope and employs clich√©s ("marks of countless battles," "black as midnight") without fresh perspective. The narrative lacks a distinctive voice or originality, feeling somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The elements are incorporated, but their integration feels somewhat mechanical, particularly the timeframe/tone element. The story reads as competent execution of prompts rather than an organic, inspired piece.</comment>
