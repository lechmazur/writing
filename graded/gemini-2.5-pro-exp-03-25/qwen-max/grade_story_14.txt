<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivation ("capture one last spark") is stated but lacks depth; the "naive" trait isn't convincingly demonstrated through action or dialogue. The "rarely predictable" attribute feels asserted rather than shown. The professor is a familiar archetype.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically from arrival to ritual within the word limit, achieving a basic arc. However, the connection between the "rebellious midnight lectures" method and the core action feels somewhat tenuous and expository rather than organic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The tidal station setting is effectively rendered with good sensory details (saltwater, wax, machinery hum), creating a strong, fitting atmosphere. The connection between the candle mold and the makeshift altar works well symbolically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of mood and uses symbolism (mold, spark, tide) effectively. However, the emotional impact feels muted due to underdeveloped characterization, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks significant resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Relies on some common tropes (unhinged professor, mysterious ritual) and slightly overwrought phrasing ("bled into night," "secrets simmered"). While the combination of elements is somewhat unusual, the execution lacks a truly distinctive voice or fresh perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story feels somewhat constrained by the assigned elements, particularly the lecture method, rather than using them seamlessly to serve a unique vision. Cohesion is present, but the narrative doesn't fully transcend its components to create a deeply resonant whole.</comment>
