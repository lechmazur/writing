<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The character's core traits (cynicism, humble arrogance) are stated rather than convincingly demonstrated through action or internal monologue; motivation is clear but lacks deep exploration within the narrative constraints.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot follows a discernible arc (setup, confrontation, climax) driven by the 'awaken' action, but the 'echo of a voice' method feels slightly underdeveloped as a trigger; coherence is maintained, though the resolution feels abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The setting (lighthouse library) and timeframe ("borrowed century") effectively create an eerie, nostalgic atmosphere that supports the character's isolation and quest; the astronomical globe is well-integrated into this environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story achieves a consistent mood and uses some effective imagery ("liquid starlight"), but the emotional impact relies more on stated feelings than deeply shown internal conflict; the ending offers thematic resonance but lacks profound impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Relies on familiar tropes (isolated mage, powerful artifact, forgotten magic) without significant subversion; language is competent but contains some generic phrasing ("crumbling tomes," "eerie shadows") and lacks a truly distinctive voice or style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story integrates the assigned elements with reasonable cohesion, particularly the setting and object, but some elements (attribute, concept) feel less integral; it functions as a competent scene but doesn't transcend its components to achieve exceptional depth or originality.</comment>
