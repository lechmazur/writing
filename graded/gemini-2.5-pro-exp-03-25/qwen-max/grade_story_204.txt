<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (overcoming prejudice) is stated but weakly connected to her actions (going to a spaceport). Her profession (cuddler) feels tacked on, only justified retroactively by the ghost's exposition rather than organically informing her perspective or actions. The internal change feels unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The plot relies heavily on coincidence (finding the specific object, the ghost appearing) and exposition dump to connect disparate elements. The arc (find object -> meet ghost -> epiphany) is present but feels rushed and contrived within the word limit, lacking logical coherence between the setup and the supernatural encounter.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport setting creates a strong initial atmosphere of decay, but its relevance to a train conductor ghost, a ticket punch, and the character's internal conflict is tenuous. The "unusually usual stillness" is intriguing but underdeveloped. Atmosphere supports the ghost scene but feels disconnected from other elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story attempts thematic depth regarding prejudice and connection ("unspoken rules"), but relies on the ghost explicitly stating the message rather than showing Amara's realization through experience or subtle interaction. The dialogue is functional but expository. The ending feels abrupt and overly neat, lacking resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>While the combination of elements is somewhat original, the execution leans on tropes (mysterious object, wise supernatural guide delivering the theme). The ghost's appearance and exposition feel formulaic. Emotional nuance is stated ("felt tears prick her eyes") rather than shown. Some descriptive language is effective, but overall lacks a distinctive voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story struggles significantly with cohesion; the assigned elements feel forced together rather than organically integrated. The spaceport, cuddler profession, and ghost conductor lack compelling narrative justification for coexisting. The brief length exacerbates the reliance on exposition and hinders deeper exploration.</comment>
