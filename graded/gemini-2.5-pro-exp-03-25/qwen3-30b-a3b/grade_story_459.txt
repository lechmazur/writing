<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation (liberation) is clear and drives the central action, but the 'elevator repair technician' role feels extraneous and disconnected from the core narrative of ghost-seeing and family history. The 'elegantly clumsy' attribute is stated but minimally demonstrated, lacking impact on her actions or revealing deeper character nuances.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a surprisingly complete arc within the word limit, moving from investigation to discovery and resolution. However, the 'staking out ghost tours' method feels tacked on and doesn't logically connect to the eventual discovery via dissecting the crown in the lab. Pacing is generally effective, but this extraneous element disrupts coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The 'sand castle preservation lab' setting offers a unique, evocative atmosphere that aligns well with themes of memory and fragility. The 'dissonance of silence' concept is explicitly linked to the atmosphere, though its execution sometimes relies more on telling than showing. The connection between the setting and the flower crown (archive discovery) is functional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (crown, sand castles as altars) and imagery to explore themes of grief, memory, and letting go, achieving some emotional resonance. The central conflict (Mira's internal struggle and the ghosts' unrest) is clear and resolved satisfyingly. However, the reliance on stating the 'dissonance' concept rather than purely evoking it slightly weakens the craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the combination of elements (ghosts, sand castles, elevator tech) is original, some phrasing feels slightly overwrought ("grains of memory," "curled like a sigh," "paradox of lightness and loss"). The 'elegantly clumsy' attribute feels like a potentially formulaic addition. The core emotional discovery avoids major clich√©s, but some descriptive language verges on generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story manages to weave most elements together into a relatively cohesive emotional narrative, particularly the connection between the ghosts, the crown, and Mira's ancestry. The core theme of letting go is well-served. However, the elevator technician role and the ghost tour method feel less integrated, suggesting the story is slightly burdened by, rather than fully elevated by, all assigned constraints.</comment>
