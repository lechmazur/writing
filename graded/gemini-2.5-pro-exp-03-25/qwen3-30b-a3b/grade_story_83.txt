<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation ("sow seeds of a better tomorrow") feels generic and grandiloquent, weakly connected to the immediate actions. The core attribute ("suspiciously trusting") is stated as backstory but minimally demonstrated or tested in the present narrative beyond a momentary waver.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, driven by the method (candle tracing) and action ("Excel"). However, the mechanism linking the candle pattern to blueprints and the verbal trigger feel somewhat convenient and lacking deeper integration or explanation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The mirror labyrinth setting is effectively evoked and integrated thematically. However, the assigned timeframe ("during leaf raking") is mentioned once as cover but feels entirely disconnected from the presented scene, creating a slight dissonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Strong use of imagery and symbolism (mirrors, candle), creating palpable atmosphere. The central conflict and theme of self-confrontation are present, but the dialogue is functional rather than sharp, and deeper emotional resonance is limited.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>While avoiding overt AI tells, the narrative relies heavily on familiar tropes (abandoned lab, mirror symbolism, mysterious double) without significant subversion. Some phrasing feels slightly ornate or formulaic ("adjusted her gloves," "dust thick with the weight"). Lacks a truly distinct voice or originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves reasonable cohesion, weaving most elements together functionally. However, some components (timeframe, motivation, attribute) feel less integral than others, suggesting the story is constrained by the elements rather than organically growing from them.</comment>
