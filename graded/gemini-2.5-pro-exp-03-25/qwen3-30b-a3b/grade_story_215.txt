<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The character's core attributes ("rattled," "inwardly social") are stated rather than effectively demonstrated through action or nuanced behaviour. His motivation is clear, but his actions feel more driven by the puzzle-plot mechanics than a deeply felt internal drive stemming from these traits. The "exorcist" label feels largely superficial.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot structure, driven by the puzzle sequence, provides clear progression within the word count. However, the cause-and-effect feels somewhat linear and reliant on convenient discoveries rather than organic unfolding. The arc is present but feels compressed, ending abruptly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The psychic research facility setting offers potential contrast, but the "amid dance lessons" timeframe feels poorly integrated and almost irrelevant, weakening the world's coherence. The "coy aggression" tone is underdeveloped, primarily confined to the director's brief appearance. Atmospheric elements like the fungi chamber are effective but isolated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear theme (science vs. supernatural synthesis) and uses symbolism (postcard, dance). However, the execution relies more on stating themes ("Science and wonder are not enemies") than demonstrating them subtly. The conflict is present but resolved via a simple console activation and a concluding standoff, lacking deeper resonance. Showing vs. telling is inconsistent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The narrative employs several familiar tropes (mysterious object, hidden passage, secret experiments, cryptic message) without significant subversion. The puzzle progression feels somewhat generic. While functional, the prose lacks a distinctive voice or truly fresh imagery, occasionally using slightly clich√©d phrases ("shadows that danced like ghosts").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The story struggles to make the assigned elements feel entirely organic; particularly "dance lessons" and "inwardly social" feel tacked on rather than intrinsic. While cohesive on a surface level, the narrative feels somewhat constrained by the need to incorporate these disparate parts, hindering deeper exploration or originality.</comment>
