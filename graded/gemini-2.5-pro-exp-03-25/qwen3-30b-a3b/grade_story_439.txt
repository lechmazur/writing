<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Functional arc, but relies on convenient mystical elements (comet, mirror) and rushes the core transformation, weakening its impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Competent integration of elements but the result feels constructed and conceptually driven, missing the spark of originality and depth for premier publication.</comment>
