<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character traits like "no-nonsense" are asserted rather than demonstrated, and the key attribute "steadily free" feels tacked onto the ending rather than earned or explored. Motivation is clear but lacks nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc driven by the assigned action/method, but the resolution feels passive and lacks complexity or surprise. Coherence is maintained, but the structure is somewhat predictable within the constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The atmosphere is effectively established using standard genre elements, but the unique "dollhouse" aspect of the setting feels underdeveloped and superficial, serving more as backdrop than integral component.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Relies heavily on the central heartbeat/rhythm metaphor, risking repetitiveness. While symbolism and theme are present, the emotional impact is muted, and the ending feels somewhat foregone rather than deeply resonant or thought-provoking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story uses several familiar phrases and atmospheric tropes without significant subversion. While the core combination has potential, the execution lacks a distinctive voice or truly fresh perspective, feeling competent but somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story successfully incorporates the assigned elements, but they feel somewhat imposed, resulting in a narrative that reads more like a skillful execution of constraints than an organically conceived piece. Cohesion feels manufactured.</comment>
