<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The 'amiable' trait feels superficial and underdeveloped; the scholar's motivation is stated but his transformation feels abrupt rather than a natural progression stemming from deep-seated character traits or internal conflict. His voice lacks distinction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc (encounter, shift, acceptance) and uses the 'vibrate' action repeatedly, but the central transformation feels rushed within the word count. The 'waiting room' flashback integration is weak and disrupts coherence slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric creation through effective sensory details relevant to the lighthouse setting. The setting strongly enhances the mood and core concept. However, the 'waiting room' timeframe element feels poorly integrated and jarring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (crossword, lighthouse, shadows) and strong atmospheric writing. However, the narrative leans towards telling the emotional shift and resolution ('the scholar understood') rather than showing it, and the ending feels somewhat convenient and abrupt. Style occasionally borders on overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Relies heavily on the 'haunted place + investigator' trope without significant subversion. The language, while atmospheric, sometimes uses predictable 'literary' phrasing ("sterile logic," "forgotten lullabies"). The scholar's rapid acceptance lacks deep psychological nuance, feeling more thematically driven than authentic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story attempts cohesion, successfully integrating most elements like the setting, object, and concept. However, the character arc feels constrained, and certain elements (timeframe, attribute) feel forced rather than organic, hindering overall seamlessness and depth.</comment>
