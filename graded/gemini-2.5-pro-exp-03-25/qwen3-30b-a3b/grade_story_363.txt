<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The 'grieving miner' aspect is established, but the 'passionately indifferent' attribute feels more like a stated label than a deeply demonstrated trait; the indifference overshadows any clear sense of passion *in* that indifference, making motivation feel slightly inconsistent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc, but the assigned method ('via after-images...') feels tacked on rather than driving the narrative; the connection between nightmares and coaxing truth from memories/the bell isn't strongly executed within the plot's progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The setting and initial timeframe create mood, but the assigned 'poignant levity' tone is almost entirely absent; the atmosphere is overwhelmingly somber and melancholic, lacking the required element of levity, which is a significant mismatch.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (the bell) and evocative imagery creates subtext about loss and progress; however, the emotional impact is somewhat muted by the slightly detached narrative voice and the underdeveloped 'passionately indifferent' angle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While avoiding overt AI tells, some phrasing leans towards slightly generic literary flourish ("weight of unspoken truths," "bones of the city") and the core concept, while handled with atmosphere, doesn't feel strikingly original. The 'passionately indifferent' character trait feels somewhat formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story integrates most elements reasonably well, particularly the bell and the miner's grief, but struggles significantly with incorporating the assigned tone ('poignant levity') and fully realizing the 'passionately indifferent' attribute, making the overall cohesion feel slightly strained.</comment>
