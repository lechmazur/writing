<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character remains an archetype ("exiled prince") lacking unique voice or depth; motivation ("cure for loneliness") is clear but simplistic and resolved too neatly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a predictable quest structure, feeling rushed within the word count; the "unseen forces" concept is superficially integrated and lacks meaningful impact on events.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere ("aged wood," "eerie") relies on generic descriptors; the assigned "familiar unknown" tone is stated but not effectively evoked through sensory detail or mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The story relies heavily on telling the theme ("The cure... lay not in the herb...") rather than showing it through nuanced action or subtext; lacks memorable imagery or profound emotional impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Narrative feels highly formulaic, employing common tropes (magical cure, journey of self-discovery) without originality; lacks a distinctive style or authentic emotional depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>While elements are technically included, the story feels constructed around them rather than organically arising from them, resulting in a lack of depth and artistic cohesion.</comment>
