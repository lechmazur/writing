<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The character concept (exorcist with stage fright) is intriguing but underdeveloped. The stage fright is stated rather than convincingly shown, and its resolution feels abrupt and unearned, lacking psychological depth. Motivation is clear but generic; her actions (toy assembly) feel disconnected from her core role and fear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The plot attempts an arc (fear to resolve) but feels rushed and relies on weak catalysts (toy assembly, key sound) for internal change. The core action "submerge" is used metaphorically, but its connection to the literal setting and the preceding events is tenuous. Coherence suffers due to the disjointed elements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The "orbital debris" setting is evocative but largely wasted; it serves as mere backdrop with no meaningful integration into the plot, character's internal state, or the theme of inherited lies. The atmosphere feels generic sci-fi rather than specifically tailored to the emotional core. The toy assembly feels incongruous within this setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story attempts symbolism (flowers, toys, key) but often explains the metaphors directly ("became metaphors for"), weakening their impact. The central conflict is present but resolved too easily. While aiming for depth, the execution lacks subtlety and relies heavily on telling rather than showing, diminishing emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The combination of elements feels forced, leading to narrative inconsistencies (toy assembly in orbital debris?). The language occasionally dips into clich√© ("ashes of 'never'," "ghosts of her family's past") and overly earnest pronouncements ("sculptor of possibility"). The emotional arc follows a predictable template without sufficient nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The story struggles significantly with cohesion; the assigned elements feel more like a checklist than organically integrated components. The orbital debris setting and toy assembly, in particular, seem arbitrary and detract from the potentially interesting core conflict. The brevity highlights the lack of depth rather than feeling like a deliberate stylistic choice.</comment>
