<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The character’s motivation is cliché and his central epiphany is sudden and explicitly stated, rather than earned through nuanced development.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent but overly simplistic and predictable; the resolution from rebellion to acceptance is rushed and feels unearned within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A significant strength; the setting is highly atmospheric and rich with specific, evocative sensory details that effectively support the story's themes of decay and memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The craft is fatally undermined by a heavy-handed "telling" approach, explicitly explaining its own symbolism ("mirrored his own entrapment"), which strips the narrative of subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The narrative feels formulaic, relying on a predictable combination of common tropes (the wise ghost, the symbolic object) and stated emotions without offering a unique voice or perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The story feels mechanically constructed to accommodate its assigned elements, resulting in a logical but artificial narrative that lacks the organic depth required for high-level publication.</comment>
