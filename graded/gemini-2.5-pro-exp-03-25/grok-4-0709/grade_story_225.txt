<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The character's motivation is functional but lacks depth; the transition from "dangerous" rogue to peacemaker is abrupt, and the love for an enemy glimpsed through a periscope is a thin, familiar trope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot structure is commendably tight and complete for the word count, but its coherence relies on significant exposition dumps ("telling") rather than seamlessly integrated world-building ("showing").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story's greatest strength. The world and atmosphere are exceptionally well-realized, using dense, evocative sensory details to create a tangible and compelling steampunk environment that perfectly serves the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The literary craft is ambitious and the thematic layering is evident, but the prose frequently borders on overwrought. The repetition of the "unjustly fair" motif feels heavy-handed, sacrificing subtlety for effect.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the core concept is original, the execution feels formulaic. The prose has an overwrought, "literary" affectation, and the insistent repetition of assigned keywords feels mechanical, as if adhering to a checklist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The piece shows immense skill in cohesively weaving disparate elements into a functional narrative. However, it reads more like a masterclass in fulfilling a prompt than a story born of organic impulse, with the authorial effort remaining too visible.</comment>
