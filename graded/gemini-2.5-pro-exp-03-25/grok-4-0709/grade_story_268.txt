<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The character arc is functional but lacks nuance; the climactic emotional cost is explicitly stated rather than shown, weakening its impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The plot's coherence is critically undermined by the central method—a magical mirror—which is illogical and requires an unearned suspension of disbelief.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Despite a unique combination of elements, the execution relies on familiar tropes (tragic vigilante, magical object) and a predictable emotional beat, feeling formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The narrative feels reverse-engineered to fit a checklist of disparate elements, resulting in a contrived plot that lacks organic cohesion.</comment>
