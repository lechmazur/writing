<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias's character arc is functional but rushed; his "radio host ego" is asserted rather than demonstrated before its convenient, unearned resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The plot is overstuffed with concepts, forcing a summary-like pace and relying on a tonally dissonant, illogical contrivance (the cooking class) for a key event.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The world-building is a superficial collection of high-concept terms ("nebula broth," "void carrots") rather than an immersive, cohesive atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The story fatally undermines its own craft by explicitly stating its themes and explaining its metaphors, a cardinal sin of "telling" that removes all subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a predictable, almost algorithmic template—problem, overtly explained metaphor, solution—which feels inauthentic and lacks human nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story is clearly constructed to accommodate its assigned elements rather than having them serve an organic narrative, feeling more like a mechanical exercise than art.</comment>
