<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The character is a functional vehicle for the plot's high concepts but lacks a distinct voice or internal depth, feeling more like an archetype ("skewed visionary") than a developed person.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a full but rushed arc; its coherence hinges on asserted connections (pottery mirroring sketches, herbs causing anomalies) that feel logically thin and convenient rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story's primary strength lies in its world-building, effectively establishing a dense, evocative atmosphere that blends the futuristic setting with a melancholic tone of vanishing traditions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The prose is excessively ornate and self-conscious, sacrificing narrative clarity and emotional impact for florid descriptions that consistently tell the reader about themes and miracles instead of showing them.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice feels artificial; the prose is laden with repetitive, self-consciously "literary" phrases ("silent revolution," "mundane miracles," "skewed visionary") that suggest a formulaic construction rather than a unique authorial style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>While all assigned elements are present, they dominate the narrative to such an extent that the story feels like a mechanical exercise in fulfilling a prompt rather than an organic piece of fiction.</comment>
