<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character serves as an effective vessel for the theme, but his internal state is rendered in abstract terms ("past betrayals") rather than specific, grounding details, leaving him more symbolic than psychologically deep.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot forms a tight, coherent allegorical arc. However, its logic is entirely metaphorical, which makes the resolution feel thematically inevitable rather than narratively surprising.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The "infernal kitchen" setting is a significant strengthâ€”a highly original, atmospheric, and thematically resonant concept that elevates the entire narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The craft is ambitious and the use of symbolism is potent, but the prose is so consistently elevated and dense that it risks feeling overwrought, prioritizing stylistic weight over narrative clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>While the concept is original, the prose falls into a repetitive stylistic pattern of "abstract noun + evocative verb phrase," which, though lyrical, can feel like a high-level formula rather than a unique authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story demonstrates an impressive and cohesive synthesis of disparate elements into a powerful fable. Its primary achievement is leaving the reader with a resonant, bittersweet theme, though its stylistic density is a barrier.</comment>
