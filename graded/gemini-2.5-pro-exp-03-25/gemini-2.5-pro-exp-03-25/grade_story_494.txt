<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The character's internal conflict (arrogance vs. doubt) is established, but the transition feels somewhat abrupt, relying more on stated description ("doubtfully confident," "something hollow") than purely organic revelation. The motivation shift ("deliver a spark") emerges suddenly, lacking sufficient grounding in the preceding characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The plot structure is clear (arrival, request, decision, departure), but the central turning point relies heavily on a sudden, convenient memory (the song), weakening the sense of earned character change. The pacing around the decision feels compressed, making the resolution slightly abrupt for literary fiction standards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The atmosphere of decay in the courtyard is effectively rendered with sensory details (ink, moss, dim light), contrasting well with Kaelen's usual world. However, some descriptions verge on clich√© ("ancient as the gnarled plum tree"), preventing it from reaching exceptional levels.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story utilizes clear symbolism (tapestry, seal) and achieves a degree of emotional resonance, but the subtext feels somewhat surface-level. The final image of the ink bloom is striking but borders on overly dramatic. Dialogue is functional rather than memorable. The central conflict is present but resolved somewhat predictably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While avoiding overt AI tells, the story employs familiar tropes (gruff warrior with hidden depths) without significant subversion. Phrasing like "doubtfully confident" feels slightly awkward. Emotional states are sometimes stated directly rather than purely shown through nuanced action or internal thought. Lacks a truly distinctive authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story integrates the required elements competently, but the construction feels apparent, particularly the mechanism triggering the character's decision. It functions as a complete scene but doesn't quite achieve the seamlessness or profound resonance expected at the highest tier. The brief length feels appropriate for the scope.</comment>
