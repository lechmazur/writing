<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and drives the plot, but the character feels more like an archetype fulfilling a function than a deeply nuanced individual; lacks a truly distinct voice or profound internal complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a coherent arc from problem to resolution within the word count, but the discovery of the method (reading notations on the booth) feels overly convenient and slightly undermines the preceding struggle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The floating library setting and its atmosphere are effectively evoked and support the theme, but the initial world of "consistent miracles" feels somewhat underdeveloped and abstract by comparison.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully explores its theme of seeking authenticity beyond superficiality and uses symbolism effectively (shell vs. miracles), but the prose, while competent, lacks truly exceptional, memorable phrasing or profound subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While avoiding obvious AI pitfalls and clich√©s, the narrative doesn't fully escape a sense of literary familiarity; the combination of elements is creative, but the execution lacks a truly unique authorial stamp or surprising insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion, integrating the required elements reasonably well into a focused narrative, but it doesn't quite transcend the feeling of being a well-executed response to constraints into a work of undeniable power or originality.</comment>
