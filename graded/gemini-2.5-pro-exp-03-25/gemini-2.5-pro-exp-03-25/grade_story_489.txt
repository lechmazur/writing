<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, but the character feels somewhat archetypal, serving the theme more than possessing deep individuality. The 'aggressively kind' attribute is asserted but lacks nuanced exploration. Voice is distinct but uniformly lofty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent with a clear arc (setup, trigger, action, anticipation). The action drives the climax, and the method fits the supernatural context. However, the causal links (lighthouse-dancer-whale) rely heavily on mystical assertion rather than narrative development within the tight space.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Excellent atmospheric creation through strong sensory details ('salt-laced stone', 'dust motes', 'whale moan'). The haunted lighthouse setting strongly supports the character's purpose and the story's mystical tone. The modern whistle provides an intentional, if slightly jarring, contrast.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (whistle as signal, dance as ember) and evocative imagery. The perspective is unique, and subtext regarding cultural memory is evident. However, the prose occasionally borders on overwrought ('spectral being', 'oceanic power'), slightly diminishing the impact through excessive loftiness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While the combination of elements is original, the elevated, consistently formal tone and certain poetic phrases ('shadowed apex', 'void of apathy') can feel slightly generic or overly stylized, lacking grounding human nuance. Emotion is more declared than subtly shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive whole, serving a clear theme. The brevity feels purposeful. The creative combination is notable, leaving a lingering sense of mystical urgency, though stylistic choices sometimes slightly hinder absolute clarity or impact.</comment>
