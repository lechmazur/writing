<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear, but the "blameless smuggler" aspect is asserted rather than shown, and "logically emotional" feels underdeveloped and superficially portrayed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Functional plot structure with clear stakes (countdown), but the resolution via the key feels convenient ("long shot" pays off) rather than earned tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is effectively established using the whispering gallery setting and unique scent-based navigation; sensory details are present but could be sharper.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Competent craft with some effective imagery (blooms), but relies on telling ("grandiose modesty") and the ending feels slightly anticlimactic after the build-up.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The scent-mapping offers originality, but some phrasing borders on genre clich√©, and the handling of the "logically emotional" trait lacks convincing nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements are incorporated, but integration feels slightly forced in places (smuggler, emotional state); reads like a competent execution of constraints, not transcendent fiction.</comment>
