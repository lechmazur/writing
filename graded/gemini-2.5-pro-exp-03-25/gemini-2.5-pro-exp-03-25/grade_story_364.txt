<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and drives actions, but the character feels somewhat archetypal ("skewed visionary") rather than deeply nuanced; his voice is indistinct due to third-person narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, but the core mechanism (metaphorical application of pottery hieroglyphs to temporal mechanics) stretches credulity, slightly weakening coherence under rigorous scrutiny.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Excellent integration of setting (temporal anomaly study) and object (sketches); the atmosphere effectively juxtaposes ancient crafts with sterile science, strongly supporting the theme and character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance (value of the past, unconventional knowledge) and effective use of imagery/metaphor; the ending provides satisfying closure and subtext, demonstrating solid craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The core concept and combination of elements feel highly original, avoiding common tropes and obvious AI patterns; language is controlled and purposeful, contributing to a distinct narrative feel.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements are woven together creatively, serving the story's unique premise; despite the slight strain in the central metaphor's logic, the piece feels cohesive and leaves a memorable impression.</comment>
