<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear but the 'tailor' background feels underdeveloped and weakly connected to actions; the final metaphor feels tacked on rather than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Presents a coherent scene and establishes the premise effectively, but lacks a full narrative arc or resolution within the word count; the core action (confession for reassurance) feels somewhat static.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Effectively establishes mood using the steampunk setting and storm, integrating them well, though some atmospheric descriptions lean on familiar genre tropes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Evokes mood and presents a clear theme of escaping loss, but relies heavily on stated emotion ("hopeful desperation," "stark terror") and somewhat obvious symbolism (mirror, storm) rather than deep subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Avoids major AI tells but lacks a distinctive authorial voice; the combination of elements is interesting, but the execution doesn't feel exceptionally fresh, using some predictable phrasing ("fabric of infinity").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Integrates most assigned elements adequately into a cohesive scene, but the story doesn't transcend the sum of its parts due to underdeveloped character aspects and a lack of truly original execution.</comment>
