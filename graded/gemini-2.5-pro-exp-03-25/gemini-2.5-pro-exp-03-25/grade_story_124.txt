<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character trait "skittish" feels asserted rather than demonstrated through action; focus is more on concept than deep characterization within the limited space.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Clear internal arc achieved, but lacks significant tension or external stakes, feeling more like a mood piece than a fully developed plot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric contrast between setting and theme, but weak integration of the timeframe element (simile only) and slightly convenient sensory detail (scent).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Original combination of concepts, but execution includes some near-clich√© phrasing ("fabric of awareness," "territory of the mind") and lacks truly distinctive stylistic flair.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements are mostly well-integrated into a cohesive vignette, though some feel less essential or elegantly incorporated than others (notably the timeframe).</comment>
