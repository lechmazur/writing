<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, but the 'spiritually secular' attribute feels awkwardly phrased and underdeveloped. Character voice is indistinct internal monologue; the reaction to the button serves the plot but doesn't reveal deep nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot structure (choice-divination-decision) is coherent and complete within the word limit, but relies heavily on the somewhat contrived coffee stain method. The 'obliterate' consequence feels slightly forced to raise stakes rather than organically arising. Pacing is adequate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport setting is effectively rendered and strongly supports the themes of decay and fading traditions. Atmosphere is consistent, and the object fits well. Sensory details are present, though not exceptionally striking.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Uses clear symbolism (button, stains) and establishes conflict. However, phrases like "fractal sorrow" feel overly explained and detract from emotional impact ('telling' not 'showing'). The ending is purposeful but predictable given the character's established motivation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Relies on the familiar trope of tangible vs. digital knowledge. The coffee stain divination feels like a quirky but ultimately standard plot device. "Fractal sorrow" is an example of slightly ornate, less authentic phrasing. Lacks a truly unique authorial voice or surprising turn.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements are integrated serviceably, but don't always combine to create something greater than their parts. The story feels competent but constrained by the elements rather than liberated by them; lacks the spark of exceptional originality or depth required for top-tier publication.</comment>
