<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation (legacy, mapping) is clear and drives action, but Maya's individual depth beyond her inherited role feels underdeveloped within this brief piece. The 'selfless musician' attribute is demonstrated through dedication but lacks nuanced exploration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot follows a coherent arc (setup, interaction, reflection) within the word limit. The action ('lunge') serves as a minor climax, and the core concept ('mark of trust') underpins the interaction. Pacing is adequate, though the transition to playing the cello feels slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The world-building is exceptionally strong and atmospheric, effectively using sensory details (soundscape, vibrations). The recycled spaceship setting and the integration of sound elements (record, chimes, whalesong) create a unique and immersive mood that strongly supports the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional resonance and impact through evocative imagery and symbolism (warped record, generational music). The central theme of legacy and connection is clear. Craft is strong, particularly in merging sound and space opera elements.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The core concept is original and avoids common sci-fi tropes. While the language is largely effective, phrases like "savage grace" feel slightly affected. The generational legacy trope is present but handled with sufficient uniqueness through the musical context. Emotion is conveyed more through description than deep internal reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its disparate elements into a cohesive and evocative snapshot. The brevity works, focusing the narrative effectively. The combination of musical heritage, spacefaring, and whale conservation feels creative and leaves a lasting impression.</comment>
