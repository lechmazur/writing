<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear, but the 'angrily peaceful' attribute is asserted rather than convincingly demonstrated through action or internal monologue; the 'prodigy' backstory feels slightly retrofitted to justify the unique method.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot hinges on a highly convenient and somewhat implausible hacking method; the arrival and acceptance of the healers feels abrupt, resolving the character's isolation too neatly within the compressed timeframe.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The ghost train setting is evocative and well-utilized for atmosphere, but the specified 'aloof passion' tone is inconsistently realized, often lapsing into straightforward narrative description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>While the core concept is unique, the execution lacks sufficient depth and relies too much on stating emotions ('burning anger', 'unusual peace') rather than showing them; the ending feels somewhat predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The central conceit (hacking playlists for herb formulas) is original but strains credulity significantly, bordering on techno-fantasy without adequate grounding, diminishing overall authenticity despite avoiding common clich√©s.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Cohesion is hampered by the fantastical central mechanism; while elements are present, they feel somewhat assembled rather than organically interwoven, and the writing lacks a truly distinctive voice.</comment>
