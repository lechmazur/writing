<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mai's motivation is clear and consistent with the 'solemn orchardist' role, but Lily remains somewhat functional, defined more by the 'overlooked child' concept than deep characterisation; the 'endearingly irritating' trait is stated but not effectively shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story achieves a clear arc within the word limit, but the plot resolution, particularly the rapid city-wide spread of the program, feels overly convenient and slightly undermines the preceding emotional build-up. Pacing is slightly rushed at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Excellent integration of the cyberpunk rooftop garden setting, contrasting technology and nature to effectively enhance the core themes and atmosphere. Sensory details are evocative and establish a strong sense of place.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully evokes emotion and employs symbolism (key, trees), but relies too heavily on telling the reader Mai's realisations ("Mai understood," "Mai finally saw") rather than purely showing them through action or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the blend of cyberpunk and pastoral themes offers some originality, the narrative follows a somewhat predictable reconciliation arc, and some phrasing ("symphony of pixels and petals") borders on clich√©. Lacks truly fresh insight or subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates competence in weaving assigned elements into a cohesive whole, but it lacks the exceptional depth, narrative sharpness, or profound resonance required for top-tier publication. It feels complete but not particularly memorable or challenging.</comment>
