<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The character's hesitation and awkwardness are clearly established and consistent, but the 'swordsman' aspect feels tacked on and irrelevant to the plot's resolution, which relies on observation. His motivation (preserving old ways) is stated but lacks conviction, fitting his hesitancy but weakening his narrative drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot structure is reasonably coherent within the word limit, moving from observation to understanding to action (filing the postcard). The method (crab patterns) drives the resolution logically. However, the transition from 'guardian with sword' to 'documentarian' feels slightly abrupt rather than smoothly developed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details (steam, frost, bitter wind) creating a distinct atmosphere that effectively supports the 'boundary between worlds' concept. The geothermal vents are integral to the plot mechanism (crab emergence). The atmosphere enhances Marcus's isolation and the strangeness of the events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong use of imagery (crabs, shells, steam, frost) and symbolism (shells as discarded attempts, patterns on sword/crab formations). The ending provides thematic closure, shifting the focus from combat to understanding. The central conflict is more internal (duty vs. doubt) than external, resolved quietly. Shows emotion effectively through action/description rather than just telling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The core concept (scroll-bearing hermit crabs from geothermal vents at a world boundary) is highly original and avoids common fantasy tropes. The prose is generally well-crafted, avoiding egregious AI-like repetition or generic phrasing. The blend of mundane (postcard) and fantastical (vents, crabs, scrolls) feels fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story achieves a strong sense of cohesion despite integrating disparate elements. The elements generally serve the narrative, although the swordsman aspect feels less crucial than others. The brevity feels appropriate for the focused scene. The narrative leaves a lingering feeling of quiet transition and the weight of subtle choices.</comment>
