<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character's core motivation (wife's ghost, gathering souls) is established, but the assigned attribute "indefinitely absolute" feels asserted rather than demonstrated, weakening the portrayal. His actions align, but the obsession lacks nuanced depth beyond the initial premise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc, but the connection between the method (rewriting diaries) and the outcome (reconciling unrelated spirits like the father/daughter) feels tenuous and underdeveloped within the word count. The "proliferate" action is mentioned but not fully explored, limiting its impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere (starless night, library, whispers) is effectively evoked and supports the concept. However, the specific setting term "whisper collection point" feels slightly tacked on rather than organically integrated with the established library setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story uses its central metaphor (crosswords as bridges) effectively and has a unique premise. However, the emotional impact relies heavily on the concept rather than deep character engagement. The theme of reconciliation is clear, but the craft sometimes leans towards telling ("noble chaos") over showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The core concept is original, avoiding simple ghost story tropes. However, some phrasing ("byzantine grid," "sacred geometry," "noble chaos") borders on overly ornate or slightly clich√©d within this specific subgenre. The diary-rewriting mechanism lacks specific detail, feeling somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story attempts cohesion, but some elements (diary rewriting logic, "whisper collection point," "indefinitely absolute") feel less integrated than others, suggesting the story is slightly constrained *by* the elements rather than seamlessly using them. The core idea is strong, but execution needs refinement for top-tier publication.</comment>
