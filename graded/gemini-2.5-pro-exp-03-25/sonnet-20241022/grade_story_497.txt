<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character attributes like 'daydreaming' and 'seldom regular' are asserted rather than convincingly demonstrated through action or internal thought; motivation is present but standard for the genre.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The plot arc exists but hinges significantly on the convenient discovery of the satellite fragment; the core action 'promote' fits the character's ultimate intention but not the primary activity (deciphering) shown in the story.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The submerged setting and timeframe are effectively integrated and atmospheric, but potentially rich details like 'cursed waters' remain superficial flavour text.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core idea holds promise, but impact is diminished by stating the theme ('mathematical expression of empathy') directly rather than allowing it to emerge through subtext; lacks genuine emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Relies on familiar tropes (misunderstood genius, ancient advanced message) without significant subversion; some language feels generic ("otherworldly sheen," "extraordinary") and the satellite's amplifying effect is an unoriginal narrative shortcut.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the elements are included, their integration feels somewhat mechanical, lacking the seamlessness and organic feel required for top-tier literary fiction; the story doesn't quite transcend its constituent parts.</comment>
