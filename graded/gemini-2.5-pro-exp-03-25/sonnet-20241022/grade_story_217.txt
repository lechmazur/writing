<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (preserving mother's legacy), but the 'underestimated rebel' trait feels asserted rather than demonstrated. The transition from isolated grief to decisive action is abrupt, lacking sufficient internal development within the word count.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot structure (call -> action -> confrontation -> resolution) is coherent and complete within the word limit. However, the resolution relies on a convenient and overly optimistic change of heart in the developer, weakening its credibility for a top-tier literary context.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The restaurant setting is evoked well through sensory details (smell), but the initial haunted house setting feels functionally disconnected and underutilized, serving primarily as a framing device rather than being deeply integrated atmospherically or thematically with the core narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism (knife, pho) effectively and establishes a clear theme of memory and adaptation. However, thematic statements are often too explicit ("adapting wasn't about surviving..."), diminishing subtext and relying more on telling than showing deeper meanings.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>While avoiding overt AI markers, the narrative leans on familiar tropes (saving the family place with food) and a somewhat formulaic, sentimental resolution. Some emotional beats and phrasing feel generic rather than uniquely nuanced or stylistically distinct.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story attempts to weave elements together, but the integration feels forced, particularly the haunted house setting and the 'rebel' character aspect. These elements seem more like constraints fulfilled than organic parts of a cohesive whole, slightly undermining the story's overall impact.</comment>
