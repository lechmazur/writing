<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The 'stage fright' attribute feels tacked on and underdeveloped; it's mentioned initially but doesn't meaningfully impact Elena's actions or create significant internal conflict during the core ritual. Her motivation is clear but delivered somewhat expositionally through the grandmother's confession rather than shown through subtler character interaction or internal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, but the resolution hinges entirely on the revealed 'true method' (quantum flowers/music), feeling more like an info-dump than an earned climax. The connection between assembling a toy rocket and manipulating quantum fields via flowers/music feels conceptually strained and lacks convincing internal logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of domestic elements (pressed flowers, toy rocket, lullaby) against the high-tech, desolate setting (orbital debris, abandoned satellite) creates a strong, unique atmosphere. The setting effectively enhances the mood of isolation and hidden, unconventional power. This is perhaps the story's strongest aspect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story introduces intriguing concepts (quantum exorcism, inherited secrets), but relies too heavily on explicitly stating themes and explanations ("true exorcism was always about...") rather than demonstrating them through action and subtext. The ending feels somewhat abrupt, lacking deeper resonance despite the attempt at profundity ("guardian of the threshold").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>While the *combination* of sci-fi and exorcism with quantum mechanics is somewhat original, the execution feels formulaic in its reliance on the 'hidden family secret' trope. The 'quantum entanglement of memories' concept comes across as convenient jargon rather than a genuinely fresh or well-integrated scientific/magical system. Some phrasing feels slightly generic ("glow with an inner light").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story manages to incorporate the assigned elements, but they don't always feel organically woven together; the toy rocket assembly, in particular, feels slightly disconnected from the core flower/music box mechanism. It reads more like a competent execution of incorporating prompts than a story flowing from a singular, powerful vision.</comment>
