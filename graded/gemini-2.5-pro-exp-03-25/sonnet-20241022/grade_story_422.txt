<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The selective mutism/ventriloquism is central and functional, but the character's inner world beyond this mechanism feels underdeveloped. The 'hopelessly optimistic' attribute is stated ("irrepressible hope") more than consistently shown through nuanced behaviour, and Sebastian occasionally veers into being an exposition device rather than a fully integrated aspect of Maya's psyche.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, driven effectively by the overheard call. However, it leans heavily on the initial coincidence (specific mother, specific topic, interdimensional glitch). The resolution via weather patterns feels conceptually neat but lacks a sense of earned struggle or unexpected complexity; the final crossing is somewhat abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The core concept (three moons, parallel beach) is intriguing but utilised primarily for plot mechanics (tides, crossing). The atmosphere of the diner setting feels generic, lacking specific sensory details that would make this 'version' of Venice Beach distinct and immersive beyond the celestial bodies. More unique atmospheric detail was needed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story successfully evokes pathos around isolation and reunion, and the central symbolism (weather, puppet) is clear. However, thematic statements ("nature's way of knitting fractured families") are too explicit, lacking subtlety. The final line of dialogue feels convenient rather than deeply resonant. It shows promise but needs refinement to achieve true literary impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The core conceit is original, blending sci-fi with intimate character drama, and avoids obvious clich√©s or AI tells. However, the narrative structure feels somewhat predictable once the premise is established. The emotional arc is handled competently but lacks the deep nuance or stylistic idiosyncrasy expected at the highest level; language is clean but rarely surprising.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story integrates its required elements cohesively, forming a complete narrative miniature. Yet, it occasionally feels constrained by these elements, resulting in moments of overt exposition or convenient plot turns. It reads like a highly competent response to a specific set of constraints, rather than a work burning with singular vision or profound depth.</comment>
