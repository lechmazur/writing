<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The character arc from "aloof orphan" to emotional acceptance feels somewhat prescribed and overly swift, triggered conveniently by the discovered note rather than emerging with deep psychological complexity. The detachment is stated more than viscerally shown initially.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The plot hinges heavily on the discovery of the message, feeling slightly contrived. While possessing an arc, the integration of the gravitational anomaly feels more symbolic than structurally essential, weakening overall coherence and feeling underdeveloped within the tight constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of the mundane garage and the anomaly creates some atmosphere, but the anomaly itself isn't explored deeply, serving primarily as a metaphor. Sensory details are present (humming, floating) but lack the exceptional vividness and specificity expected at the highest level.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The central symbolism (stones, floating) is potent but risks becoming heavy-handed. The theme is clear but handled without significant subtext or nuance; the final realization about courage feels somewhat didactic. Relies too much on stating emotional shifts ("finally allowing herself to feel").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the *combination* of elements offers originality, the execution leans on familiar tropes of grief processing and symbolic objects. Phrasing like "smooth the roughest edges" feels worn. The emotional resolution, while present, lacks the subtlety and nuanced evocation of genuine human complexity, feeling somewhat formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story achieves basic cohesion, but the elements feel somewhat obviously deployed in service of the theme rather than integrating seamlessly. The brevity accentuates the slightly rushed emotional transformation, lacking the lingering resonance and depth required for top-tier fiction.</comment>
