<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation (finding partner/answers) is clear and drives actions (running, tea reading). However, the 'irate' aspect feels underdeveloped; she reads more as determined and betrayed than actively furious throughout. The 'abstractly physical' state justification is stated rather than fully embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The action (running/memorializing) provides a strong framing device, linking past betrayal to future confrontation. The plot achieves a sense of arc within the limit, ending on potent ambiguity. Pacing is effective, building intensity with the laps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport setting is highly effective, creating a palpable atmosphere of desolation, decay, and liminality that mirrors the character's internal state and enhances the theme of lingering connection/betrayal. Sensory details are strong ("cracked tarmac," "stellar dust," "skeletal towers").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (chopstick, tea leaves, running laps, shadows). Evokes emotion effectively, particularly longing and vengeful determination. The central conflict is clear, and the ending's ambiguity is purposeful, creating subtext about love/hate/betrayal. Shows more than tells.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While blending sci-fi and tasseography is somewhat novel, the betrayed-partner-chasing-the-score trope is familiar. Some phrasing ("striking a furious rhythm," "certainty that burned hotter") borders on clich√©. The emotional ambiguity (kill/kiss) is also a common trope endpoint.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves strong cohesion, weaving the disparate elements together serviceably. The running ritual as a method for processing grief and decoding clues is compelling. The brevity feels deliberate, capturing a moment of intense focus and unresolved tension. It largely transcends feeling like a checklist of elements.</comment>
