<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Martha's motivation to mend the community is clear and linked effectively to the rabbit ear, but the 'dutifully defiant' attribute feels underdeveloped; the transition from duty to defiance lacks nuanced portrayal. Her voice is indistinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, driven by the crystal's deterioration. However, the coherence relies heavily on unexplained magical mechanics (crystal, future news) whose internal logic remains opaque, weakening the cause-effect chain beyond pure symbolism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The amber prison provides a unique setting and atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the broader small-town world feels generic. The atmosphere supports the concept but lacks deep immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism (amber, ear) effectively and presents a clear theme. However, the emotional impact feels somewhat muted, and the ending, while purposeful, borders on overly neat. Subtext is present but not deeply explored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The core concept (amber prison, future-news gossip) offers originality. However, the execution leans towards familiar 'healing the community' tropes, and the prose, while clean, lacks a distinctive style or fresh metaphors. Emotional nuance is limited.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story integrates most elements cohesively, serving the central narrative. However, the reliance on unexplained phenomena and a somewhat predictable emotional arc prevents it from achieving exceptional depth or leaving a truly lingering impact. Competent, but not groundbreaking.</comment>
