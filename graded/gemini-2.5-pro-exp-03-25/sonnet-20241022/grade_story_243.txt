<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The 'necromancer' aspect is well-integrated and drives her abilities, but the 'jumpy' trait feels superficial, described rather than deeply influencing critical actions or decisions beyond initial nervousness. Her motivation is clear but lacks compelling depth beyond the assigned goal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot follows a standard investigation-discovery-confrontation arc, functional within the word limit. The 'analyzing paint drips' method is central, and the 'falter' action marks the turning point effectively. However, the transition to confrontation feels abrupt, and the resolution (quarantine) is somewhat convenient rather than hard-won.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The 'retro video game world' setting is vividly established with specific genre details. The atmosphere supports the mystery/tech-fantasy feel. However, the 'typically bizarre' attribute is generic, and the 'old gods slumber' timeframe remains underdeveloped background flavour rather than influencing the present action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story blends necromancy and coding uniquely, creating some interesting metaphors (firewall of retro justice). The central conflict and theme (hidden corruption) are clear. However, the theme is stated quite directly, and the emotional impact remains somewhat surface-level. Craft is competent but lacks profound resonance or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the core concept offers originality by merging genres, the execution leans on familiar tropes (evil ruler, hidden message). Some descriptive language ("towering amalgamation," "cascading streams") borders on generic tech/fantasy phrasing. It avoids overt AI tells but lacks a truly distinctive, individual authorial voice or surprising narrative turns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story manages to weave the assigned elements into a coherent, if somewhat predictable, narrative. The combination of necromancy and retro gaming is the main strength. However, it feels slightly constrained by the elements, lacking the organic flow and depth required for top-tier publication. Competent, but not exceptional.</comment>
