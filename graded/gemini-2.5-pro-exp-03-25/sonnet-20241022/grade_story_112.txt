<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation (preserving heritage) is clear and links to the handkerchief, but the transition from 'aimless' to focused feels abrupt, and the 'factually imaginative' trait isn't deeply explored beyond the initial discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The core discovery (hopscotch pattern = cookbook diagrams = seed calendar) feels overly coincidental and slightly contrived, straining coherence despite a clear beginning-middle-end structure within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The atmosphere is effectively rendered; the juxtaposition of the dusty archive with the living, hidden knowledge and the evocative snowflake detail creates a strong, resonant mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance (hidden knowledge, vigilance, heritage) and effective symbolism (handkerchief, seeds), but relies slightly more on stating emotional shifts ('grief and wild joy') than purely showing them.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The central concept avoids common tropes and offers originality, yet the neatness of the interconnected clues (hopscotch, cookbook, handkerchief map) feels slightly formulaic, lacking the messy nuance of genuine discovery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The elements are woven together serviceably to create a cohesive vignette with a clear purpose, though the central mechanism connecting the hopscotch to the specific recipes feels slightly forced rather than organic.</comment>
