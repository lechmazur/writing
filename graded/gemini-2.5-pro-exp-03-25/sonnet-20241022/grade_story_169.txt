<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Madame Vesper is visually distinct and acts consistently with her 'soul-broker' role, but lacks deep internal complexity. Her motivation is functional for the plot but not profoundly explored. The client spirit is underdeveloped, serving primarily as a passive recipient of the sales pitch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear, albeit simple, structure (introduction, persuasion, resolution). The action ('choreograph') and method (reading labels) effectively drive the central scene. However, the persuasion feels somewhat easy and the resolution predictable, lacking significant tension or complication within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The 'floating tea platform' setting and ethereal atmosphere are evocative and well-integrated with the spectral characters and mystical theme. Sensory details are present, but the overall world-building relies on somewhat familiar fantasy tropes (floating structures, perpetual twilight) rather than forging truly unique ground.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story employs decent imagery and presents a clear theme of preserving lost art. The central concept is unique. However, the writing style occasionally leans towards being overly ornate ("grandiose modesty," "spectral business suit shimmering"), and the emotional impact remains somewhat muted. The conflict (client's decision) is resolved neatly but lacks deep resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The core concept (soul real estate, music hidden in bottles) displays originality. However, some phrasing feels slightly elaborate or self-consciously literary ("intone," "glided," "characteristic grandiose modesty"). While avoiding outright clich√©s, it doesn't fully escape a certain archetypal feel (wise, ancient guide) and lacks deep emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story cohesively integrates its required elements, creating a functional and atmospheric vignette. The elements generally serve the narrative. However, it doesn't quite transcend the feeling of being an exercise in combining prompts; it lacks the spark of truly exceptional, unprompted literary fiction. The style is consistent but slightly overwrought.</comment>
