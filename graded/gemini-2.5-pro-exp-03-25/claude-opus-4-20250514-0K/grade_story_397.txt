<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Marcus's "jaded" trait is superficial; Elena's character serves primarily as an expositional device offering a too-convenient resolution, lacking credible internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Intriguing premise and method, but the plot resolution is excessively rapid and relies on a deus ex machina, weakening overall coherence and credibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The central idea of consciousness crystallization via doodles is strikingly original, but the swift, problem-solving reveal feels narratively convenient and somewhat formulaic rather than organically developed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>A compelling, imaginative premise is significantly undermined by a rushed resolution that sacrifices character depth and logical rigor for narrative expediency, falling short of publishable flawlessness.</comment>
