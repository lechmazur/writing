<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The swordsman's emotional arc is clear, but the 'hypnotically rigid' attribute feels underutilized beyond initial setup, not deeply informing his character throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot is efficient with a clever dual use of 'yarn', but the crucial tattoo unraveling sequence itself is summarized, slightly diminishing its dramatic potential.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Offers a refreshingly original premise with inventive details (peacock, jester reveal), though the central 'contrite hero redemption' arc is a familiar narrative structure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Demonstrates strong creative synthesis of disparate elements into a cohesive whole, with the theme of kindness shining through as a particular strength.</comment>
