<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Kess is more symbolic than deeply characterized; 'bard' aspect is underdeveloped relative to their primary actions with cards.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot relies on a convenient 'hidden message' from builders; the pivotal resolution of 'reality's grip loosening' lacks concrete mechanics, feeling asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Ambitious and creative integration of elements, but the conceptual ambition, particularly in the abstract resolution, slightly outstrips the narrative's executed depth.</comment>
