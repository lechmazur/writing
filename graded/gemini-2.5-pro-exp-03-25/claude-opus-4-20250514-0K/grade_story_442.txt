<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's tradesman pragmatism and pessimism are well-established, but the 'edgy' aspect feels less developed; core motivation is strong and clear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Excellent plot arc and pacing within the word limit; the 'vectorization' mechanism via watches leans more on its strong thematic resonance than concrete explanation, which is a slight abstraction but works.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Impressive cohesion of numerous assigned elements into a thought-provoking whole; the story's brevity feels deliberate and impactful, showcasing strong creative synthesis.</comment>
