<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mei is well-realized with clear motivation; however, the "hatefully adored" attribute for the crew is more stated than dynamically shown, and Dr. Harrison serves more as a thematic device than a deeply explored character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot forms a clear arc, effectively driven by Mei's action. The resolution, particularly "word spread," feels somewhat summarized rather than fully demonstrated, slightly diminishing its impact in such a short piece.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The submarine setting and "lights out" timeframe are exceptionally well-integrated, creating a palpable atmosphere of confinement and tension that amplifies Mei's purpose and the story's core concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story excels in its use of symbolism (chopstick) and conveys its theme of resilience effectively. Dialogue is purposeful, though the overall impact leans slightly towards a fable with a clear, directly presented moral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The central premise of a cook as a spiritual guide is fresh and largely avoids clich√©s. However, the "grandmother's cookbook with secret wisdom" is a familiar trope, albeit used serviceably here.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong cohesion, skillfully weaving assigned elements into a purposeful narrative that leaves a lingering sense of quiet wisdom and hope, feeling deliberate in its brevity.</comment>
