<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Assigned motivation ("to discover the power of non-violence") feels like a thematic outcome, not an initial driver; 'meticulously messy' attribute is superficial and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Clear arc and good pacing within the word limit, but the 'drunken confession' mechanism for resolving the central conflict feels somewhat convenient for high-tier literary fiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Highly evocative integration of setting (haunted attic, subway tracks) and timeframe ("between subway stops"), creating a strong, unique, and supportive atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Achieves thematic resonance with often strong imagery and a clear central conflict, but the final thematic explication ("press pain into poetry that healed") is a little too overt for the most discerning reader.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The core premise (memory-infused plants, confession as antidote) is notably original and the style distinct, though the "drunken confession" element has faint trope echoes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cohesive weaving of assigned elements into a poignant narrative, with creative combinations; however, the framing of the initial motivation and an overly explicit thematic summary slightly lessen its flawless aspirations.</comment>
