<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marina's emotional thawing feels somewhat accelerated; the mother's "towering shadow," while influential, lacks direct, deep exploration within the narrative's confines.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc, but the pivotal resolution through the amber's transformation and the sudden "chorus of ghosts" feels symbolically overt and slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Exceptionally strong; the abandoned carnival setting and vivid sensory details create a resonant atmosphere, although the setting itself (abandoned carnival) borders on a familiar trope for mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Impactful imagery and symbolism (e.g., "two seas") are present, yet some climactic supernatural moments are 'told' ("echoed impossibly") or feel abruptly expansive rather than subtly built.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves originality through a unique synthesis of elements, though individual components like the "thawing heart" metaphor or the wise ancestor ghost are somewhat familiar tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and creatively integrates its elements, but the directness of its symbolic resolutions and swift emotional shifts slightly undermines the subtlety expected of flawless literary work.</comment>
