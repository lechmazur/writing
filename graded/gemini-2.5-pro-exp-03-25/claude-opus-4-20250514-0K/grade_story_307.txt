<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Luna's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "quietly rebellious" attribute, while present, could be demonstrated through actions with broader, more tangible impact beyond the individual repairs to fully realize its potential against city-wide cynicism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a clear and satisfying arc with the child's arrival and transformation, but the "neon signs flickering cryptic messages" feel more like affirmations for Luna rather than a direct method she actively wields to "shape" external reality or others' beliefs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The "fairy light repair shop" during the "hush of a city street once a parade ends" creates a highly atmospheric and fitting "ethereal grit" tone, strongly supporting the story's themes through vivid sensory details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (lights, DVD) to convey its theme of hope, but occasionally relies on telling emotions (e.g., "premature disillusionment") or slightly clich√©d similes ("melting like frost") where more nuanced showing would elevate it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The central conceit of mending lights as an act of defiance is refreshingly original, though the narrative structure incorporates familiar tropes like the mentor figure and the disillusioned individual finding hope, without significant subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully weaves its assigned elements into a cohesive and thematically resonant vignette, with the brief length feeling appropriate for the focused encounter and message conveyed.</comment>
