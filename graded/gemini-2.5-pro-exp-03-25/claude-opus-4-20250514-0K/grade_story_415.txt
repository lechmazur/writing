<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Marienne's core trait is intriguing, but her emotional shift feels too rapid given the 20-year rift and Celeste is underdeveloped; dialogue over-explains internal states.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc, but the 20-year conflict's resolution feels too swift, slightly undermining its established gravity and emotional payoff.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The core memory-tasting concept offers originality, but the emotional arc's trajectory towards reconciliation is somewhat predictable, and some descriptive phrasing feels overly "crafted."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated around a compelling central idea, yet the overall execution, particularly in dialogue and nuanced emotional development, lacks top-tier finesse.</comment>
