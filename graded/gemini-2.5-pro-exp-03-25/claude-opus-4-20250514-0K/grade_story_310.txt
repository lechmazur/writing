<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "wide-eyed" descriptor feels dissonant with her established experience and isn't meaningfully explored; her motivation for silence is functional but lacks a deeper, personal origin story beyond a general truism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear and satisfying arc within the word limit, driven effectively by her act of resistance; however, the "reality-forging" hammer's use solely for text alteration feels somewhat narrow for its described potential, despite thematic links.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The underwater city and liminal timeframe are richly imagined and effectively create a unique, immersive atmosphere that strongly supports the narrative's core conflict and the character's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves strong thematic resonance, particularly regarding silence and resistance, and employs impactful symbolism (the hammer, the lost voice); the ending is purposeful and emotionally resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong cohesion with elements serving the narrative effectively, leaving a lingering thematic impact; its brevity feels deliberate, enhancing its fable-like quality.</comment>
