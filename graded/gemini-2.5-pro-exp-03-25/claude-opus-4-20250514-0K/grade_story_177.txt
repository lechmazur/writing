<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Key character trait ("obituaries for the living") is potent, but its pervasive influence on her perceptions or problem-solving prior to the climax is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The crucial epiphany ("Then she understood") feels abrupt; individual choices within the 'labyrinth' lack distinct narrative consequence beyond generic peril of falling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The "giant's bookshelf" setting is a significant imaginative strength, but the broader oppressive world (the giants, their enslavement) remains too abstract to maximize atmospheric dread or stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The core thematic metaphor of an obituary as resurrection is exceptionally strong and original; however, some emotional transitions are explicitly stated (e.g., "despair, then fury") rather than shown through nuanced action or internal experience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Highly original central premise (Resonance Theater and its revival) marks a key strength; however, some descriptive language ("golden light") leans towards conventional fantasy shorthand, slightly dulling its uniqueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The story demonstrates impressive conceptual cohesion and creativity; however, minor executional shortcomings in areas like character depth beyond the core trait and the mechanics of plot resolution prevent flawless status.</comment>
