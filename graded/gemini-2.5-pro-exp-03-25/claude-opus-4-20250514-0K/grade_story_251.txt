<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kira's core ambivalence is clear, but nuanced attributes like "happily sad" are more stated than pervasively shown; dialogue sometimes overly oracular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Coherent as a contemplative vignette, but the primary "action" (defragment) is backstory, leaving the present plot somewhat static in terms of immediate events.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Striking originality in the central premise and the source of power, though some descriptive phrases about character (e.g. "peculiar mixture") feel a bit standard.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Intelligent cohesion of complex ideas, but some elements feel more organically integrated than others, with minor aspects feeling less essential to the core narrative.</comment>
