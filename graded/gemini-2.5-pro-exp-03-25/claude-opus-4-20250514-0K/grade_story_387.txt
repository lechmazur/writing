<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The 'selfless musician' archetype is clearly portrayed and consistently motivated, but lacks deeper individual nuance beyond the demands of his role and the 'last of his kind' trope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, and the 'lunge' action serves as a critical pivot, but the resolution of the 'gravitational maze' feels somewhat expedient and unshown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The world and atmosphere are richly imagined, particularly the auditory elements, though some descriptive phrases ('cathedral of chimes,' 'intangibly tangible') verge on being overly ornate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story achieves thematic resonance and uses imagery effectively, but its profound themes are delivered with a heavy hand, and the repetition of 'savage grace' is a noticeable blemish.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the central concept of the sonic beacon is strikingly original, the narrative relies on some familiar tropes (noble sacrifice, last of his kind) and the highly poetic prose occasionally feels strained, with minor but telling repetitions ("centuries").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates considerable imagination and successfully integrates its core elements, but its stylistic density and reliance on certain archetypes prevent it from achieving flawless, immediately publishable quality without refinement.</comment>
