<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The 'wilderness guide' attribute feels more functional (enabling the dive) than deeply integrated into her core moral processing, and the 'mastering a skill' motivation is somewhat retrofitted onto the primary drive of atonement born from revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc and compelling inciting incident (blanket diary); the revelation's swiftness serves the length but slightly limits nuance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Settings are vivid and thematically resonant, enhancing the action; the 'manic clarity' tone is effectively localized to key descriptive and revelatory moments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional impact and thematic depth regarding inherited guilt and reconciliation, using symbolism and evocative imagery effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The 'crocheted blanket diary' is a distinct point of originality, while the ghostly vision, though fitting, touches on a more common narrative trope for resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>A well-crafted, emotionally resonant story that integrates most elements effectively, though the specific 'motivation' feels more expertly framed by the narrative than organically driving from the outset.</comment>
