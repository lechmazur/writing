<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation is strong and central, but the "clumsily dexterous" attribute feels underdeveloped and slightly dissonant with her described precision, creating a minor inconsistency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong, clear plot arc (setup, confrontation, resolution) effectively executed within the word limit; cause and effect are logical within the story's premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Settings are evocative ("witch's cauldron room" offering ironic contrast) and functional, with the "erased chalkboard" metaphor being a standout atmospheric detail for the imposed silence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Potent central imagery of silence and impactful thematic exploration of listening; a minor inelegance exists in the repetitive phrasing used to describe her dexterity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Highly original core concept (silent retribution via sound manipulation) effectively subverts a somewhat familiar "misunderstood genius/witch" setup; the story largely avoids clich√©s in its execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Most elements are creatively and cohesively integrated, driving a compelling narrative; the "clumsily dexterous" attribute is the least seamlessly incorporated, feeling more stated than deeply shown.</comment>
