<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Her core motivation for mapping is compellingly unique and her ultimate decision is clear, but the "uncertain" attribute feels primarily situational (verdict anxiety) rather than a defining character trait deeply influencing her choices regarding immortality or her life's work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story presents a coherent and satisfying arc with a poignant resolution; however, the "method" (safeguarding through coded scuffs) is not actively employed by the protagonist to "safeguard" the Phoenix knowledge itself. Instead, the scuffs serve as a source of inherited wisdom that guides her to reject that path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating marketplace is exceptionally vivid and atmospheric, providing a memorable and sensorily rich backdrop that contrasts effectively with, and thereby highlights, the protagonist's earthy, grounded motivations and the theme of "mundane miracles."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong thematic development, evocative imagery ("trails that branched like veins," "memories that faded like morning mist"), and a purposeful ending create significant impact; the narrative effectively 'shows' the character's internal conflict and resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The alchemist's specific motivation (mapping mundane miracles) and her ultimate choice offer a fresh perspective on the immortality trope; the prose is distinctive and avoids clich√©, showcasing an individual style rather than formulaic writing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>A thematically resonant and artfully written piece that largely succeeds in integrating its elements, though the connection between the assigned "action" (safeguard Phoenix knowledge) and "method" (via scuffs) is more subverted than directly fulfilled, leading to a nuanced but slightly imperfect cohesion on that specific point.</comment>
