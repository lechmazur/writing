<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear, but the "iconic" attribute feels underdeveloped and the characterization, while sympathetic, leans towards archetypal rather than deeply unique.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Effective pacing and a clear arc within the word limit, but reliance on the overtly stated "unseen forces" as a plot device feels somewhat facile.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative setting and consistently rendered atmosphere ("familiar unknown") strongly support the story's emotional core; sensory details are mostly well-employed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Thematic depth, particularly the nuanced resolution of loneliness into a shared experience, is a significant strength, supported by purposeful symbolism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the core emotional journey resonates, some narrative elements (exiled royal, storm encounter, "unseen forces") and phrases ("eyes that mirrored...") tread familiar territory, lacking true originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Thematic cohesion is strong and the resolution is poignant; however, a slight over-reliance on convenient plot devices and some common tropes narrowly misses the mark for "flawless."</comment>
