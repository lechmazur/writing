<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lucky's core corruption arc is clear, but the "gambler" trait feels superficial, and the transition from "typically never sought power" to obsession is rapid. His final confession, however, is potent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc, but the assigned "method" (spin-the-bottle) is not the method for the assigned "action" (duplicate), creating a structural dissonance with the prompt's constraints despite the story's internal coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic setting and timeframe are effectively realized and atmospheric. The "cheerful despair" tone is mostly embodied by Lucky's facade rather than being a pervasive world element.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses literary devices and a strong, poignant ending to explore themes of self-deception and the cost of power, leaving a memorable impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative avoids overt AI tells and offers a nuanced emotional climax, though the core "power corrupts" trope is familiar. Freshness comes from element combination rather than wholly original thematic exploration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is generally cohesive and creatively combines its elements, but the imperfect integration of the assigned "method" with the "action" (as defined by the prompt instructions for Q2) is a notable flaw under strict adherence to constraints.</comment>
