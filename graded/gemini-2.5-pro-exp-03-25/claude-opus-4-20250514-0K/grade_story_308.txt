<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strength: The "bashful" attribute creates compelling internal conflict against her profound, inherited duty. Weakness: The "ferocity" aspect of her commitment, while stated as part of her voice, could be more dynamically dramatized through varied actions beyond her practice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strength: Achieves a clear and satisfying emotional arc (anticipation, internal conflict, resolution) within the tight word limit. Weakness: The assigned "flinch" action is a subtle character beat; the plot is more significantly driven by Master Chen's subsequent request.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strength: The "floating yoga studio" amid "festival preparations" offers a unique, evocative setting that aligns well with the themes of dance and remembrance. Weakness: "The soothing tides," while atmospherically present and metaphorically linked ("nature's metronome"), feel somewhat less dynamically integral to the core thematic structure or character choices compared to other more active elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Strength: The central concept of preserving life through danced execution is exceptionally original and emotionally resonant, creating profound subtext about memory, art, and the nature of a "gift."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Strength: Demonstrates striking originality in its core premise and execution, with nuanced emotional portrayal (e.g., "benign ferocity," bashfulness coexisting with solemn duty) that avoids clich√© and feels deeply human rather than formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strength: Displays remarkable cohesion, artfully weaving numerous, potentially disparate, assigned elements into a poignant, focused, and memorable narrative that feels complete and purposeful despite its brevity.</comment>
