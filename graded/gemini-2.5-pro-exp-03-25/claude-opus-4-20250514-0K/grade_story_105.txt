<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character arc is present, but the "strangely trustworthy" attribute feels more like a revealed discovery than an actively demonstrated trait influencing early actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Coherent micro-arc and effective "jolt," but the final decision to board the carpet feels slightly abrupt after the revelation, even for a short piece.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Excellent synthesis of unique setting ("witch's flying carpet garage restroom") and evocative atmosphere ("frantic peace," "half-lit corridor").</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original combination of fantastical and mundane elements; "frantic peace" offers a nuanced emotional portrayal, largely avoiding clich√©.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Thematic depth and clever integration of elements are commendable, creating a memorable vignette that largely overcomes its constraints.</comment>
