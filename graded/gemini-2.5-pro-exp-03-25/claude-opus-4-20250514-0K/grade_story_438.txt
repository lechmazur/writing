<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's "vague" descriptor feels inconsistent with her sharp ultimate focus; "discreetly flamboyant" aspect is well-realized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot is propelled effectively by the "override" action, but the polaroid-based discovery method feels somewhat contrived for a top-tier piece.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lab setting strongly contrasts with mystic elements, creating good atmosphere; however, the "last star map is drawn" timeframe feels superficially integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a potent thematic blend of science and mysticism; the "mad seers" revelation, however, leans on a familiar trope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The conceptual blend is original and intriguing; however, the prose occasionally verges on ornate, and some plot devices (e.g., convenient clues) are not entirely fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story demonstrates ambitious thematic exploration and is largely cohesive; minor plot contrivances and stylistic choices prevent it from reaching a "flawless" standard for immediate top-tier publication.</comment>
