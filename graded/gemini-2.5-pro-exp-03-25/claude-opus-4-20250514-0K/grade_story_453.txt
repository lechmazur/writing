<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The character's distinct voice and evolving motivation ("no longer sought escape") are compelling. The "foolhardy" attribute is justified by her ambitious undertaking, though her methodology becomes more one of profound adaptation than recklessness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is a focused situational character study with a clear internal arc. The "decree" of seasonal change serves as an effective, albeit simple, external catalyst. Coherence and pacing are excellent within the concise format.</comment>
