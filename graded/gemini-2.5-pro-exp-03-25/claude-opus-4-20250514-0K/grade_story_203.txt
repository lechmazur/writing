<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's shift from prolonged confusion/stage fright to sudden cosmic understanding and purpose, including the perfectly tailored explanation for her fear, feels psychologically rushed and overly convenient for the word count.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "sound of a key" serves as a catalyst for revelation, but its direct classification as the *method* for the action "submerge" (in work) is a conceptual stretch; the plot's density leads to some connections feeling asserted rather than fully developed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "orbital debris" setting is masterfully used, integral to the plot's mechanics and symbolism. However, the "amid toy assembly" timeframe applies to a backstory inciting incident, not directly to the primary action in the debris field, creating a slight structural awkwardness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story's central conceit—redefining "exorcism" to concern possibilities and failed futures, and "spirits" as extinguished timelines—is highly original and thematically potent, executed with evocative symbolism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative offers a genuinely original subversion of the "exorcist" trope. However, minor repetitive thematic phrasing (e.g., "ashes of 'never'") and a somewhat stock "knowing smile" slightly temper its claim to flawless originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates significant creative ambition in weaving its assigned elements into a largely cohesive and thought-provoking narrative. The primary weakness stems from the extreme density of conceptual reveals, which occasionally makes developments feel compressed or asserted rather than fully organically unfolded.</comment>
