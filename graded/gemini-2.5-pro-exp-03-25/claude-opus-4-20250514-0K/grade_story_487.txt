<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong core concept for Brutus, but the "docile" aspect feels somewhat latent until the climax, and the internal journey to "mythmaker" is more implied by the outcome than deeply explored during the process.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the arc is complete, the reliance on a clichéd "shredded map" as a key plot driver and the somewhat symbolic mechanics of the baton's specific power weaken its claim to flawless construction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse labyrinth is vividly realized, but some thematic elements like the foreign labels feel slightly didactic, and the drum solos, while atmospheric, could be more deeply interwoven with the core narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story achieves significant thematic depth and uses literary devices effectively, but minor instances of telling over showing (e.g., "enforced violence") and a slightly exposition-heavy opening detract from perfection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The central premise of Brutus and his unique resurrection is highly original, but the narrative employs a clichéd plot device (treasure map) and minor repetitive phrasing ("disturbingly calm"), hinting at areas for refinement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates considerable creative integration of its elements and achieves a memorable impact, but a few conventional choices (notably the map) and slight stylistic stumbles prevent it from reaching "flawless" status.</comment>
