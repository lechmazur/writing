<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character transformation feels somewhat abrupt and overly reliant on Raj's wisdom, lessening the impact of Marcus's internal agency before the pivotal handshake.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Coherent arc and effective pacing for its length, but the resolution of deep-seated paranoia through a single dialogue exchange feels convenient for a top-tier piece.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The ancient temple setting and its associated imagery are effectively evoked, creating a strong, fitting atmosphere that enhances the narrative's mystical quality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Thematic resonance is present, but Raj's dialogue is overly expository, and some figurative language ("struck like lightning," "open book," "wisdom through osmosis") is unoriginal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The combination of specific elements (blotter, constellations) offers freshness, but the underlying mentor-guided epiphany structure is a familiar trope, diluting claims of high originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements are generally well-integrated to form a cohesive narrative, but the story doesn't consistently achieve the profound originality or sharpness in execution demanded by the highest literary echelons.</comment>
