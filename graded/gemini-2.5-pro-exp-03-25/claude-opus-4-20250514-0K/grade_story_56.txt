<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The 'invisible allies' feel like an external crutch for characterization, and 'swindler' misaligns slightly with his altruistic motive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot relies on a convenient trope (meet-cute) and a too-quick character realization; the 'invisible allies' concept feels thinly integrated into the core mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative and original setting is a significant strength, powerfully blending nature and ruin with the technological remnants.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong central symbolism (price tag) and theme, but Clara's rapid full comprehension feels more told than organically shown, slightly undermining impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Core idea (blank price tag) is original, but reliance on the meet-cute trope and the somewhat generic 'invisible allies' detracts from peak freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Generally cohesive with a strong central image, but the 'invisible allies' element feels more like a constraint fulfilled than an indispensable, organic narrative necessity.</comment>
