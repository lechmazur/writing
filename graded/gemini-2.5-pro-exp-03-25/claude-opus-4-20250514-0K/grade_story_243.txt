<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The 'necromancer' aspect is creatively realized within the digital theme, but the 'jumpy' attribute feels perfunctory, influencing only minor physical reactions rather than shaping deeper character choices or his investigative approach.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot arc is complete and engaging for its length, but the critical discovery of the High Programmer's weakness (maintenance cycles) lacks a clear causal link to the mural's revealed information, appearing as a convenient intuition rather than a logical deduction from the evidence presented.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The "retro video game world" is exceptionally well-realized and intrinsically linked to every plot point and thematic concern, creating a vivid and consistent atmosphere that perfectly supports the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance achieved by originally blending digital concepts with necromancy; the core metaphor of "deleted code" as erased individuals is particularly impactful, creating genuine subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High originality in its core premise and the unique blending of genres; however, the crucial plot point regarding system maintenance cycles is deduced too conveniently, bordering on an authorial shortcut rather than organic character discovery from the described mural.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Very creative and cohesive in its unique world-building and thematic exploration; however, a key deductive leap by the protagonist regarding the villain's specific vulnerability feels insufficiently supported by the narrative's established evidence, a notable flaw for top-tier publication.</comment>
