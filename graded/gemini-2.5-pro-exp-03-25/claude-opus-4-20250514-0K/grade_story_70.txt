<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The character's arc from "uptight scribe" to transformed individual is central and pronounced; however, the sheer rapidity of this change after "decades of restraint," culminating in a "bellow," slightly strains credulity even with a fantastical catalyst.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot offers a clear and satisfying arc within the word limit, but the mechanism of "analyzing the leftover adhesive" to trigger detailed, world-altering visions is a narratively convenient fantastical leap that feels somewhat contrived as a primary driver for exposition and change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting – a "glass parasite" greenhouse amid gravestones "like broken teeth" – is exceptionally evocative and masterfully underpins the story's themes of intertwined death/growth and buried innovation, contributing significantly to the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong craft through potent symbolism (the Tesla bulb as beacon, ledgers as tombstones) and impactful imagery, leading to a thematically resonant conclusion that effectively 'shows' rather than merely 'tells' the character's internal shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A fresh amalgamation of Tesla-esque speculative science with witchcraft and a bureaucratic awakening offers a degree of originality; the psychometric adhesive is a notable invention, and the prose generally avoids cliché with specific imagery ("glass parasite").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative achieves impressive thematic cohesion and emotional impact for its brevity, skillfully integrating its core elements; however, minor reliance on convenient plot devices and the swiftness of the character's profound change prevent it from reaching flawless execution.</comment>
