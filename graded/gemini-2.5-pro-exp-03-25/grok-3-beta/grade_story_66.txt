<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The character's motivation (finding belonging) is clear and drives his actions (reconstructing stories, carbonizing). However, the assigned attribute "dizzyingly grounded" feels more stated than demonstrated, lacking deep integration into his behaviour or internal monologue. His actions align with being a "quiet deserter," but his distinct voice is absent due to the third-person narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot structure achieves a discernible arc within the word limit, moving from sanctuary-seeking to a form of resolution. However, the transition to the carbonization method via the plants' guidance feels somewhat abrupt and convenient, weakening the cause-and-effect chain. The pacing accelerates quickly towards the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The "plant communication study" setting is highly effective, creating a unique and palpable atmosphere that strongly supports the character's isolation and the theme of non-verbal connection. Sensory details related to the plants are well-used. The "jigsaw puzzles of time" timeframe, while evocative, is slightly abstract but complements the fragmented mental state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully uses symbolism (mirror, masks, carbonization) to explore themes of trauma, memory, and belonging, achieving notable subtext. However, the central conflict remains largely internal and its resolution feels slightly too neat ("nowhere was enough"). The craft is strong, but the emotional impact is somewhat muted by the slightly detached tone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The premise is original, avoiding common tropes. However, some descriptive language ("whispering ferns," "vibrating ivy," "green murmurs") borders on overly familiar nature descriptions or slightly purple prose. While not overtly formulaic, the narrative progression follows a relatively predictable path of trauma processing towards acceptance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates creativity in cohesively integrating disparate elements like plant communication, carbonization, and shattered masks into a thematic whole. The elements generally serve the narrative, though some feel more organically integrated than others. The brevity works, but minor weaknesses in plot logic and character depth prevent it from reaching the highest tier.</comment>
