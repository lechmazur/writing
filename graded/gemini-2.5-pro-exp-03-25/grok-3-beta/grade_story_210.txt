<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but standard; the 'amiable' trait is asserted rather than demonstrated effectively through action or voice. The 'doubly singular' attribute feels explicitly stated and somewhat awkward, lacking organic integration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The plot structure provides a basic arc (waiting to resolution), but the resolution via radio transmission feels convenient and externally imposed rather than arising from the character's direct actions within the lighthouse. Pacing is adequate, but the overall plot lacks significant tension or complexity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is effectively established using conventional haunted setting tropes (whispers, shadows, creaks), strongly supporting the narrative mood. However, the sensory details, while present, lack exceptional specificity or originality to elevate it beyond genre expectations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story uses familiar literary devices (crossword metaphor, symbolic setting) competently but without remarkable freshness. The central theme is clear but presented straightforwardly; subtext is minimal, and the emotional impact remains muted due to a somewhat predictable trajectory and resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The prose occasionally dips into slightly ornate or generic phrasing ("ghostly whispers clung," "erratic pulse"). While avoiding major AI tells, the combination of elements (haunted place, curious scholar, historical secrets) feels somewhat formulaic, lacking a truly distinctive voice or surprising narrative turn.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story successfully incorporates the required elements, but some feel more like checklist items ("doubly singular," "humble rebellion") than organic parts of the narrative. The overall piece feels competently constructed but lacks the seamless integration and unique spark required for top-tier publication.</comment>
