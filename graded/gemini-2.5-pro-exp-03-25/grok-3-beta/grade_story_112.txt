<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The motivation (preserve recipes) is clear and drives the action, but the initial 'aimless' trait feels contradicted by the immediate weight of the handkerchief and ancestral longing. The 'factually imaginative' attribute is stated but weakly demonstrated; the hopscotch interpretation feels more convenient than a deep character trait reveal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The plot structure achieves a basic arc within the word limit, but hinges critically on the hopscotch board discovery, which feels contrived and overly convenient as a method for uncovering complex tribal cooking rituals. The cause-effect chain is strained at this central point, weakening overall coherence despite decent pacing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The archive setting is effectively evoked with sensory details and strongly supports the atmosphere and theme. However, the timeframe ('in the hush as a snowflake melts on warm skin') feels abstract and poorly integrated, adding a poetic touch but lacking tangible connection to the setting or plot progression.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story successfully uses symbolism (handkerchief, grilling) and explores a clear theme of cultural preservation. However, the writing occasionally slips into slightly overwrought phrasing ("mournful elation," "somber thrill"), and the central conflict's resolution relies on the less-than-convincing hopscotch element, slightly diminishing the overall impact and subtextual depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the combination of elements (archive, hopscotch, recipes) offers originality, the execution suffers from some overly literary phrasing bordering on purple prose and a central plot device (hopscotch code) that feels formulaic in its convenience. Emotional states are sometimes stated directly rather than purely shown, and the reasoning behind the code feels more plot-serving than organically derived.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story attempts cohesion, and most elements serve the narrative, particularly the setting, object, and motivation. However, the integration of the hopscotch method feels forced, creating a noticeable strain. While the brief length feels deliberate, the reliance on this weaker element prevents the story from achieving the seamless, high-impact quality required.</comment>
