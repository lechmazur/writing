<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and drives the action, but the 'unusually usual' attribute feels underdeveloped and doesn't significantly shape the character beyond a brief description. Character depth relies heavily on the stated motivation rather than nuanced portrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, using the 'decay' action thematically. However, the resolution feels slightly abrupt; overcoming a 'deep-seated prejudice' via one encounter and a symbolic object strains credulity for top-tier literary fiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport setting effectively creates an atmosphere of 'ancient novelty' and decay, strongly supporting the story's themes and Mara's internal state. Sensory details are present, though the connection between a phantom *train* punch and a *spaceport* feels slightly arbitrary despite the narrative justification.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (punch, decay) and establishes a clear theme of connection overcoming isolation. However, the reliance on the symbolic object's 'humming approval' slightly weakens the impact of Mara's agency, and the prose occasionally borders on being overly descriptive rather than purely evocative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>While the combination of elements offers originality, the execution exhibits some familiar tropes (mysterious guide, symbolic object). Phrases like 'unusually usual' and the somewhat predictable arc hint at formulaic constraints. Emotional nuance could be deeper; it relies more on stated feelings and symbolic acts than subtle character work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates creativity in weaving disparate elements into a cohesive whole, largely serving the narrative. The brief length works for the focused arc. However, minor weaknesses in character depth, plot resolution speed, and occasional stylistic choices prevent it from reaching flawless execution.</comment>
