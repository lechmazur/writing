<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The character concept is intriguing, but the 'rationally impulsive' attribute feels asserted rather than demonstrated, and the motivation linking stage acting to solving ancient murders is somewhat tenuous and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear, albeit conventional, mystery arc (clue, investigation, resolution) that functions within the word limit, but the resolution feels slightly abrupt and overly neat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere and setting are vividly evoked, but the 'after the last drop of oil' timeframe feels like superficial set dressing, lacking deep integration with the core narrative or character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story attempts thematic depth (truth/art) and uses symbolism (sunlight, chameleon), but the execution is hampered by prose bordering on overwrought and a mix of showing versus telling emotion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>While the core premise offers originality, certain phrases ('rationally impulsive', 'anxious serenity') and the stated rather than nuanced emotion feel artificial, hinting at formulaic construction rather than authentic voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion and creatively combines most elements, but weaknesses in character attribute integration, timeframe relevance, and stylistic choices prevent it from reaching top-tier quality.</comment>
