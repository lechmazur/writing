<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The 'burnt-out general' feels somewhat archetypal; the 'rationally absurd' attribute is stated more than organically embodied, weakening conviction and distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While possessing an arc, the resolution via shared notes feels slightly simplistic and convenient given the depth of trauma implied by "endless wars."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong atmosphere and effective use of setting (photos), but the 'dark matter' aspect feels more like superficial set dressing than deeply integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Relies heavily on explicit thematic statements ("fear thrives on isolation," "Renewal... wasn't about erasing fear"); showing is undermined by telling, reducing literary impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Some phrasing ("nebulous horrors," "shimmering obsidian," "rogue comet") leans towards genre clich√© or slightly purple prose, lacking a truly unique authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements are integrated serviceably, but the execution doesn't reach the highest literary standard due to reliance on archetypes and telling over showing, hindering immediate publishability.</comment>
