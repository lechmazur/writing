<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation feels split between vendetta and discovering the continent, slightly muddling the character's core drive; the shift triggered by the locket isn't fully convincing within the short space.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The core concept of "anonymous kindness" directly contradicts the character's stated motivation and tone ("ardent scorn," "vendetta"), creating significant plot incoherence and undermining the logic of her actions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The setting and atmosphere are evocative ("forgotten market," "cobwebs"), but rely slightly too much on stated emotions ("ardent scorn") rather than purely atmospheric rendering to convey the tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the central image of vengeful candy sculpting is striking, the story relies heavily on explicitly stating emotions ("scorn," "contempt," "wrath") rather than consistently showing them through nuanced action or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The premise is original, but the execution feels somewhat formulaic in its emotional beats ("furnace of grief," "storm of contempt"), and the rebels' simplistic reaction to the clues lacks human nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Cohesion suffers due to the poorly integrated "anonymous kindness" concept clashing with the dominant tone and motivation; the elements feel somewhat forced together rather than organically serving a unified story.</comment>
