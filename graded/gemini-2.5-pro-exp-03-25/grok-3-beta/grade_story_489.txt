<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The 'unseen observer' remains entirely spectral and underdeveloped, lacking agency beyond the single action. The assigned attribute 'aggressively kind' feels contradictory and is asserted rather than demonstrated; the act of flinging a whistle seems more desperate or symbolic than 'kind' in any meaningful way. Motivation is stated but lacks nuanced exploration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but exceedingly simple for literary fiction. The 'fling' action serves as the climax, triggered somewhat conveniently by the whale's call. While it achieves a beginning-middle-end structure within the word limit, the resolution is weak, relying on stated hope rather than narrative impact. Pacing is adequate, but the overall arc feels slight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is effectively established, leveraging the haunted lighthouse setting well. Sensory details related to the sea and the watch room are present. The setting supports the character's motivation (preserving sea traditions). However, the connection between a 'basic plastic whistle' and 'ancient rites' feels slightly jarring without further justification or exploration of the contrast.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story attempts symbolism (whistle, whale song) but leans heavily on stating its themes ('undercurrent of wisdom', 'rescue ancient traditions') rather than allowing them to emerge organically. The writing style occasionally dips into melodrama ('fierce need', 'relentless compassion', 'brazen calm'). The ending lacks resonance, feeling more like an abrupt stop than a purposeful conclusion. Showing is sacrificed for telling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Relies on familiar tropes (haunted lighthouse, forgotten traditions, spectral observer). Phrases like 'shadows clung', 'mournful howl', 'slipping into oblivion', 'hum with latent power' border on clich√©. The juxtaposition of 'aggressively kind' and 'brazen calm' feels artificial. While not overtly formulaic, it lacks a truly distinctive voice or surprising narrative turn.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story struggles to cohesively integrate all elements at a high literary level. The attribute ('aggressively kind') and the object's material ('plastic') feel less organically woven than the setting or motivation. The brevity feels somewhat limiting rather than deliberately impactful. While functional, it doesn't transcend the feeling of being an exercise in combining prompts.</comment>
