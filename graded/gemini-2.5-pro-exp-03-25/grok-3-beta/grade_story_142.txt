<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent (broke aristocrat seeking recipes), but the character remains somewhat archetypal, lacking deep nuance or a truly distinctive voice within the narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, but the central discovery (grove matching illustration) feels overly convenient and predictable for top-tier literary fiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is strongly evoked through the effective integration of the haunted setting, timeframe, and tone ('blurry vividness'), though sensory details could be sharper.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Competent use of symbolism (coaster, illustration) and theme (legacy), but the writing style occasionally dips into purple prose ("elixirs of flavor") and lacks significant subtext or emotional depth shown through action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Relies heavily on familiar tropes (broke aristocrat, haunted setting, quest) without sufficient subversion. Prose feels somewhat self-conscious and ornate ("blurry vividness" repeated), lacking the freshness and subtlety of truly original work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The elements are integrated cohesively, but the story feels constructed around them rather than organically arising. It fulfills the prompt's requirements competently but lacks a unique spark or lingering impact.</comment>
