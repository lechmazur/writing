<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The 'stage fright' attribute feels inconsistent, particularly when Elara's voice becomes 'surprisingly steady'. Her motivation ('sculpt possibility') is overly abstract and stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced action or internal thought. The wildflowers serve their symbolic purpose adequately but border on cliché.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The plot trigger (distant access panel mimicking a key) feels contrived and convenient. The core action ('submerge') remains entirely metaphorical, lacking tangible progression or specific exorcism mechanics. While an arc exists, it feels thin due to the abstract nature of the central conflict's resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of the sterile sci-fi setting (orbital debris, toy assembly) with the organic/supernatural (wildflowers, exorcism) creates initial interest, but the connection feels somewhat superficial, lacking deep thematic resonance or justification for *why* this exorcism happens *here*.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Imagery like 'cosmic dandruff' is effective, but phrasing such as 'sculpt possibility from the ashes of “never”' borders on purple prose. The theme of overcoming lies/fate is present but delivered too explicitly. Dialogue is minimal and serves its purpose adequately but lacks distinction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the sci-fi exorcist concept offers some novelty, the execution leans on familiar tropes (fragile natural object as anchor, generically raspy demon voice). The language, while avoiding obvious AI tells, sometimes feels self-consciously literary rather than possessing a unique, authentic voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story struggles to make the disparate assigned elements feel organically connected; their combination seems more like fulfilling a checklist than arising naturally from a core idea. Cohesion exists, but it feels surface-level, and the story doesn't quite transcend the sum of its required parts.</comment>
