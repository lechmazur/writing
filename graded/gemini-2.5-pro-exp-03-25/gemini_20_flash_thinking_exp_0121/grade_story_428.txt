<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The character's core motivation (banish doubt/escape past) is clear, but the assigned attribute "rarely authentic" is merely stated, not demonstrated or explored, weakening the portrayal. His actions are consistent with the prepper persona, but lack nuanced connection to the 'city planner' past beyond simple contrast.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.0</grade><comment>The story lacks meaningful plot progression; it's a static scene focused on internal thoughts. The assigned action "debase" is an internal intention, not an external driver. The timeframe ("at the second a handshake...") feels awkwardly inserted and disconnected from the present action. No discernible arc within the word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is effectively established with good sensory details (incense, damp stone), contrasting the temple setting with the character's past. However, the specific choice of an *Indian* temple feels arbitrary without justification linking it to the "broken constellations," slightly undermining world coherence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (ink blotter, temple) is present but somewhat heavy-handed. The central conflict is internal (doubt vs. will) but relies heavily on telling rather than showing emotion. Repetitive phrasing ("debase," "daring caution") detracts from the craft. The theme of transformation is clear but lacks subtlety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The story exhibits repetitive phrasing ("rarely authentic," "daring caution," "debase") and relies on stating emotions ("heart pounded," "felt"), suggesting formulaic writing. While the premise combines unusual elements, the execution feels somewhat generic in its internal monologue structure and use of clich√©s ("self-imposed chains").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Cohesion suffers due to the forced integration of several elements (notably the timeframe and attribute), which feel more like checklist items than organic parts of the narrative. The style aims high but is marred by repetition, hindering clarity and impact. The brief length feels like an undeveloped snapshot.</comment>
