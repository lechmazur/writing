<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and drives the plot, but the character's internal shift feels abrupt, and the 'fractured memories' aspect remains underdeveloped, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The plot structure achieves a basic arc, but the discovery via sun trails feels slightly convenient, and the pacing rushes the crucial realization and climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The setting and object are well-integrated, creating a suitable atmosphere, but sensory details lack the exceptional richness needed for top-tier immersion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>1.5</grade><comment>The story suffers critically from excessive, unnatural repetition of assigned elements, feeling formulaic and robotic rather than authentic or original; language becomes overwrought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>2.0</grade><comment>Cohesion is attempted, but the forced integration and constant repetition of elements make the story feel constructed *around* them, hindering organic flow and overall quality.</comment>
