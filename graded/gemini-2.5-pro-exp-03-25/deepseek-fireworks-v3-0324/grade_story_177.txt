<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Motivation (obituaries for the living) is clear but lacks deep exploration; the 'rebellious' attribute feels asserted ("rebellion was his habit") rather than consistently demonstrated through nuanced action. Character voice is absent in the third-person narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc within the word limit, driven by the 'manifest' action via the organ. However, the discovery of the mask and organ chamber feels convenient, and the resolution where soldiers simply falter is abrupt and lacks dramatic weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The giant's bookshelf setting is evocative and works with the revolution timeframe for tension. However, the 'lucid frenzy' tone is only partially achieved during the organ sequence, not consistently maintained. Sensory details are present but not exceptional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story presents an intriguing concept (living obituaries) and uses symbolism (mask, organ). The central conflict is clear. However, the emotional impact is muted, and the subtext about art/memory versus revolution isn't deeply explored, remaining somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>While the core concept is original, some phrasing ("lucid frenzy," "rebellion of memory") borders on overly stylized or purple prose. The plot relies on familiar fantasy tropes (magical artifact, hidden powerful location) without significant subversion. Emotion is often stated or conveyed through slightly generic actions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story incorporates the elements, but they don't always feel seamlessly integrated; the 'labyrinth of choices' feels particularly tacked on. The narrative serves the elements adequately but lacks the organic feel of a story where elements arise naturally from the core idea. It leaves a slight impression, but not a profound one.</comment>
