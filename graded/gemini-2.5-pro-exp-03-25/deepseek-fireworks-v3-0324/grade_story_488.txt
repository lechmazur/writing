<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation ("outshine reflection") is clear and drives the action, but the character remains somewhat archetypal, lacking deeper nuance or a truly distinct voice beyond serving the central concept.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is efficient within the word count, achieving a clear arc. However, the building's collapse coinciding precisely with the summoning's peak feels slightly contrived, weakening the cause-and-effect logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The "quantum beach" setting and "hush before demolition" timeframe create a strong, unique atmosphere, effectively enhanced by sensory details (ozone, unseen energy). The tone aligns well with the concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong use of imagery ("sand like fractured time," "reflection sharp as shattered glass") and symbolism (map, reflection). The theme of ambition's cost is evident, but the overall impact stops short of profound originality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While avoiding overt clich√©s, some descriptive language ("fractured time," "ozone and forgotten memories") borders on familiar genre conventions. The core concept is handled competently but isn't radically innovative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The elements are generally well-integrated, particularly the setting, motivation, and action. The story feels cohesive, though the family holiday detail feels slightly less essential than other components.</comment>
