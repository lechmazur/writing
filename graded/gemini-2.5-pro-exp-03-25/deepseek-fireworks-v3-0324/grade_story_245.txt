<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The transition from 'irate' to seeking purification via 'heart's revolt' feels abrupt and somewhat externally imposed by the concept rather than organically developed. Motivation shifts too quickly without sufficient internal exploration for this level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc, but the tea-leaf map revelation feels convenient. Pacing is functional but lacks the nuance expected; the jogging frame feels slightly mechanical around the central moment of pause.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere of the abandoned spaceport is effectively rendered with good sensory details. However, the 'abstractly physical' attribute feels underdeveloped and not fully integrated into the world's feel.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Uses strong imagery (dust, chopstick carving) and symbolism effectively. The theme of redemption is clear, but some phrasing feels slightly self-conscious ('biting sincerity'), and the ending, while purposeful, leans towards a familiar trope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt AI tells but occasionally uses dramatic phrasing that borders on clich√© ('biting as the vacuum of space'). The core concept isn't entirely novel, and the emotional nuance could be deeper rather than stated via concepts like 'heart's revolt'.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story incorporates the elements, but the synthesis isn't seamless; 'abstractly physical' and 'during jogging' feel less integral. It functions as a story fulfilling constraints but doesn't quite transcend them into a truly exceptional, standalone piece.</comment>
