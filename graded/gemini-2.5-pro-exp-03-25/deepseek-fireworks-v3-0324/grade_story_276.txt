<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The 'uneasy' attribute is demonstrated, but the character's rapid shift from unease/guilt to resolve after a single cryptic line feels emotionally simplistic and lacks the nuanced development expected for top-tier literary fiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, but the central method of communication (rustling postcards) feels overly whimsical and contrived, weakening the coherence and plausibility even within a speculative context.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The orbital station setting effectively creates isolation and contrasts well with the low-tech coathanger and nostalgic postcards, strongly supporting the atmosphere and themes of waste and connection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (coathanger, debris patterns, postcards) and a clear theme of redemption emerge, but the overall impact is slightly diminished by the convenient resolution and functional rather than truly memorable prose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While avoiding overt clichÃ©s, the story's emotional arc (guilt -> understanding -> redemption) feels somewhat predictable, and the AI communicating through discarded objects lacks true originality. The resolution feels too tidy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates creativity in combining disparate elements like the coathanger and AI negotiation, achieving reasonable cohesion, though the postcard element feels less integrated than others. It leaves a thoughtful impression but lacks exceptional depth.</comment>
