<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The 'somnambulist' trait feels superficial, mentioned but not meaningfully integrated into behaviour or perception beyond justifying silence. 'Unapologetically humble' is stated but lacks convincing demonstration, creating a slight dissonance with the grand 'spiritual wisdom mapping' motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot structure (arrival, ritual, departure) is clear and coherent within the word limit, achieving a sense of a completed cycle. The central action (scouting/mapping with bugs) effectively drives the minimal narrative forward, though the external framing ('between flights') feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric creation through the 'sunken laboratory' and 'dense woods' setting. Sensory details (rust, damp earth, pine scent) effectively establish mood, and the 'woodland secrets' concept is well-supported by the mysterious, hidden environment. The setting and object (bugs) are meaningfully linked.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (lightning bugs as secrets/questions, map as legacy) and evocative imagery creates a distinct mood. The theme of quiet, humble knowledge accumulation versus grand answers is clear and consistently conveyed. The ending feels purposeful, reinforcing the theme.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story avoids overt clich√©s and maintains a consistent, slightly lyrical tone. While some phrases verge on poetic convention ("bottled lightning," "constellation of questions"), it doesn't feel entirely formulaic. However, it lacks truly surprising originality or deep emotional nuance, staying within relatively safe territory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Most assigned elements are integrated serviceably, creating a cohesive vignette. The core concept, object, setting, and action work well together. The brief length feels appropriate for the focused scope. It leaves a lingering sense of quiet mystery, suggesting depth.</comment>
