<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The character is more of a functional archetype ("frazzled courier") than a developed personality; her motivation is stated clearly but her internal voice lacks distinction, and the core attribute "strongly weak" feels applied rather than embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story follows a coherent but predictable vignette structure. The central method of "tracking" is relegated to exposition rather than being an active part of the plot, and the "between games" timeframe feels superficial and adds little tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The world-building is visually dense and intriguing, but it reads like a collection of high-concept aesthetics (holograms, ancient stones, festival) that haven't quite coalesced into a fully grounded, lived-in setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story suffers from a lack of subtlety. It relies on explicitly stating its core themes and emotional beats ("jubilant despair," "strongly weak," "bending but never breaking"), undermining the power of its otherwise effective symbolism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>While the concept is unique, the execution relies on overly ornate, "purple" prose and states emotions directly ("A wave of jubilant despair washed over her"), which feels formulaic and lacks the nuance of high-caliber literary fiction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story is a competent and cohesive assembly of its required parts, but it never transcends the feeling of being a well-executed writing exercise. The author's hand is too visible, making the narrative feel constructed rather than organic.</comment>
