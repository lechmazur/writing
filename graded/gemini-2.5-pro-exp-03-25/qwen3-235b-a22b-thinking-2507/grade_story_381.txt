<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is poignantly realized through memory and symbolism, but the "necromancer" label feels like a slightly under-realized genre flourish, primarily serving to justify his muteness rather than being fully integrated into his present actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is a masterfully handled vignette; it achieves a complete and satisfying emotional arc within the tight word limit. The pacing is reflective and purposeful, perfectly suiting the story's introspective nature.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's absolute triumph. The synthesis of a high-tech, desolate future with the warmth of personal, analog nostalgia is rendered with superb sensory detail, creating a deeply immersive and resonant world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The literary craft is exceptional. The story operates on a deep layer of subtext, using potent symbolism (the cap, the film) and a powerful central metaphor (mapping as memory) to convey profound grief and determination without a single misplaced word.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept is startlingly original, but the authenticity is slightly marred by the mandated repetition of key phrases ("sound of resolve," "scarcely abundant"), which feels more like adherence to a prompt than organic authorial choice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The piece demonstrates remarkable cohesion, weaving a disparate collection of elements into a powerful, moving narrative. It transcends its constraints to become a thoughtful, resonant story that lingers long after reading.</comment>
