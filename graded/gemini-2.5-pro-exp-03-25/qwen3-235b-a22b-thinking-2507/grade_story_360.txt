<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The plot relies entirely on a 'deus ex machina' (the dew drop), a significant structural weakness that feels contrived and unmotivated by character action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the necromancer concept is fresh, the narrative leans on a formulaic 'magical solution' and prose that at times becomes overwrought, sacrificing originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Thematic cohesion is strong, but the story as a whole is critically undermined by its simplistic plot device and heavy-handed delivery of its message.</comment>
