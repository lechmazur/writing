<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The character's "inwardly social" attribute is well-realized and drives his behavior, but the "rattled exorcist" element feels like superficial flavoring. His past as an exorcist is stated but doesn't meaningfully inform his specific actions or problem-solving approach beyond a generic sense of being "rattled."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is exceptionally coherent and well-paced for the word count, with a clear arc. However, it relies on the very conventional structure of a linear puzzle-box narrative (find clue A, then B, then C) which, while cleanly executed, lacks structural innovation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story's major strength. The juxtaposition of a psychic research facility with mandatory waltz lessons is inspired, creating a unique and memorable atmosphere. The setting is not just a backdrop but is integral to the puzzles and the story's central theme, particularly when the dance music becomes a key to the solution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The craft is strong, with potent imagery ("cathedral of curiosity") and a clear thematic goal. However, the thematic keywords ("synthesize," "guarded disclosures") are repeated so explicitly that it verges on being heavy-handed, sacrificing some subtlety for thematic clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The originality comes from the unique combination of disparate elements rather than a truly innovative narrative. The story cleverly subverts the "holy relics" trope, but the prose, while polished, feels consciously "writerly" and meticulously constructed, missing a spark of effortless authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates masterful cohesion, weaving its many assigned elements into a tight, purposeful narrative. It succeeds admirably as an exercise in constraint. As a standalone work, its neatness and on-the-nose thematics make it feel slightly too tidy, lacking the messy ambiguity of top-tier literary fiction.</comment>
