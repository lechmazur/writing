<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The character's motivation is strong and well-connected to her 'apothecary' background, but the backstory of her exile is delivered via exposition rather than shown, a slight narrative shortcut.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a remarkable sense of a complete arc within the word limit, moving from discovery to a high-stakes climax, though the method of resolution (hull vibrations as a transmitter) requires some suspension of disbelief.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world and atmosphere are the story's greatest strength; the "battered marvel" tone is masterfully infused into every sensory detail, creating a cohesive and deeply immersive setting that enhances the narrative's tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates exceptional craft, particularly in its use of the dry highlighter as a potent symbol, but it slightly undermines its own subtlety by explicitly stating its central theme in the character's thoughts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The unique combination of steampunk, deep-sea biology, and chemical espionage feels highly original, successfully refreshing the familiar trope of a lone protagonist defying a hidden power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story feels exceptionally cohesive, with all assigned elements serving the narrative's core purpose; its brevity feels like a deliberate and impactful choice, creating a perfectly pitched, resonant vignette.</comment>
