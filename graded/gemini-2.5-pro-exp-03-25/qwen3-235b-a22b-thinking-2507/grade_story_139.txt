<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The motivation is clear, but the character feels thin. "Stubborn monk" is more of a label than a deeply integrated trait, and the internal conflict between monasticism and vengeance is asserted rather than explored, lacking genuine psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot arc is impressively complete for the word count, but its coherence relies on heavy-handed exposition. The complex mechanics (tooth marks revealing a non-corporeal nature) are told to the reader in a synopsis-like fashion, not shown, which undermines literary quality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story's greatest strength. The atmosphere is palpable, and the setting is not merely a backdrop but an active participant in the conflict—the reflective glass, the precarious height, and the critical vibrations are all used to maximum effect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The thematic core is strong, but the craft is critically flawed by its pervasive use of 'telling' over 'showing'. Crucial plot points, motivations, and concepts are explained directly, sacrificing narrative immersion and emotional resonance for the sake of clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The central conceit—defeating a shadow via frequency analysis of its bite marks—is highly original. However, the characterization is archetypal and the narrative relies on logical, almost clinical, exposition, which gives the execution a slightly artificial, calculated feel.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>A conceptually brilliant and cohesive story where all elements serve a purpose. It presents a clever, memorable idea. Its ultimate failure to reach the highest echelon is a matter of narrative technique, not concept; it reads as an elegant summary of a story, not the story itself.</comment>
