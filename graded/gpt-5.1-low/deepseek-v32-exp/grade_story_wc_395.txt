<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s core motivation is clear and specific, and her actions (opening the cold case, lying for access, preserving the data) align cleanly with it. However, interiority stays mostly at the level of articulated obsession and insight rather than moment-by-moment, embodied conflict (we don’t feel fear, guilt, or temptation in the lie, for instance). Contradictory impulses are implied (duty vs. private obsession, corporate loyalty vs. truth) but rarely dramatized in-scene. The final endurance—accepting that she will carry the “sensed absence”—is thematically apt yet emotionally under-textured for this standard.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Causality is clean: obsession → cold case → numbers → patch → hidden cluster → messages → realization of sabotage → conceptual revaluation of “deleted files.” The piece lands a valid closure via conceptual repricing, with a clear before/after in how Elara understands deletion and memory. However, several key beats (the corporate cover-up, the sabotage) arrive largely as told revelations rather than dramatized turns, which blunts impact. The investigation’s obstacles are minimal and resolved quickly, limiting structural tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The archive as a “vast, humming” environment and the image of “digital ghosts” create a consistent if somewhat generalized atmosphere, and the patch is a concrete, memorable object. Still, the setting often feels abstract and disembodied; we rarely get tactile or sensory engagement with the room, interfaces, or Elara’s body that would ground the stakes. The world’s rules (backup clusters, scrubbing frequencies) are sketched well enough to be plausible but remain schematic. The environment supports theme more than it constrains choice in specific, scene-bound ways.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering what happened to the deleted files / the lost crew—is clear, and there is one meaningful tightening when Elara lies to breach the restricted cluster. Yet the conflict is mostly investigative and conceptual; external resistance (corporate risk, technical failure, time pressure) is gestured at rather than felt. The sabotage revelation reframes stakes but doesn’t significantly narrow Elara’s options or force a painful trade-off beyond moral knowledge. As a result, tension deepens intellectually more than viscerally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The thematic core—on the ethics and cost of memory, erasure, and corporate control—is coherent and organically tied to Elara’s role and the Aethelstan tragedy. Recurring motifs (deleted files, ghosts, silence, the numbers) all point toward a meditation on unmarked graves in digital form. However, the story leans into explicit thesis statements (“She had found where the deleted files go…”) that edge into essayistic moralizing rather than letting images and scenes carry the resonance. This directness reduces ambiguity and makes the final insights feel told rather than fully earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is steady, readable, and appropriately cool for a corporate archivist, with some nice turns of phrase (“graveyard of moments,” “ashes on the wind”). POV is stable and modest—no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge—though it sometimes slides toward an essayistic register that feels more authorial than character-specific. Rhythm is generally controlled, with sentences doing conceptual work even when they verge on abstraction. The voice is competent and consistent but not yet distinctive enough for elite-level memorability.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose is clean and mostly concise, with few true redundancies and a good density of information per sentence. Some phrases and images repeat in slightly varied form (“sensed absence,” “silence,” “ghosts,” “void”), which can feel a bit circular rather than progressively intensifying. Figurative language is apt but occasionally leans toward the generic-poetic, and several key insights are stated twice in adjacent lines. Line-level craft is solid and publishable in many venues but falls short of the sharpest, most economical literary work.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The blend of a corporate social-network archivist, digital deletion as fragmented afterlife, and a sabotaged starship cold case is a fresh and appealing synthesis. The recurring-number distress code and the patch-thread as a key are strong genre inflections that feel earned rather than gimmicky. The final conceptual move—deleted files as “silence between the notes” and ethical void—is thematically rich, if a bit over-explained. Overall, the piece shows genuine ingenuity, though it stops short of the kind of formally or emotionally daring risk that would push it into the highest band.</comment>
