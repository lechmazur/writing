<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elian’s motives (reticence, kinship with Cora, desire to “bottle” safety) are clear and consistently expressed through concrete choices, especially building the guiding cairn and relighting the lamp. His interiority is particular—sea-focused, tactile—and avoids stock emotion labels. However, internal contradiction is muted: he adapts quickly from fear to solution, with little on-page struggle between competing impulses. The final quiet peace feels earned but relatively low-cost emotionally, keeping this below the very top tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: lamp fails → island dark → letters reveal threat and plea → Elian chooses cairn and relighting → haunting calms, channel protected. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and remains stable, and the drive lens reads clearly causal throughout. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Earned Stasis hybrid: the light is restored and the haunting reconfigured, with a tangible before/after in the tower’s presence. The cost is mostly conceptual and emotional rather than materially perilous, which restrains the score slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lighthouse, fog, lens, and haunted lantern room are rendered with vivid, selective detail that’s tightly filtered through a seaman’s eye. Environment constrains action (stairs, dock, shore, lamp mechanisms) and the recurring sea glass object charges the final image in a way that feels integral. Atmosphere (“luminescent ache,” “tangible sorrow for the lost light”) deepens theme without slipping into incoherence or static postcard description. Only the relative safety of the physical situation keeps it from reaching the absolute highest band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—keep the channel safe by restoring/redirecting the light—is clear early via the darkened lighthouse and Cora’s plea. Pressure escalates texturally (spectral cold intensifying, letters revealing a malevolent presence) and causally (his choice to build a guidance cairn, then face and relight the lamp). Elian’s agency drives the resolution, but his success comes without a truly sharp trade-off or visible loss, keeping the conflict emotionally quieter than the premise might allow. As a result, tension is strong but not quite piercing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of vigilance, shared duty, and the coexistence of safety and fear arise organically from particulars: the anonymous letter chain, the haunting as “old fears,” and the light that holds danger at bay while containing its ache. The final reconfiguration—accepting the luminescent ache as part of the light’s beauty—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s question about what it means to protect. Some articulation edges close to explicit statement (“not a chain of fear, but of shared vigilance”), slightly dulling ambiguity. Overall, thematic integration is confident and affecting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is steady, with a clear perceptual signature: quiet, sensory, sea-attuned, more attuned to physical texture than discursive analysis. Lyric phrases (“luminescent ache,” “cold, complex jewel”) feel consistent with the atmospheric, contemplative stance rather than imposed. There is minimal exposition and no POV leakage or head-hopping, and diction remains plausibly aligned with a taciturn but attentive seafarer. At peak beats, the narration occasionally sounds slightly more authorial than character-bound, which keeps it just shy of exceptional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong sentence-level variety and a high density of lines that do double duty for setting and emotion. Figurative language is vivid yet controlled; while the piece leans lush (“air hummed with a luminescent ache”), it largely avoids mixed metaphors or redundancy. There are few, if any, paraphrase loops or filler scaffolds, and pacing is well modulated between calm observation and charged action. Minor tendencies toward purple at times are more a stylistic risk than a true flaw, slightly restraining a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The combination of a practical lighthouse-keeping task, an anonymous letter chain, stone-cairn signaling, and a haunting made of “drowned sailors’ hopes” gives a fresh spin to a familiar maritime-ghost premise. The move to treat the haunting as fear attracted to warmth, then to incorporate its “ache” into the light’s beauty, is a nuanced, non-obvious turn. Still, the broad frame (solitary keeper restores haunted lighthouse in a stormy dawn) is well-trodden, and while elevated by specifics, it doesn’t quite achieve a fully singular conceptual leap. The story feels distinct and well-realized but not radically transformative.</comment>
