<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dynamic between the narrator and Finch is clear, specific, and affecting, with the “agreed upon lies” nicely crystallizing their relationship. The narrator’s motivation (to learn the language of buildings) is vivid but remains largely untested—there’s little contradiction or real cost to her desire. Finch’s ghostliness provides pathos and some implied regret, but he tends to function as a flawless, patient mentor rather than a fully conflicted person. The handoff of the seal is emotionally credible, yet the narrator’s internal struggle at that loss is underplayed given the weight of the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The structure is clean: inciting contact via the sugar pretext, a developing ritual of weekly teas, and a culminating rooftop scene where she questions his purpose and he passes on the seal before dissolving. Causality is coherent but relatively soft; events mostly accrue in a lyrical, reflective way rather than through strong because/therefore turns. Closure is solid as a Conceptual Repricing/RR: the mentor’s departure redefines her relationship to the city’s “language” and leaves a clear before/after. The main limitation is that the central “lesson” progresses more as explanation than as dramatized trial or change in her tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rooftop garden, night-blooming jasmine, and meteor shower are sensuously rendered and strongly tied to mood and theme, and the city-as-library metaphor feels organic to the narrator. The ghostly physicality of Finch and tactile presence of the brass seal anchor the supernatural elements in concrete detail. The setting doesn’t much constrain choices or logistics, but it does charge the final image of her alone under a fading meteor shower holding the seal. Overall, the environment is vivid, selective, and consistently filtered through the narrator’s aesthetic and intellectual obsessions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether she can learn and then carry forward this liminal “language” from a ghost who cannot stay—is clear, but it stays mostly conceptual. Escalation comes through the accumulation of lessons and their ritualization, peaking when she finally turns her interrogative impulse onto him and forces the truth of his binding and impending departure. The loss of Finch and the burden of continuing alone read as a cost, yet there’s no hard dilemma or contested choice where she must sacrifice something tangible for this knowledge. The conflict remains quiet and internal, effective for a lyric piece but not fully maximized for narrative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of translation between worlds, the constructedness of truth, and the shared languages of living and dead are integrated through the recurring motifs of buildings speaking, the seal, and the “agreed upon lie.” The final line—about languages only spoken between living and dead in the spaces we build—beautifully reweights all prior imagery and clarifies what’s truly at stake. There is some explicit thematic articulation in dialogue (“The final lesson…”) that edges toward telling rather than pure emergence but remains within tone. The piece invites reflection on mentorship, haunting, and how we inherit structures (physical and emotional) without collapsing into a neat moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that loves metaphor and conceptual framing (“the city was my library, but I was illiterate”). Finch’s dialogue is distinct enough—measured, faintly archaic—without breaking the established register. The piece manages a sustained elevated diction without drifting into academic abstraction or breaking POV plausibility. Psychic distance is well controlled, staying close enough to her perceptions while allowing some reflective commentary suitable to the retrospective, ghostly tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is polished and musical, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme, and sentence rhythms varying enough to avoid monotony. Extended metaphors (city as library, bones and veins of buildings) are coherent and not over-stacked to the point of confusion. There is some density of figurative language that occasionally risks purple, but it doesn’t materially obscure sense or closure. Information is efficiently compressed for backstory (the sugar pretext, the weekly teas) without sacrificing momentum in this lyric mode.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The combination of a ghost tutor, architectural linguistics, and the brass seal as a translation tool feels fresh and specific, rather than a generic ghost story frame. The “agreed upon lie” motif gives the relationship and the metaphysics of the world a distinctive twist. The ending’s reframing—this being a language only spoken between the living and the dead in shared spaces—delivers a non-obvious yet inevitable-feeling insight. While the structure itself is conventional (mentorship leading to inheritance), the particular imaginative lens (buildings as speakers, seals as translators) is genuinely memorable.</comment>
