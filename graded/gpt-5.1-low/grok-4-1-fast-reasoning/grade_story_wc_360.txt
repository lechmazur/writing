<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias is sharply drawn—a fusion of fanatic curiosity and eerie detachment—whose borrowing of Mira’s personality creates a credible, costly misfire. His motivation (“the mathematics of emotion”) is consistent and drives concrete choices with embodied fallout (staggering under her terror). Mira is more schematic but still has a clear arc from terror to obsessive understanding and back. Internal contradiction is present but could deepen: Elias reaches insight and equilibrium very quickly for someone just drowned in cosmic dread.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The causal spine is clear: Elias primes the press → Mira arrives with fear → the ambiguous broadsheet triggers transposed empathy → feedback loop forces a frantic recalibration → partial mastery and a quiet new equilibrium. The story holds to one continuous scene with a legible before/after and a conceptual price (they’ve both been altered by the experiment; the fragment is spent). Closure lands via a conceptual repricing of “emotion as equation” and of the halo’s power, with stakes paid in psychic disruption rather than external consequence. Some beats feel a touch schematic (the math realization arrives in declarative sentences) which slightly blunts the sense of hard-earned resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The topaz workshop, halo fragment, and vanishing stars produce a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels integral rather than decorative. The topaz walls, celestial inks, and press mechanics are filtered through Elias’s sensibility and directly shape action (halo in the platen; star-dust ink; the workshop as emotional lab). The vanishing stars function as both visual motif and soft clock, tightening the climax around the “penultimate star.” Environment and object charge the final image (dimmed halo, new star), satisfying the “setting as constraint/charge” test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Elias can use transposed empathy to “quantify” emotion without losing control—is signaled early and escalates cleanly once the broadsheet is read. The key tightening comes when the transpose overwhelms them, turning his tactic (disorientation) back on him and forcing him into frenzied printing and a risky grab of the fragment. The cost is primarily internal and conceptual (psychic inundation, fragment drained), which fits the mode but feels slightly under-felt on the page; their recovery is swift and tidy. No major reversals are missing, but a sharper sense of what might be irrevocably lost would intensify the pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The piece builds a coherent thematic web around empathy, ambiguity, and the urge to turn feeling into math, with the halo and press as strong motifs. The idea that “transposed empathy was the ultimate equation” is dramatized through the failed/successful experiment, not just asserted. However, the theme is occasionally over-articulated in near-thesis lines (“Emotion was not mere sum but infinite series”), tipping from resonance into commentary. The ending does offer a reweighted view—truth between vanishings, a new star as emotional rebirth—though it edges toward neatness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confidently lyrical with a distinct texture—dense imagery, mathematical-astral diction—that feels unified with Elias’s mind. POV remains stable and primarily close-third on Elias, with Mira’s shifts indicated through action and dialogue rather than head-hopping. Dialogue is spare but effective, carrying subtext (his use of her own voice, her wild laughter when overtaken by his drive). At times the elevated register risks uniformity across speakers, but the overall control and consistency under pressure hold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The line-level craft is rich and mostly controlled, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“joy equaled sorrow’s derivative” neatly encodes both world and obsession). Rhythm varies enough to keep the dense imagery from congealing, and action remains clear even in peak beats. That said, there is some purple stacking and conceptual repetition (vanishings, equations, turbulence) that could be trimmed for even sharper momentum. The declarative exposition of the final insight slightly undercuts the otherwise vivid, image-driven texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of letterpress craft, celestial mechanics, and “transposed empathy” as a quasi-mathematical system feels genuinely fresh. The halo-in-the-platen device, personality-borrowing as a working method, and the vanishing-stars clock create a distinctive speculative-literary hybrid. The climax’s feedback loop—his method turning viciously back on him—is an elegant, character-driven twist that reconfigures the premise rather than relying on a cheap reveal. A bit more mess or moral ambiguity in the aftermath could push it higher, but as is it reads as an original, confident vision.</comment>
