<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias and Lila are both clearly motivated—his persistence and fear of irrelevance, her skepticism and pride—and their relationship shift is credible within the compressed length. Interiority is mostly summarized rather than deeply embodied, but key objects (the ribbon, the bag, the heart-tree) reveal them under pressure. Lila’s turn from scoffing to softening lands, though it edges on quick and tidy emotionally. The relationship does change in a felt way by the end, with a visible cost in vulnerability and concession on both sides.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: the long-ago breach → wild orchard and failing visions → Elias’s ongoing tending → discovery of the bag → joint repair of the heart-tree’s eye → relational and world-level restoration. Closure is a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration, as Lila reframes the vows and commits to future practice with her father. The coincidence of Lila arriving just after the bag’s discovery is somewhat convenient but not implausible in a mythic frame. Structure (single scene with integrated backstory) is tight and legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The orchard-in-the-rafters cathedral is vivid, specific, and consistently used: ropes, beams, sap-dripping fruit, and the storm-battered roof all shape movement and danger. The environment directly constrains action (climbing, almost-falls, falling beam) and charges the heart-tree apex and final fruit-glow image. World rules around quartz eyes and vows are shown rather than over-explained, maintaining a coherent, lived-in fantastical space. The setting’s organic imagery mirrors the relational regrowth without feeling purely ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mending the breached relationship and, through it, the failing seer-craft—is clear early via the “breach of contract/deciduous vows” frame. Pressure escalates from quiet tending to the stormy, dangerous climb and the urgent need to repair the heart-tree as visions across the valleys dim. The physical jeopardy (falling beam, rotted beams) and emotional risk (admitting fear, reconsidering “superstitions”) interlock, though the world-spanning stakes remain mostly abstract talk rather than dramatized. The resolution feels earned but slightly low in perceived cost, leaning toward harmonious reconciliation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of tradition vs autonomy, generational transmission of craft, and the cyclical nature of vows are strongly woven through the orchard, deciduous imagery, and the heart-tree repair. The final realization that vows are “roots that regrow” effectively reweights prior images and actions, but it is stated a bit too directly, edging into thesis-sentence territory. Subtext exists—the orchard’s overgrowth as unbound promises, Elias’s fear of irrelevance under his persistence—but often gets surfaced explicitly rather than trusted to image. The emotional aftereffect is warm and reflective, if somewhat tidy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, slightly elevated and lyrical but not incoherent, with a clear perceptual bias toward craft, stone, and growth. Diction and rhythm are controlled; sentences carry a textured cadence that suits the quasi-mythic setting. Dialogue is generally natural and purposeful, with Lila’s sharper, skeptical tone contrasted against Elias’s gentler persistence, though a few lines carry more exposition than subtext. Psychic distance remains stable and appropriate, avoiding head-hopping or unexplained omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose is lush and image-rich, with good sentence-level variety and a high density of meaningful detail; most lines do at least two jobs. A few phrases verge on repetition (“feisty,” “breach,” “persist”) and there are moments bordering on purple, but clarity and momentum are maintained. Figurative language is largely coherent and grounded in the story’s imagery (roots, leaves, light), avoiding mixed metaphors. There is minimal scaffolding or synonym churn, and the final image lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of an abandoned cathedral orchard, quartz seer-eyes, and “deciduous vows” as a familial craft is genuinely fresh. While the reconciliation arc is familiar, the way it’s embodied—through mending a literal heart-tree eye with bag-found relics—is inventive and specific. The story commits to its eccentric worldbuilding rather than treating it as mere garnish, and the orchard’s overgrowth as consequence of unrenewed vows is a strong conceptual touch. Some emotional beats follow recognizable patterns, but the world and method of resolution feel memorably singular.</comment>
