<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elowen’s core motivation—to give voice to unspoken needs—is clear and organically linked to her history as a seldom-heard balladeer. Her choices (climbing to the courtyard, engaging with the ghost, using the plate) all align cleanly with this drive. However, she experiences little real resistance or internal contradiction; the path from recognition to solution is mostly frictionless. The lack of a visible cost or hard choice at the end keeps the characterization from feeling fully tested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The structure is clean: arrival, discovery of the living graffiti, encounter with the ghost, retrieval and use of the plate, and release of the ghost in a single continuous scene. Causality is solid and legible under a mostly causal-with-lyric-accumulation lens (“because she can hear the ghost, she acts; because she acts with the plate, the ghost is freed”). Closure is on-page and coherent—the ghost’s liberation and the thunder-as-voices provide a resonant before/after. The main limitation is that the resolution feels too smooth, with no serious complication or cost impinging on the protagonist’s plan.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The “misty courtyard above the clouds,” floating balustrades, and graffiti-vines are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elowen’s sensibility. The environment and tools (courtyard walls, cloud-moss pigments, the plate) are used in action rather than as mere backdrop, and the storm’s suspended moment nicely matches the poised emotional state. World rules (cloud realm, ghost-in-graffiti, tinkering) feel internally consistent at this length. The setting mostly shapes mood and available tools rather than constraining choices, which keeps it just shy of the very top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the ghost’s encoded pleas can be fully articulated and freed—is clear, and Elowen’s desire is aligned with it. There is one main tightening as she finds and uses the flower press bolt plate to merge code and graffiti. However, there is no meaningful opposition: neither the world nor Elowen herself significantly resists the goal, and everything required appears exactly when needed. As a result, escalation is more procedural than pressurized, and the final success carries little sense of risk or trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of silenced voices, encoded yearning, and the transformation of private pain into public song are well-woven through the ghost’s backstory and Elowen’s vocation. The recurring emphasis on “unspoken needs” and seldom-heard songs gives the ending—thunder as collective articulation—genuine resonance. Some lines edge toward on-the-nose slogan (“Let us speak the unsaid; let thunder carry our truths”), which slightly flattens complexity. Still, the piece earns a reflective after-effect without collapsing into overt moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The third-person close voice is stable, with a distinct lyrical texture (“tinkersong wonder,” “driftingly alert”) that suits the fable-like mode. Diction and rhythm are controlled and mostly consistent; invented terms and metaphors feel of a piece with the world. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the ghost’s “voice” is handled cleverly through visual reformation rather than clunky dialogue. Repetition of certain coined phrases edges toward mannerism but doesn’t yet break the spell.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The line-level work is generally strong: images are concrete, sentences vary in rhythm, and most lines do multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and action at once). The prose occasionally veers toward purple with stacked modifiers and repeated special-words, but semantics remain clear and momentum doesn’t stall. There’s little scaffolding or redundancy; the piece maintains forward motion despite its lyric density. A slight trim of adjectival load in a few sentences would elevate this to elite polish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The fusion of cloud-courtyard, graffiti as encoded pleas, a “ghost in code” scribe, and a Victorian flower press bolt plate as decoding mechanism is genuinely fresh. The story commits to its idiosyncratic “tinkersong” aesthetic instead of retreating to generic fantasy, and the central image of needs becoming thunder feels non-obvious yet fitting. While the emotional arc (giving voice to the voiceless) is familiar, the execution through these specific fantastical mechanics is distinctive. Some risk is mitigated by a too-easy resolution, but the conceptual synthesis is memorable.</comment>
