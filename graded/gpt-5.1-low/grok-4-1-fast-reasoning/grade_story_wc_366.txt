<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elias and Harlan are clearly individuated, with Elias’s reticence and quiet care paying off in his decision to write a note and “protect” the chain. Motivation—seeking or offering safety in a hostile environment—is coherent and specific to both men. Emotional embodiment is mostly via physical detail and action rather than labels. Internal contradiction in Elias (leaving vs. protecting) is present but only lightly dramatized, keeping this short of the top tier.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The causal spine—lamp failure → climb to lantern room → discovery of stone-code letters → Elias’s vow/note → departure at dawn—is sound and closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise. However, the text breaks into visible drafting notes (“No—that exceeded; trim in mind…” etc.), which fracture temporal continuity and undercut the ending’s clarity. The brief contradictory beats about helping Harlan vs. descending alone add to the sense of an unclean final pass. Structure is basically there but not yet publishable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lighthouse, storm, jagged cliffs, and especially the haunted lantern room and stone stacks are vivid, specific, and filtered through Elias’s professional familiarity. Environmental elements (storm, darkness, high room, stacked stones, sea glass) meaningfully charge the emotional stakes and the final image. The atmosphere sustains a coherent, salt-slick, ghost-haunted mood that feels lived-in rather than touristic. Setting could constrain action a bit more directly, but it already does strong thematic and tonal work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stakes—whether the “bottled” safety of the light and letters will persist as Harlan fails and the lamp goes out—are clear, and there is one solid tightening when Elias discovers the anonymous chain and chooses to contribute to it. External pressures (storm, haunt, Harlan’s worsening cough) remain mostly atmospheric rather than forcing hard trade-offs. The final choice to “protect” the chain has conceptual cost but feels relatively low-pressure on the page, with escalation more textural than sharply dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of safety as something fragile, transmissible, and “bottled” through notes, light, and sea glass is integrated across objects and actions, not tacked on. The anonymous letter chain reframes the haunted room as a site of accumulated care, and Elias’s final contribution subtly answers the question of how safety survives when the literal light fails. There are a few explicit statements of the theme (“to bottle the feeling of safety”) that edge toward on-the-nose but don’t collapse into moralizing. The resonance is genuine and lingers, though more complexity in the cost of this safety would deepen it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is largely consistent—lyric, sensory, and close to Elias—with dialogue that feels apt for the setting and characters. The perceptual filter (reticent, observant skipper) is mostly stable. However, the mid-to-late intrusion of raw drafting commentary (“No—that exceeded; trim in mind…”) abruptly breaks POV, stance, and rhythm, reading as unintentional artifact. This rupture disqualifies the piece from higher-band voice scores despite its underlying strengths.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Much of the line-level writing is strong: vivid verbs, concrete images, and generally efficient sentences that braid mood and action. There is some drift toward purple (“luminescent ache,” “abyssal black”) but it mostly remains controlled. The major issue is the presence of obvious process scaffolding and contradictory fragments in the final third, which wreck immersion and cadence at the point where precision matters most. Those artifacts must be removed and the ending re-smoothed before the prose can meet elite-publication standards.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The combination of a haunted lighthouse, coded stone stacks, an anonymous letter chain about safety, and a reticent supply skipper is a fresh, non-template synthesis. The idea of “bottling” safety through recurring, hidden notes and sea glass is particularly distinctive. While some gothic elements are familiar, their integration feels personal rather than generic. Stronger escalation and a cleaner formal execution would lift the ingenuity further.</comment>
