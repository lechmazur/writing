<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and specific—the narrator’s mix of corporate cynicism and quasi-religious awe over the archive feels individual rather than generic. Their obsession with Ora and 713 is well-motivated and consistent with their role. However, contradictory impulses (fear vs compulsion, loyalty vs betrayal) are more implied than dramatized in live, pressured choices, so the final decision to query Deep Cold lands more as inevitability than hard-won, costly turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal chain is clear: disappearance → anomaly (713) → suppressed bug report → pattern-trace → spoofed audit → forbidden query → discovery of where deletions go. The piece works primarily on an accumulative/textural lens but still honors causality enough that the closure (conceptual repricing of “deleted”) feels earned. Cost and future consequence of the discovery are mostly implied instead of put under direct pressure, which keeps the structural arc just shy of fully decisive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The “humming cathedral of obsolete lives,” chilled racks, Deep Cold, and the playlist/silence mechanics create a richly specific, non-generic tech-environment filtered through the narrator’s sensibility. The archive is not backdrop; its rules (backups, deletion routing, warrant gates, pattern-loving system) constrain tactics and make the final realization possible. The spaceship patch functions as a micro-setting object that charges the decision scene nicely, further deepening atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the truth about where deleted files and possibly disappearing employees go—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates somewhat as 713 spreads, the company stamps RESOLVED, and the narrator chooses to lie and pierce Deep Cold. Still, most of this escalation is retrospective rather than dramatized in live, contested beats, and concrete costs (risk of job, legal danger, Ora’s possible complicity) never quite sharpen into a forced trade-off on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of memory vs erasure, corporate control vs humane design, and escape-as-“deletion” emerge organically from particulars: the choir/jingles metaphor, Deep Cold, RESOLVED as a lie, the memorial garden, and the patch’s crashed/escaped mission subtext. The recurring 713 and the silences at 7:01:03 beautifully embody the idea of absence as active, chosen space. The ending’s conceptual twist—that deleted profiles continue in an adless, quiet subnet for those who choose to stay—reweights the whole piece without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The first-person voice is confident, textured, and internally consistent, balancing technical lexicon with lyric metaphor (“choir forced to sing commercial jingles,” “stone in my shoe”). The narrator’s perceptual bias—seeing systems as choirs, scripts as lies, silence as content—feels distinct and drives phrasing. There’s no head-hopping or stance wobble, and the modulation from wry to quietly awed at the end is smooth and earned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, emotion) with little redundancy; rhythm varies, and images are mostly precise and non-generic. Metaphors extend coherently (music, choirs, silence, echoes) rather than stacking randomly, and corporate jargon is sparingly, aptly used. There’s mild density in a few consecutive metaphors, but it doesn’t blur clarity or momentum, keeping the prose in high-tier territory.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The core premise—corporate archivist treating “deleted” social data as a missing-persons cold case, with anomalies in the system as the haunting—is fresh and thoughtfully executed. Recurring numbers as a haunting mechanism, silence-as-content, and a secret adless afterlife subnet for profiles give a distinctive spin on digital ghosts. The spaceship patch and the notion of crashes as escapes add a non-obvious, yet thematically integrated, layer rather than feeling like prompt dressing.</comment>
