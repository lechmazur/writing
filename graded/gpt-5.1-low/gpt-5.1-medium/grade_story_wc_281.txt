<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Eli and Naya both feel specific and legible, with Eli’s burdened hyper-awareness and Naya’s “affectionate skeptic” stance shaping every exchange. Eli’s motivation—to stop being chewed up by other people’s echoes while honoring his ethics—is clear and consistent. The micro-choice to “treat this like a design problem” is a credible turn that fits his temperament. Internal contradiction (resenting the power yet using it to help) is present but could be pushed slightly harder for a more visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal spine is clean: shock → lingering ability → joint attempt to aim it → partial success and reframing as tool. Structure holds as a single scene with one interior excursion, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where Eli accepts an ongoing constraint and a new way to work with it. Cost (he still carries the echoes; nothing is “fixed”) is present but understated. The piece leans slightly toward accumulative/lyric in the middle, yet the drive lens remains coherent enough not to damage closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The light painting studio, fiber brushes, projector glow, and geode all create a tactile, atmospheric micro-setting that syncs with the story’s concern with paths of light and mental mapping. Details are filtered through Eli’s state (the room “falls away” into remembered light paths; breath clouds in faint beams), avoiding white-room syndrome. The recurring geode and light-painting imagery charge the final “compass” idea meaningfully. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain action, but it does subtly frame what choices feel available.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Eli will be consumed by unwanted telepathic residues or find a way to ethically channel them—is clear and pursued. Pressure escalates when he enters the web of audience feelings and locates the “knot” of shared hurt, moving from abstract burden to a concrete test of agency. The decision to redirect that knot and accept that he may also affect others is an earned, if quiet, turn. The risk and downside of failure are more conceptual than visceral, which keeps the stakes emotionally a notch lower than they could be.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from action: the ethics of perception, art as guidance versus intrusion, and transforming an unwanted sensitivity into a tool that returns light rather than hoarding or absorbing it. The pill, geode, and performance all embody questions about consent and pattern recognition without overt moralizing. The line “You don’t have to carry every echo; you can devise patterns that return the light” nicely crystallizes the thematic pivot without feeling like a sermon. Complexity is present in that Eli’s power remains morally ambiguous even as it becomes more useful.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The close third-person voice has a strong, consistent texture—lyric but not opaque—and clearly belongs to Eli, with Naya’s spoken lines carrying their own idiom. Telepathic overlap (“Naya murmured inside the vision”) is handled cleanly and feels integrated rather than like head-hopping. Dialogue is natural, purposeful, and subtextual, revealing both care and skepticism without expository dumping. Rhythm modulates well between dense interiority and leaner exchanges, maintaining control of distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is high: vivid metaphors (“cobwebs of possible choices,” “willowglass hope”) usually land cleanly and are meaningfully tethered to the story’s motifs. Sentences carry multiple jobs—worldbuilding, emotion, and momentum—without obvious scaffolding or repetition. The prose occasionally approaches lushness, but the pattern is consistent and legible, not purple or confusing. There are no noticeable loops, syntax glitches, or figurative muddles that sap the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The combination of a telepathy pill, somatic-marker-based “reading,” a light-painting performance that mapped audience minds, and a muscovite geode as a psychic compass feels fresh and internally coherent. The pivot from “cursed souvenir” to design problem and tool is an elegant non-obvious turn that fits both characters. Emotional stakes—art as intervention in unseen mental pathways—give the speculative apparatus real weight. It stops short of radical formal experimentation, but as a concept-and-character synthesis it’s distinctive and memorable.</comment>
