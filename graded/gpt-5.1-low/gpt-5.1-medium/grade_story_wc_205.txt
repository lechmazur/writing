<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara is sharply drawn as a once-radical now trying to rebel on a different plane; her shift from defensive mirror-covering to protective preservation of imagined futures feels earned and particular. Her past as a leader and present as someone the Council deems “defunct” coheres with her motives and micro-choices throughout. Elyas is sketched more lightly but distinctly, his curiosity and idealism making sense of his risks. The only limit at this length is that we glimpse, rather than fully inhabit, Mara’s contradictions under direct interpersonal pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The accumulative structure is clean: shard → hypothesis about the Hourglass → excavation of sealed chambers → interpretive dispute → institutional shutdown → counter-narrative via poems and mirrors → reconfigured final stance. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: Mara accepts that official history won’t change but commits to preserving alternate futures, with emotional and institutional cost implicit. Causality is consistent and each move grows logically from the last without outline-y “and then” sequencing. The only ceiling is that external consequences (e.g., concrete risk from defying the Council) remain mostly implied rather than dramatized in-scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid, visible time, mirrors, and crystal coils are vividly specific and deeply integrated into action and theme—this never reads like a postcard tour. Environmental rules (time curtains, mirrors as leverage, coils in shards) stay consistent and materially shape choices from Mara’s initial mirror-covering to the final storm walk. The final image of the asteroid as “a theater… of unused possibility” recharges the entire setting with conceptual weight. At this scale it’s hard to see what more the piece could do with place without crowding out character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—what kind of story will be told about this civilization, and whether alternate futures can survive institutional suppression—is clear and tight. Pressure escalates as the archaeological find threatens the Council’s myth, provoking an official shutdown that forces Mara and Elyas into clandestine resistance via poems and projections. Mara’s final choice to keep covering mirrors, now to protect imagined futures, is an earned stance that forecloses simple return to either her old revolution or passive compliance. The conflict remains largely intellectual and institutional rather than viscerally risky on the page, which keeps it just short of the highest band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from objects and actions: history as constructed theater, time as both mausoleum and rehearsal space, revolution as an imaginative rather than purely martial act. The funerary-vs-rehearsal dispute is a strong thematic engine, and the final image reframes the asteroid from fortress/tomb into a precarious stage of “unused possibility” without didactic moralizing. Mara’s internal arc—from warding off time to guarding alternative futures—embodies the story’s questions about how we relate to past and potential. A touch more dramatized friction over the personal costs of this new rebellion could deepen the resonance further.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is lyrically controlled yet precise, with a consistent perceptual signature that feels close to Mara while still allowing a slightly widened, fable-like vantage. Syntax and rhythm are varied and deliberate, and figurative language generally serves both mood and world-building rather than decoration. Elyas’s “poetically inclined” nature is reflected in what he notices and proposes, differentiating him without overt exposition. The only minor limit is that the voice leans more toward an elegant impersonal narrator than fully idiosyncratic free indirect interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is very strong: high information density, clean syntax, and images like “time thickened around her fingertips, swirling in pale bands suspended like smoke in syrup” that are rich but still legible. There is no noticeable scaffolding, repetition, or template cadence, and the rhythm supports the accumulative, reverent tone. The prose does push toward lushness in nearly every sentence, which risks saturation but mostly avoids genuine purple or muddled metaphor. A bit more sparseness at one or two pressure points could sharpen contrast and impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The core conceit—visible time as a manipulable substance in a baroque asteroid-archive, with political stakes hinging on archaeological interpretation—is striking and feels genuinely fresh. Familiar motifs (revolution, suppressed history, councils) are reconfigured through highly specific, inventive imagery (time coils, Founders’ Hourglass, saints of entropy). The turn from war-fortress myth to ceremonial mausoleum/theater of possibilities is both surprising and inevitable in retrospect. This is the kind of speculative-literary synthesis that could stand out in elite venues, held back only slightly by its relatively gentle external conflict.</comment>
