<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kerran’s motivation—to keep organizing for others even after death—is clear, specific, and carried consistently from petitions in life to chalk routes in death. Interiority is brief but sharp (“that sentence loosened something I had tightened around my own memory of drowning in hospital light”), giving a felt contradiction between past despair and present usefulness. Micro-choices under pressure (what to write, when to urge them to move now, what to prioritize) reveal a value hierarchy without speechifying. The main limitation is that Kerran’s internal conflict stays relatively subtle; we see more competence and purpose than real struggle with doubt or selfish impulse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: quakes → messages under the bell → organized preparation → nebula formation and intensified danger → last-minute adaptation and crossing → partial survival with cost. The drive lens reads as primarily Causal with a situational backdrop (planetary decay and nebula legend) that consistently pressures tactics. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the community stands on a surviving span, transformed from strangers to family, with a clear before/after marked by saved orchards and the bell in shards. If anything, the transition from “legend” of the nebula to its concrete behavior is a touch brisk, but it doesn’t undercut coherence or cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The orchard planet and floating arches are vividly and economically rendered, with details like “iron-black loop cradling an old butterfly garden” and “violet river curling into itself” doing double duty for atmosphere and world rules. Setting meaningfully constrains choices: arches can collapse, ladders and cranes must span them, and the nebula alters gravity, all of which shape the evacuation plan. The watering bell and arches recur as charged objects/structures, culminating in the cracked bell and surviving span at the end. The only reason this doesn’t push into the 9s is that environmental constraint, while strong, isn’t exploited for complex tactical variation beyond the main crossing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stakes (preserving orchards/homes and lives) are clear early, with the looming loss of the northern orchards providing coherent pressure. Escalation is well-managed: slow-building quakes and preparations, then the sudden formation of the nebula and arch collapses that force rapid revision of plans (“They reexamined every plan in minutes”). Kerran’s agency via planning and urgent messaging drives the community’s survival, and there is a concrete price—lost arches, cracked bell, abandoned heirlooms, and palpable exhaustion. The main limitation is that moral or interpersonal dilemmas remain relatively light; conflict is more logistical and existential than ethically fraught.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of collective action, mutual trust between living and dead, and the persistence of care in a failing world emerge organically from events, especially the line “Sound travels kindly for those who died trying to help.” The bell, arches, and nebula create a layered sense of fragile respite and the cost of survival, culminating in “a brambled hope sturdy enough to share the weight of a changing sky,” which reweights everything before. There’s no overt moralizing; the story suggests that failed campaigns can bear fruit elsewhere and that community is literally what holds in a collapsing system. A touch more dramatized ambivalence or complication around dependence on legends/the nebula could deepen the thematic ambiguity further.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The first-person ghost POV is controlled, with a distinctive, slightly wry and lyrical voice that remains consistent even under stress. Diction choices (“an altruistic ghost who had never stopped organizing,” “gas flared… becoming a luminous bruise”) feel both character-specific and tonally apt. Distance is well-managed: we get enough reflection to understand Kerran’s history without stalling the present-tense urgency of planning and evacuation. There are no POV slips or explanatory intrusions; the only small limit is that the voice sometimes prioritizes beauty over raw immediacy, which may slightly smooth the edge of the crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, with dense but generally precise imagery that rarely feels excessive. Phrases like “floating rock arches that drifted like reefs” and “empty ladders into the violet updraft like discarded vertebrae” are vivid and functional, deepening both mood and world. There’s minimal redundancy, no obvious scaffolding, and the prose maintains momentum even while being poetic. A few beats could arguably bear one fewer metaphor for even cleaner impact at peak pressure, but clarity and propulsion remain intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of an “orchard planet,” altruistic ghost-organizer, nebula of respite, and chalk logistics under a cracked bell feels genuinely fresh rather than assembled from familiar genre templates. The use of civic organizing and protest-culture echoes in a far-future disaster scenario (“old protest songs,” petitions turned to soul-routing) gives the piece particularity and emotional bite. The final image of unseen ghost-smile intertwined with communal gratitude and grief under a changing sky is memorable and non-obvious. It stops just short of the rarefied 9+ because the core arc (community bands together during planetary disaster) is familiar, though here executed with unusual specificity and elegance.</comment>
