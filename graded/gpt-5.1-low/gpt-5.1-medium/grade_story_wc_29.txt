<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motivations are specific and consistent—she’s driven by curiosity, resistance to institutional power, and a wary fascination with the Void. Interiority is vivid (“she did not feel like prey or pawn but like a gambler setting the table”), and her final stance feels earned. The shift from passive listener to active interlocutor tracks cleanly through micro-choices (killing the playlist, retuning, patching in sub-bass). Internal contradiction is present but could be sharpened further; her fear of the tricksters rarely threatens to stop her.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The structure is cleanly accumulative: station politics and Void behavior layer toward Mara’s decision to “interfere” and the Void’s answer. Causality is coherent—admin decision → campus unrest → altered signal → Mara’s tactical response—under a Hybrid causal/accumulative lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the final swell confirms contact and reweights earlier “game” language with real stakes. The cost is mostly conceptual (ceding attention and leverage to tricksters) rather than concretely dramatized, which keeps this just shy of the very top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The university radio station and tower are richly realized through tactile and auditory detail—“the building’s nervous hum,” “guy-wires thrummed…in her teeth,” ceiling dust, exit light on charts. Setting constrains choice: access to the Void band, sub-bass equipment, and the tower sale itself all arise from this specific environment. The final image of the Void rattling window glass ties environment directly into closure. A minor limitation is that the broader campus/defense world stays mostly conceptual rather than spatially or socially textured on the page.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The central stake—who controls the tower and thus the Void—is clear and steadily pressured via admin plans, senate opposition, and the live debate overhead. Escalation comes from Mara’s choice to exploit the conflict as bait, adding a moral/strategic dimension rather than just observing. Her agency at the peak is undeniable, but the immediate cost of this interference is more implied than felt. The conflict tilts cerebral rather than visceral, which slightly mutes tension at the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of power, consent, and who gets to play with dangerous tools emerge organically from institutional politics and Mara’s gambit with the tricksters. “Pranks that turned cruel when nobody laughed anymore” and the contrast between students and generals crystallize the ethical line without sliding into sermonizing. The ending’s “frequencies laced with stubborn hope” offers a resonant, non-literal response to the thematic question of how to resist fear-driven bargains. A touch more on-page friction—e.g., showing internal doubt about risking the community—could deepen the thematic cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent and distinctive, blending technical radio language with cosmic metaphor (“the sky thinking aloud,” “tuning fork jammed into the clouds”). The perceptual signature feels uniquely Mara’s, attuned to hums, buzzes, and signal patterns; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Rhythm and diction modulate well with pressure, tightening around the interference sequence. A couple of lines edge toward overt thesis (“power play written in radio ink”), but they still feel voice-motivated rather than authorial intrusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is notably strong: sentences are varied, dense, and often do double duty with image and information. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent, staying in the aural/electrical/cosmic lexicon without mixing metaphors. There’s no evident scaffold, repetition loops, or clarity breaks; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. The prose is lush enough that in a longer piece it might risk over-saturation, but at this length it maintains momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of campus governance drama, DIY radio culture, and quasi-mythic “cosmic tricksters” feels fresh and specific. Using subsonic pledge-drive rhetoric as a kind of incantation to bait extraterrestrial mischief is an inventive tactical and thematic twist. The piece commits to its weirdness without coyness, and the final swell makes the speculative element feel earned rather than gimmicky. It stops short of radically subverting form or expectation, but within its scope it’s memorably original.</comment>
