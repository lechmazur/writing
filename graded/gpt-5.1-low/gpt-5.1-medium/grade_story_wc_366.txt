<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias is sharply etched through restrained but specific interiority: his reticence, practical skepticism, and habitual noticing all feed directly into his choices (rearranging stones, lingering over the letters, deciding to write his own). The contradiction between “not believing in ghosts” and still altering the spiral and trembling at the door plays well. His final decision to step into a quasi-keeper/protector role feels earned from his history of unnoticed service. The only limitation is that his flaw set (reticence, modesty) is gestured at more than directly tested in on-page confrontation with other people.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The piece uses a tight, accumulative single-scene structure: arrival → discovery of stones → discovery of letters → internalized question of protection → act of writing and minor ritual with the sea glass. Causality is clean and legible; each discovery meaningfully deepens the central question of “who will protect us now” rather than feeling like a list. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he moves from transient deliveryman to self-appointed part of an ongoing protective chain, with cost in the implied ongoing responsibility. Stakes are modest but coherent for the form and length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse, dark sea, iron steps, and lantern room are rendered with vivid, selective detail that always passes through Elias’s professional eye. Environment constrains action and mood: isolation, darkness, and the now-useless machinery frame his decision to create a tiny substitute light. Recurring objects (stones, lens, sea glass) are rooted in place and charge the final image of the small green halo. The only minor gap is that the “haunted” aspect remains more tonal than concretely pressuring his choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The conflict is primarily internal and ethical: whether anyone will, or can, take on the lighthouse’s protective role after institutional abandonment. Tension escalates through the letters’ content—from thanks, to fear, to plea for guidance—until he can no longer remain a purely logistical shadow. His decisive act (offering to read the stones and answer) forecloses the prior, safer posture of detachment and implies an ongoing burden of care. The stakes remain small-scale and quiet, which suits the story, though a slightly sharper sense of what this commitment might cost him practically could intensify the pressure further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of unseen labor, mutual care versus institutional neglect, and anonymous gratitude are woven through concrete particulars—the defunded lamp, the stone code once used for wrecking, the letter chain of thanks and fear. The story avoids sermonizing; instead, the anonymous letters and Elias’s unsung role invite reflection on who “protects” communities when official structures fail. The final image of a tiny, inadequate but intentional green glow paired with his promise to “keep each other” offers a resonant answer without tidy moral. Complexity remains: his gesture is moving yet clearly insufficient to truly replace the light.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, textured, and character-specific, with lines like “steering his stub-nosed boat like an apology” clearly filtered through Elias’s sensibility. Diction balances lyricism and concreteness without drifting into implausible register for a seasoned skipper. There is confident modulation: descriptive and reflective passages lengthen where appropriate, then tighten for key choices. It’s strong literary voice work, if not quite at the once-in-a-decade level of distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentence-level craft is precise and economical; most lines carry multiple functions (setting, mood, and character) without padding. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and grounded in the sea/lighthouse domain, avoiding mixed metaphors or muddle. Rhythm varies naturally across the piece, and there’s no obvious scaffold, repetition loop, or filter-verb stack dulling immediacy. A few phrases nudge toward the lush (“luminescent ache”), but they are sparse and supported by context rather than feeling ornamental.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The combination of a decommissioned lighthouse in the era of navigation apps, an old stone code, and an anonymous gratitude chain addressed to unseen keepers feels fresh and thoughtfully synthesized. Centering the supply skipper rather than the keeper as protagonist gives the premise a distinctive angle on peripheral caretakers. The final reweighting—from institutional light to fragile, shared vigilance—is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. While it doesn’t radically reinvent form or genre, it stands out as a refined, original variation on maritime/haunting motifs.</comment>
