<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator’s desire to “learn the language of old buildings” is clear and consistent, and the sugar lie nicely exposes their reluctance to admit deeper motives. The tutor is a vivid presence with a distinct manner and a quietly authoritative status, but we don’t see him under much pressure or contradiction. Interiority is particular and embodied (taste of air, etiquette in the spine) rather than generic, which keeps the protagonist specific. The closing realization about carrying buildings’ denials feels earned, though the personal cost could be shaded more sharply.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The structure is cleanly accumulative: first trespass → relationship ritualized into weekly meetings → meteor-shower ritual that finally lets the building speak. The global drive lens is textural rather than causal, but the movement toward the rooftop ceremony and the seal’s activation provides a clear tightening and closure. The final beat is a conceptual repricing: learning the language of buildings is redefined as inheriting their denials, with the seal changing hands. Causality holds and there’s no orientation debt; the only limitation is the relatively low immediate risk around the central event.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting work is outstanding: the wrong-colored light, “air that tastes like paper left too long in rain,” and the rooftop garden under meteors all feel tactile and lived-in. The rooftop and building aren’t just backdrop; they literally become the speaking entity, and the roof’s history (flowers, near-fire, arguments) constrains what is at stake. The antique seal as a recurring object bridges apartment and roof and charges the final image in the narrator’s hand. The only thing keeping this from a 9+ is that the environment shapes meaning more than it constrains concrete choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—gaining access to the “language of old buildings” before demolition erases it—is clear, but largely conceptual and unopposed. Escalation comes via deepening rather than conflict: the weekly ritual culminates in the meteor night, when the building finally speaks through the seal. There’s a meaningful turn when the “agreed upon lies” of tenancy are revealed as part of the building’s language, reweighting what the narrator thought they wanted. However, there’s little active resistance or sacrifice in the present moment, so the pressure never fully bites.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of translation, memory, denial, and cohabiting with decay are woven through events instead of preached. The idea that “agreed upon lies” underpin both the narrator–tutor relationship and the tenants’ coexistence with a failing building lands strongly in the closing paragraphs. Death as “a scheduling issue” and the building’s un-happened fire set up a nuanced meditation on what is postponed or refused to keep living somewhere. The insight that learning a building’s language means carrying its denials as gently as its truths feels earned and avoids pat moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The first-person voice is confident, patterned, and consistent, with vivid, idiosyncratic metaphors that feel native to this consciousness (“etiquette manual had opened in my spine,” “universe was busy writing drafts”). The tutor’s dialogue has a distinct, dryly precise cadence that contrasts with the narrator’s more sensory interiority, giving clear voice distinction. Psychic distance is stable and well controlled; reflective lines are anchored in concrete present stimuli. The lyricism is dense but rarely tips into self-indulgence, maintaining clarity of perception and stance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence does double duty for atmosphere and character, and the prose reads smoothly aloud with varied syntax. Metaphors are frequent but coherent and thematically linked to paper, language, weather, and architecture, creating a unified texture rather than a random grab-bag. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; the narrative moves forward with each paragraph, and the final image is clean and charged. The only restraint on going higher is the sheer density of figurative language, which risks feeling slightly uniform in cadence across the entire piece.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—a dead language tutor who mediates conversations with buildings, using an antique seal during a meteor shower as the cosmos’ “drafts”—feels genuinely fresh. The concept of “agreed upon lies” as structural to both human tenancy and architectural memory gives the ghost story an original ethical and linguistic twist. The story commits fully to its strange rules (tea that passes through his hands, the building’s braided voice) without overexplaining. The final repricing of what it means to “translate a building” is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight, meeting a high bar for ingenuity.</comment>
