<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrator’s blend of professional detachment and involuntary awe is specific and consistent, and their horror at “They turn into this” versus Mara’s correction shows real internal conflict. Motivation (to do reconnaissance for the institute) stays legible even as their understanding shifts, and micro-choices—what they notice, whether to challenge Mara—reveal a hierarchy of values. The cost at the end is more conceptual than dramatized, but the implied foreclosure of a simple “threat map” mindset is earned. Mara is vivid and pressure-bearing, though her own stakes could be sharpened slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Structure is clean: arrival → threshold (arrowhead) → core garden and phone → revelation about the missing → reframed understanding. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: each new phenomenon (lamps, door, bowls, phone, voices) deepens the same central question. Closure is a solid conceptual repricing—the missing are not “taken” but metamorphosed into something the mountain needs—though the protagonist’s resulting tactical choice vis-à-vis the institute remains offstage. Everything needed for comprehension and before/after is on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is extraordinarily vivid and specific (“fallen through a bruise in reality,” inverted trees, chamomile fog on the ceiling), and always filtered through the cryptid researcher’s sensibility. The environment isn’t just pretty: the root-door with its “tooth,” the bowls, and the underground garden’s pulsing soil all actively carry the world’s rules and charge the final understanding. The garden’s logic is internally consistent, and the stone/arrowhead-root arch meaningfully shapes access and stakes. This environment and its tools are inseparable from the story’s meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding what is “taking” the missing people—appears early and tightens as the narrator moves inward from threshold to heart of the garden. The chief deepening is the realization that the missing have become seeds of a mountain-scale chorus, which reweights the initial threat premise. That said, conflict is almost entirely epistemic; there’s little sense of a hard choice or price in the moment beyond internal horror and wonder. Pressure is strong for a lyric piece but doesn’t fully crystallize into a difficult decision on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—on metamorphosis, consent, and reconfiguring “threat” into relational ecology—emerges organically from particulars like the bone bowls, confessions-as-seeds, and “what the mountain cannot carry alone.” The idea that the missing are redistributed rather than erased is powerful and lingers, and the line about making “the bones of the mountain less lonely” reweights the entire phenomenon. The final sentence about “turn bitterness into a cosmic joke” flirts with on-the-nose abstraction but is grounded enough in the preceding images not to feel like a tacked-on moral. Overall, resonance is high and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The first-person voice is assured and distinctive—simultaneously clinical (“taxonomy,” “field liaison for anomalous fauna”) and lushly sensory, which suits a scientist in a numinous setting. Diction and metaphor choices feel rooted in this narrator’s training and psychology, and the distance stays consistent. Mara’s sparse spoken lines are tonally distinct and carry subtext without exposition. Rhythm and sentence length modulate well between observation and revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, figurative language is striking and usually coherent, and information density is high with little true scaffolding. A few metaphors verge on purple or stack somewhat (“bruise in reality,” “harmony untamed”) but they’re thematically aligned rather than gratuitous. There’s minimal redundancy and the syntax remains clear even in complex images. The final line is the weakest stylistically—slightly abstract compared to prior concrete images—but doesn’t significantly dull the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of cryptid-investigation, animist mountain ecology, confession-seeds, and an underground herbalist garden feels genuinely fresh and inevitable in hindsight. “Harmony untamed” as literally embodied in plants grown from human confessions is an uncommon and powerful conceptual move. The story fully commits to its weird premise and follows through without over-explaining, giving it a singular artistic stance. This is the kind of risk-taking speculative-literate hybrid that could run in a top venue with minimal revision.</comment>
