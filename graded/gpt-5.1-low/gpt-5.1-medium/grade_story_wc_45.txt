<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara is sharply drawn as a “forgiving skeptic,” and her doubt-driven micro-choices (calling out the corpse, following the private map, deciding to finish Tomas’s attempt) feel specific and earned. Her internal conflict between mistrust of miracles and affection for Tomas’s impossible compassion is woven through rather than told. The displaced boy is lightly sketched but his “shrewdly innocent” trust undercuts her skepticism at the climax in a credible way. The final stance—accepting doubt as “almost bearable”—reads as an earned, character-specific shift rather than a neat epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The causal spine is clean: suspicious corpse → secret garden → tooth/folio knowledge → portal → bone-setting rescue → crumbling substitute body and reweighted doubt. The drive lens is primarily causal with a strong thematic overlay, and the story executes a clear decisive change (she crosses over and brings the boy back) plus a resonant reconfiguration of what doubt means to her. Every major setup (the forged body, Tomas’s compassion, the tooth’s lore, the garden as sky) pays off at or before the ending image. If anything, the practical risks of crossing and failing are implied more than dramatized, slightly softening the sense of concrete cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The hedge maze, secret garden, improvised instruments, and violet-sky otherworld are vivid, selective, and tightly filtered through Mara’s sensibility as a bone setter and skeptic. The garden is not postcard scenery; it functions as Tomas’s “sky,” the locus of his experiments, and the necessary site for the portal and the boy’s rescue. The corpse on the table, the tin box, and the hedge at dawn all recur to charge the final image of the substitute body turned to soil and the maze/garden folding like a book. Setting could constrain immediate physical options a bit more explicitly, but as a symbolic and practical container for the action it is highly effective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stakes—truth about Tomas’s fate and the moral obligation to the mislaid child—are clear and sharpen as Mara moves from diagnosing a fake corpse to choosing whether to complete a dangerous, ethically fraught experiment. The pressure escalates coherently: doubt over the body → unsettling proof of faerie mechanics → direct vision of the suffering boy → the high-agency decision to step through and re-set his bones into her world’s physics. The rescue is somewhat frictionless on the page (no resistance once she commits), so the felt cost leans more conceptual/emotional than bodily or logistical. Still, her decision clearly forecloses the safer path of letting the substitute stand and simply sharing in the village’s comforting lie.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The thematic weave around doubt, belief, error, and “turning mistakes into constellations” is unusually integrated; nearly every object and choice refracts those concerns without sliding into essay. Tomas’s stolen tooth, substitute body, and shifting maze all embody his refusal to accept misfiled lives as acceptable clerical errors, while Mara embodies the counter-stance of wary, human-scale forgiveness. Her final acceptance of doubt as “almost bearable,” after literally mapping corrections onto Tomas’s imagined sky through the boy’s bones, offers a resonant, non-didactic answer to the central question of how to live with uncertainty and cosmic bureaucracy. A few phrasings (“clumsy paperwork,” “turn mistakes into constellations”) brush the edge of explicit theme-statement but remain grounded enough in concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The first-person voice is confident, idiosyncratic, and consistent, blending professional bone-setter concreteness with a dry, slightly bitter lyricism (“a counterfeit body in a world that preferred smudges”). Diction and metaphor feel appropriate to Mara’s intelligence and experience, and the narrative distance stays stable even as the prose becomes more lyrical in the garden and portal sequences. Patterned phrases (“shrewdly innocent”) recur in a controlled way that builds motif rather than feeling like template churn. There is no head-hopping or register drift, and the modulation from sardonic to tender by the end is smooth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The line-level craft is dense and efficient, with many sentences doing double duty as image, characterization, and theme (“scars arranged like careful handwriting, a counterfeit body in a world that preferred smudges”). Figurative language is frequent but well-controlled; metaphors tend to share a semantic field (paperwork, maps, constellations) and do not collide. There are no notable loops, scaffolding phrases, or clarity issues; the prose maintains momentum even in reflective moments. A few lines risk feeling slightly over-packed in close succession, but they do not obscure causality or dull the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a village bone setter, changeling lore, bureaucratic metaphors for the universe, and a secret garden as experimental sky feels fresh and organic rather than gimmicky. The substitute body/receipt tooth premise and the idea of “forgiving the universe its clumsy paperwork” are particularly inventive turns on familiar faerie-swap tropes. The rescue via bone-setting—translating a body grown under different physics—is an original, character-grounded solution. Overall, the piece takes real aesthetic risks in concept and language that cohere under pressure and closure.</comment>
