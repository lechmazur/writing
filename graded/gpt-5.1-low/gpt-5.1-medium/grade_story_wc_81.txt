<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation—“to trace honest origins”—is clear, specific, and coherently pursued, and her perceptual habits (reading spines, noticing gaps) feel individualized. Her quiet persistence against the settlement’s preference for “myths” grounds her as a mildly oppositional figure without tipping into archetype. However, internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized; the peace-vs-truth tension (“Peaceful, she thought now, or sedated”) could be embodied in one sharper moment of doubt or fear as she proceeds. The closing discovery is earned, but the emotional cost of that discovery remains largely conceptual rather than fully felt in her body or immediate reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive: the blackout → altered atmosphere → inspection of gaps → hidden folio → testimonies, culminating in a conceptual repricing of the library’s role. Orientation is clean and early, with who/where/when all legible within the first few lines. Closure lands in the on-page discovery of the hillside testimonies and forged stamp, reconfiguring the premise of the “democratic ark” with social cost (the settlement’s peace is founded on erasure). The structure is simple but coherent; the only limitation is that the decisive change is intellectual and retrospective rather than forcing a new on-page decision in the final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The sunken city and breathing, forgotten library are rendered with vivid, selective detail (“blackout fell like velvet over rust,” “water held respectfully still”), tightly filtered through Mara’s attention. Environmental specifics—the depths, blackout, lantern, stamp, mineral-stained aisles—aren’t mere backdrop; they condition what she can see and do and charge the final discovery. The rules of this underwater world feel internally consistent without exposition dumps. The only reason this doesn’t breach the 9-band is that the environment constrains mood and perception more than it directly blocks or forces specific physical choices in the closing beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake is Mara’s pursuit of truthful origins versus the settlement’s preference for pacifying myth; this is clearly signaled and returns at the end. Escalation is modest but present: the blackout removes oversight, heightens the sense of risk/possibility, and she moves from abstract suspicion to concrete evidence. The discovery of the hidden folio and imitation stamp is a genuine deepening of conflict, narrowing interpretive options about the library’s past. Still, the tension remains largely intellectual and atmospheric—no immediate counterforce or explicit consequence presses on her in the moment of revelation, slightly softening perceived cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of archival power, selective memory, and the politics of survival emerge organically from objects (the stamp), absences (missing communities), and the final testimonies, rather than from didactic statements. The contrast between “democratic ark” myth and the curated erasure of hillside voices is sharp and resonant, especially in the image of the forged, undated stamp. Lines like “gaps spoke louder than surviving spines” work as earned insight tied to her lived task. A few formulations (“myths were what kept the settlement peaceful”) come close to thesis-stating, keeping this slightly below top-tier subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature—Mara “read spines the way other people read faces” and hears the library’s “breathing darkness.” Diction, rhythm, and metaphor feel consistent with a contemplative, meticulous archivist in a strange environment; there’s no head-hopping or stance drift. The prose modulates well with pressure, becoming tighter and more focused as she approaches the hidden folio. A hair of high-register abstraction appears in spots, but it fits the established voice and doesn’t disrupt clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and minimal redundancy; metaphors are generally clean and apt (“pages stuck together like reluctant lips,” “blackout fell like velvet over rust”). The rhythm supports the contemplative pressure without bogging down; almost every line advances setting, theme, or character simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but not so stacked as to blur sense, and there are no notable scaffold sentences or loops. Slight flirtations with purple prose in a few phrases are the only thing keeping this just below elite-range.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The combination of a sunken-city library, a human card catalog, and a blackout-enabled revelation of curated erasure feels fresh and thoughtfully integrated. The antique stamp as a truth-of-arrival symbol, then as a forged, blank marker of non-recognition, is an especially inventive throughline. The emotional arc—quietly subversive archivist versus comforting myth—is familiar but given specificity through underwater civic politics and dam protests. It stops short of a truly startling final turn or formally risky move, but the synthesis is distinctive and memorable.</comment>
