<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrator’s vocation, sensory bias, and sense of obligation are sharply rendered, and their micro-choices (humming, prying open the door, reading aloud, ultimately staying) track cleanly with those traits. The internal tug between walking away and accepting “legacy’s burden” is present but remains relatively quiet and cerebral rather than fully dramatized under sharper pressure. Embodied emotion is strong in textures of touch, smell, and fatigue, though the psychological cost of staying could be made a notch more specific. Overall, this is a well-motivated, particular consciousness on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: each discovery (echo tremor → door → diaries → film → Mara’s notes → second echo) deepens the same core situation rather than flipping it. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when and job premise are all quickly established). Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid in the decision to redraw the map and stay, with clear before/after in relation to walking away, though the external stakes of that choice remain understated. Structure is coherent and satisfying for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ruined university, ivy, wet stone, salt wind, and warped post-climate architecture are vividly and economically drawn, always filtered through the echo-cartographer’s priorities. Setting is not postcard; the ivy literally conceals the fire door, the prior blaze and flooding define what can be found, and the environment’s “groaning” weaves into the sonic premise. The final image of staying “until the walls finished dreaming” is fully charged by how thoroughly the building has been established as a quasi-conscious environment. World rules for the climate-shifted campus hold consistently without expository drag.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to assume the inherited task of listening to a possibly conscious building—is clear and grows as the narrator uncovers Mara and feels the walls’ attention. Escalation is primarily conceptual and atmospheric rather than confrontational, which suits the mode but keeps pressure fairly low-key. The decisive choice to stay does foreclose the option of filing an incomplete report and leaving, but the practical or emotional costs of that renunciation could be sharpened. Still, there is one solid tightening when the echo “tests the contours” of the narrator’s name and binds them to continue.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of legacy, listening as an ethical act, and ruins retaining memory are woven through concrete particulars (Mara’s notes, the film of the child, the building’s layered echoes) rather than abstract thesis. The phrase “Legacy's burden” veers close to explicit naming but is supported by enough dramatized experience that it doesn’t feel like a grafted moral. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: to honor legacy is to keep listening, accepting the weight of unfinished questions. Ambiguity about what the walls ultimately are keeps the piece from feeling pat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The first-person voice has a distinct, consistent perceptual signature—thinking in acoustics and echoes, likening diaries to petals and walls to listeners—that feels organic to this character. Tense and distance are stable, with controlled lyricism that tightens in the key beats (both humming moments, the decision to stay). There is no head-hopping or gratuitous exposition; reflection is anchored to present stimuli (echoes, diaries, weather). The register is elevated but plausible for this introspective specialist, and rhythm shows good variation without slipping into mannerism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with most images doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and coherent (“pages charred at the edges like petals touched by frost,” “lectures rising like underwater bells”) without piling up into purple excess. There is minimal repetition or scaffold; almost every line advances mood, world, or situation. Minor density in a few metaphor-rich sentences does not impede clarity or dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise of a “corridor echo cartographer” mapping how sound remembers a climate-warped university is fresh, and the idea of buildings accruing a kind of sonic consciousness via sedimented echoes is quietly striking. Integrating legacy through a predecessor’s diaries and film of corridor-dreams deepens that originality rather than feeling like a bolt-on twist. The emotional arc—accepting the burden to listen rather than flee—fits the concept in a non-obvious way, avoiding stock haunted-building beats. While not radically experimental, the synthesis of climate fiction, acoustic mapping, and haunted-legacy meditation feels memorable and specific.</comment>
