<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The janitor’s interiority is specific, textured, and consistent, with a clear contradiction between his practiced invisibility and his longing to witness and be witnessed. His spiritual shyness, empathy for objects, and workmanlike habits all feed his reactions to the lantern and visions. The final stance shift—from “shadow with a mop” to someone who can stand and be seen—is motivated by prior beats, though the epiphany is compressed. Emotional embodiment is mostly through image and perception rather than body, but it still feels grounded.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The accumulative structure is clean: late shift arrival → discovery of lantern → activation of projections → deepening visions → conceptual reconfiguration at the end. Causality is intact and legible under a textural/accumulative lens, and the closure (his promise to keep watching, revaluing his role) lands with a clear before/after. Stakes remain largely internal but are coherently escalated through increasingly charged images and realizations rather than any outline-y sequencing. Cost is present as the ache, exposure, and relinquishing of invisibility, even if quiet.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The shooting star tracking station and dome are vividly rendered and tightly integrated into the action—the dust, old instruments, and dome projections aren’t backdrop but active participants in the scene. The environment shapes what can happen (he is alone in a long-abandoned observatory; the dome becomes the screen of memory and revelation), and the recurring objects (broom, console, lantern glass, dome) directly charge the final image. Sensory details (dust, ozone, metallic tang) filter through his particular attention as a custodian, deepening both atmosphere and character. The setting’s “forgotten” status mirrors and intensifies his own, crucially supporting the thematic turn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The central stake—whether he persists in erasing himself or allows his vulnerability and attention to matter—emerges clearly and grows as the visions move from abstract stars to specific human moments. Pressure escalates internally as he’s emotionally targeted by the projections (“as if those questions were aimed only at him”) and as his worldview about work, care, and the universe is challenged. However, opposition remains largely atmospheric rather than actively resisting; the cost is psychological and conceptual rather than dramatized through difficult external trade-offs. The crystallizing choice to “keep watching” is earned but operates in a low-key, contemplative register.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of maintenance as care, overlooked labor, cosmic empathy, and finding strength in vulnerability emerge organically from particulars: the broom as staff, mopping as witnessing, the universe “resting” and needing its forgotten corners tended. The lantern glass and falling stars reweight from scientific data to emotional trajectories, elegantly embodying the idea that motion and impact are suffused with feeling. Some lines verge on explicit theme statement (“perhaps the job was never just to clean, but to witness”), softening the subtlety a bit. Still, the ending’s charged poise offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer about visibility, tenderness, and endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent and distinct, with a contemplative, gently poetic cadence that suits both the character and the premise. Word choice and images feel filtered through a quietly observant custodian whose metaphors are often drawn from work and matter (dust, buckets, pipes) even as they reach toward the cosmic. Tense and distance remain stable; there’s no head-hopping or unearned omniscience. The rhythmic modulation as the visions intensify and then pause in “flourishing stillness” shows good control without slipping into self-consciousness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is dense but largely efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere, theme, and character. Metaphors are mostly fresh and coherent (“dust that glimmered like crushed nebulae,” “threads of molten silver…like thoughts before they learn their names”), and syntactic variety prevents drumbeat monotony. There is a high figurative load that skirts purple at moments, yet clarity holds and momentum doesn’t stall. Redundancy and scaffolding are minimal, and the final line cleanly recharges earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of a “cosmic janitor,” abandoned tracking station, and an almost mystical monitoring device that reveals emotional trajectories feels distinctive and lived-in rather than gimmicky. Reframing falling stars as vectors of human choice and care is a fresh conceptual move that integrates with character and theme. The idea of the universe itself “resting” and needing its corners mopped transforms familiar cosmic awe into something tender and vulnerable. While not utterly alien to speculative-literary traditions, the specific synthesis and quiet risks in tone and premise are notably strong.</comment>
