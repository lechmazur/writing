<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior life is rich and specific: a phobia-ridden stunt double whose job and temperament are in tension, with anger and fear coexisting credibly (“my body kinked around fear like a wire around a magnet”). Her micro-choices—remaining in the library, engaging the boy, choosing to write on the cast, deciding to confront the studio—track cleanly from that psychology. The boy is sketched quickly but distinctly and functions as a meaningful relational crucible rather than a prop. The final stance shift toward “weaponizing every quiver in me” feels earned by prior beats and carries cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The causal spine is clean: discovery of erased identity → exile to the library → encounter with the cast and cipher → reframed understanding of fear → decision to confront the studio. Structure is linear and easy to follow within a single scene window, with backstory and reflection always anchored to concrete present stimuli (file burning, cast list, cast). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she has not yet acted, but options and stakes are reweighted, and the risk of challenging the studio is legible. No major orientation or lens issues; the Causal/accumulative hybrid drive holds consistently to the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The “rusted library under stars we used for night shoots” is vivid, specific, and thematically apt as a graveyard of scripts and identities. Details like “metal ribs gone orange with decay” and books in “clear plastic like organs in jars” are strongly filtered through the POV and echo the body/organ motif. The seashell prop and soundstage ceiling recur to charge the closing image with a sense of artificial yet consoling environment. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, it meaningfully shapes mood and the metaphorical sense of being warehoused and interchangeable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—will she accept erasure or claim authorship of her own danger—is signaled early and tightens as concrete evidence of disposability accumulates (burned file, cast list, memo language). Conflict is primarily internal but interwoven with the external power imbalance with the studio and the child’s presence, which pressures her self-concept. The decoding of the cast marks the key deepening; it transforms her fear from liability to potential tool and compels a bolder, riskier stance. The only slight limitation is that opposition remains offstage, so the escalated cost is projected rather than directly tested in-scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—vulnerability as power, authorship over one’s scripted role, naming fear as resistance—emerges organically through the stunt work context, the child’s cipher, and the “backup body” language. Subtext is often strong (the cast as rewritten script, the seashell’s half-finished sentence), and the emotional aftereffect is poignant rather than sentimental. Some sentences tilt toward thesis (“If the studio had rewritten my name, I could rewrite my purpose”) and the final paragraph comes close to explicitly stating the moral calculus, slightly reducing ambiguity. Still, the culminating image of “trembling certainty” as leverage keeps the piece from collapsing into mere slogan.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The first-person voice is distinct and consistent, with a perceptual signature grounded in film/stunt vocabulary and corporate language that fits the character’s world. Syntax and rhythm are varied and controlled, leaning lyric without losing clarity; metaphors (studio as script-god, body as prop) are coherent and character-appropriate. Dialogue between narrator and boy is concise, natural, and carries subtext—his shrugging pragmatism against her shaken poise. Psychic distance is managed well, allowing both sharp sensory detail and reflective commentary without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences are information-dense, avoid redundancy, and often do double-duty for setting, character, and theme. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and largely unmuddled; images like “books sealed in clear plastic like organs in jars” or “a fight choreographer's map lets terror become timing” are fresh and legible. There are no obvious scaffold sentences, loops, or template cadences, and rhythm modulates effectively from long, meditative lines to tighter beats around key realizations. A slight tilt toward lushness keeps it out of the absolute top band but does not harm propulsion or clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise—an identity-erased, phobic stunt double discovering agency via a child’s coded cast in a rusting prop library—is strikingly original in combination, not just in surface. The film-industry bureaucracy, “backup body” concept, and child’s self-authored cipher all feel like specific, non-template choices that meaningfully alter plot and theme. The central turn—reframing fear itself as the irreplaceable element the studio needs—is a non-obvious yet inevitable-feeling synthesis of prior details. This level of risk and specificity would stand out even in a strong submissions pile.</comment>
