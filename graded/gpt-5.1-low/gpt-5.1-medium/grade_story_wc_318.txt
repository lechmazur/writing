<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lysander’s grief, ritualistic creativity, and “mournfully eager” drive are vivid and specific, and his choice to orchestrate this bizarre concert is fully motivated by the established loss. His interiority is mostly carried through image and action rather than direct thought, but the tuning-fork metaphor and the months of leaf-sweeping rehearsals clarify his psychology. The parents function more as pressured presences than as developed characters, but their brief on-page reactions are emotionally credible and matter to his goal. The final realization—that tending to the unspoken is endless—feels earned and rooted in what we’ve seen him do.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The piece follows a clear accumulative structure: preparation in the tunnel, activation of the “symphony,” upstairs reverberation, then a quiet reconfiguration at the end. Causality is clean—Lysander’s actions directly provoke the house’s response and the parents’ first laughter since Mara’s death. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the household’s silence cracks and Lysander reframes his work as ongoing labor rather than a one-off exorcism. The scene remains focused on one dominant stake with no orientation issues or dangling setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The echo chamber tunnel, the old house, and recurring objects like the egg timer and leaf blowers are richly rendered and functionally integrated. The acoustics of the tunnel and the house’s vents/brickwork materially shape how the ritual works and how laughter travels back. Setting details (mold writing stories, dust understanding the clatter, limescale silence) mirror the emotional state without feeling like mere decoration. The final image of the warm pull cord in the tunnel and the air holding “the shape of a smile” shows the environment still charged by the story’s events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The central stake—coaxing laughter back into a grief-stalled household—is clear and personal, and pressure coheres as Lysander moves from setup to roaring engines to the risky, vulnerable singing. The primary tightening is the transition from building sound to the upstairs reaction; hearing the laughter is the payoff that tests whether his strange method can work. The cost is mostly emotional exposure and the bittersweet realization that his work isn’t done rather than a sharp, on-page dilemma or sacrifice. Stakes are felt and escalate appropriately for this quiet mode, but there’s no major reversal or hard trade-off that would push pressure into the very top tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of unspoken grief, swallowed laughter, and the labor of tending to what people suppress are woven through concrete motifs (unfinished punchlines, dust, mold-stories, egg timer) rather than abstract statement. The idea that noise and “off-key wind” can surface what silence has buried is dramatized rather than preached. The near-explicit line “this work of tending to the unspoken will never be finished” edges toward thematic statement but is justified by the preceding scene and doesn’t feel like a tacked-on moral. The ending leaves a resonant, bittersweet sense of ongoing obligation without neat resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The third-person voice is lyrically omniscient but stable, with a distinct texture of metaphors and cadences that suits the haunted-domestic premise. Brief dips into the parents’ perceptions are cleanly handled and consistent with a controlled, close-leaning omniscient stance. Diction (“macerates,” “bruise resonance,” “grainy and frayed, like old film burning”) is elevated yet coherent for this narrative voice and keeps emotional pressure intact. Rhythm shifts appropriately between long, lush sentences for atmosphere and slightly tighter lines when the engines roar and reactions land.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is dense but purposeful, with most sentences doing multiple jobs—advancing action, embodying emotion, and maintaining atmosphere. Figurative language is frequent yet controlled; images like laughter as “phantom” blooming in sound pockets and silence settling “like limescale” feel precise rather than florid. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic monotony, and the final lines land cleanly without metaphor muddle. The only slight constraint on a higher score is that the figurative density is near the upper limit where, in a few spots, image layering risks drawing attention to craft over moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The core conceit—using leaf blowers as a grief-conducting orchestra in an echoing tunnel to resurrect laughter—is strikingly original and well followed through. Familiar motifs of haunted houses and bereavement are transformed via idiosyncratic tools (yard equipment, egg timer) and a non-obvious emotional calculus (restoring laughter rather than banishing ghosts). The final conceptual turn—that this ritual is less an exorcism than a lifelong maintenance of the unspoken—reweights the whole piece in a fresh way. It feels singular enough to be memorable while remaining emotionally grounded rather than clever for its own sake.</comment>
