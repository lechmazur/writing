<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Nari’s motivation—refusing to accept her brother’s disappearance and needing a medium that outlasts words—is clear, specific, and consistently drives her choices. Her emotional life is embodied through tactile relationships to thread, bead, and loom rather than label-words. The final sacrifice of the tapestry is well-earned by the decade of weaving and the puzzle’s revealed nature. The main limitation is a relative lack of on-page hesitation or contradictory impulses at the moment of sacrifice, which could sharpen her internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The structure is clean and accumulative: orchard → backstory → market → puzzle assembly → sacrifice → charged final breath, all tied to Nari’s throughline. Causality is solid: she buys the puzzle because of Haru, discovers its blizzard-window function, and must pay with the tapestry to complete it. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her world is altered by the finished window and the implied answer from Haru, at the cost of ten years of work. The piece stays within one coherent lens and scale, with no orientation or rule-breaking issues.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The orchard among bamboo, with shriveled apples and swallowed paths, is vividly rendered and deeply integrated into tone and stakes. The setting supports Nari’s solitude, the forgotten quality of her craft, and the plausibility of this private magic. Environmental details (frost on fallen apples, moonlight through bamboo, the loom at the orchard’s heart) evolve with the action and charge the final scene with age and cost (“the orchard felt abruptly older”). The world feels distinctive yet legible, with setting functioning as more than backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Nari can meaningfully reach Haru across time and death—is legible early and escalates when the puzzle reveals the blizzard scene. Pressure tightens around the choice to finish the puzzle by sacrificing her life’s tapestry, creating a real trade-off between clinging to the old message-medium and risking a more direct contact. Internal and external conflicts interweave quietly yet effectively via the cost to her identity as a weaver. The main ceiling is that resistance and alternative options are only lightly dramatized, making the escalation feel slightly smooth rather than sharply contested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of memory, loss, the inadequacy of language, and the cost of any bridge across “impossible distance” emerge organically from Nari’s craft and choices. Recurring motifs—the bead, the loom, the puzzle-as-loom, and the orchard’s forgotten graft—reweight by the end into a meditation on sacrifice as the price of true communication. There is no overt moralizing; the final image leaves space to question whether the cost was worth the faint answering heartbeat. The only modest limitation is that the thematic field (thread/time/silence) is rich but somewhat familiar for high-literary venues.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Nari’s sensibility, with a strong preference for textile and temporal metaphors. Rhythm and diction are controlled, with sentences modulating in length and texture to suit reflection or quiet tension. The narrative avoids explanatory scaffolding and trusts image and implication, while remaining clear. This is a distinct, confident voice with very few slips, though its lyricism stays in a relatively safe register rather than taking formally bolder risks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is high: nearly every sentence carries multiple functions (world, mood, character) with minimal redundancy, and metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned. Phrasing like “raveling silence” and “a loom turned sideways” feels fresh yet lucid rather than purple. There are no meaningful artifacts, template cadences, or clarity lapses, and the final sentences land with precision and economy. The main constraint on an even higher score is that density of lyricism remains steady rather than dynamically sharpening at the moment of sacrifice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of a prophetic loom, a forgotten bamboo-apple orchard, and a jigsaw puzzle that becomes a sideways loom to a blizzard-lost brother feels genuinely fresh. The magical logic grows naturally from Nari’s vocation and the world’s textures rather than reading like a bolt-on gimmick. Emotional stakes (grief, stubborn hope, sacrifice) are handled with specificity rather than genre shorthand, and the final image (footsteps turning) reconfigures the premise in a non-obvious, satisfying way. The only slight limit is that certain motifs (threads/time) echo well-trodden literary territory even as the particular arrangement is distinctive.</comment>
