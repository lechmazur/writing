<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mara’s longing to locate “where unused love is stored” is vivid, embodied, and consistent, and her final revaluation of the goodbye letters feels earned by what she witnesses. Her interiority (“secret egg under the ribs,” the chest-ache) is concrete and particular. The projectionist is sketched efficiently as a foil and guide. The only limit is that her internal conflict never bites quite hard enough into an on-page dilemma; the realization comes smoothly rather than against visible resistance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → touch/reading → projection → realization, all causally legible under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—unused love as deleted scenes—and the final choice to see her letters as “unfinished reels” gives a clear before/after. There are no orientation issues; the palace, booth, and sequence of actions are easy to follow. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than dramatized in a difficult choice, which keeps this shy of the very top tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The vintage movie palace and projection booth are richly evoked through selective, sense-driven detail (“rain braided the neon,” “dust, hot metal, and slept-through matinees”). Setting is tightly integrated with theme: the palace as a heart that’s lost its beat, the booth as a repository for cut scenes, and the final image of the film cooling in her hand. The environment meaningfully frames the premise but doesn’t quite constrain a concrete tactical choice in the moment, which keeps it just under the 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—resolving what happens to unused love—remains clear throughout and deepens as she sees others’ unsent gestures and her own younger self. Pressure escalates via the intensifying visions and the uncanny projection on the booth wall, culminating in a reconfiguration of how she relates to her own goodbyes. However, the conflict is largely contemplative; Mara never faces a tight either/or or a visibly costly trade-off on the page, so the tension is more meditative than gripping.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of memory, omission, and the persistence of unexpressed love are woven through concrete images (cut film, unsent letters, aborted hugs) rather than abstract exposition. The metaphor of unused love as deleted scenes stored in “dark cans” is resonant and reweights the entire story at the end. Lines like “So that is where it goes…” edge toward explicit thesis, slightly flattening subtext. Overall, the emotional aftereffect and conceptual frame are strong and linger beyond the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The third-person limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Mara’s sensibility (buildings as organs, stairwells as arteries). Rhythm and diction are controlled, with sentences modulating well between description and interiority. Dialogue is spare but distinct and functional, with the projectionist’s lines carrying clean, understated authority. The lyricism occasionally brushes purple but remains coherent and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is polished, with high information density and minimal scaffolding; most lines carry atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but largely precise and thematically aligned (film, hearts, storms), passing the read-aloud and coherence tests. There’s little to no synonym churn or paraphrase looping, and syntax varies enough to maintain momentum. A few metaphoric clusters (“secret egg,” “hushed thunder,” “lighthouse in fog”) come close to saturation, but they don’t obscure clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of a vintage projection booth, psychometry, and the idea of unused love as cut film scenes is fresh and conceptually elegant. The story commits to this conceit and follows it through in specific, grounded ways (spliced-out footage, margins of remembered stories, projection on the booth wall). Emotional truth about unsent goodbyes anchors the invention, preventing it from feeling like a gimmick. The only reason not to go higher is that the internal arc remains relatively gentle rather than taking a truly surprising or unsettling turn.</comment>
