<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and specific—the narrator’s guilt over the prizewinning short, his arrogance, and his need to “lean away from harm” all feel lived-in. Lily and Marcus are efficiently but distinctly drawn through their commitments and the way they argue. The final mutual-reframing exercise grows convincingly out of these traits and flaws. The only reason this doesn’t land even higher is that Lily and Marcus, while strong, remain a touch schematic compared to the narrator’s depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The structure is tight: prior off-page argument → hush → confrontation → reversal exercise → quiet reconfiguration, all causally linked. Backstory (the exploitative film, the puppet shows) is cleanly anchored and directly sharpens the present stakes rather than drifting. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: their perspectives and the orbiting-stories image reweight the entire ethical question with felt cost. Nothing important teleports or resets; the scene feels fully earned at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome, mezzanine, safety rail, and dormant dish are vivid and consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility. The setting mirrors and pressures the ethics debate (surveillance, incoming fire, blind listening) and physically encodes status—him above, them below—until the perspective-swapping exercise softens that hierarchy. The final image of the dome “listening” as stories choose “to orbit together” is a charged reprise that couldn’t happen in a generic room. World details (bars, puppet stage) are selective and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The central stake—whether ethical storytelling is possible or inherently harmful—is clear and under pressure from the first mention of the students’ argument. Conflict escalates from off-stage shouting to direct accusation (“stay clean up there”) to the high-risk empathy exercise where misrepresentation is the losing condition. The cost is primarily emotional and ethical vulnerability rather than overtly life-altering consequence, but it’s legible and appropriate to the scale. A slightly sharper on-page sense of what might rupture between them if this fails would push tension even higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme is deeply woven: silence as complicity, exploitation in representation, and the possibility of nonviolent storytelling all emerge from concrete choices and images, not abstract essaying. Lines like “Because silence is the cruelest author I know” skate close to aphorism but are fully earned by the backstory of the grieving family and the bar shows. The half-lit epiphanies and meteor/orbit imagery elegantly reframe the initial argument at the end without handing down a simple moral. Ambiguity remains—harm is not solved, only reconfigured—yet the piece feels conceptually decisive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The first-person voice is distinctive—wry, lyrical, and ethically self-scrutinizing—and stays consistent throughout. Diction comfortably accommodates both metaphor (“ink dries fastest when people below are on fire”) and plainspoken dialogue; Lily and Marcus sound plausibly different in rhythm and stance. POV distance is well-controlled, allowing both reflective summary and in-the-moment pressure without confusion. Any occasional high-flown phrasing reads as this particular narrator’s mind rather than authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line by line, the prose is dense and precise, with many sentences doing double duty for setting, psychology, and theme (“half-lit epiphanies hovered over the group, glow worms of insight that refused to land on anyone”). Rhythm varies effectively; there are no obvious scaffolding loops or template cadences. The metaphor load is high but mostly coherent and pattern-consistent (dome/eye, meteor/orbit, fire/ink), with only the occasional risk of over-ornamentation. That slight excess—more than any real artifact—keeps this just shy of an absolutely pristine score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise of a “school for troubling stories” in a defunct radar dome, taught by a guilt-stricken calligrapher who atones via subversive puppet shows, feels strikingly singular. The ethical-arts-school setup could have felt familiar, but the dome-as-sentinel, the campfire story stick, and the reversed-confession puppetry all transform it into something new. The climactic exercise—telling the argument from each other’s POV and letting the stomach be the judge—is an inventive, character-driven turn, not a gimmick. The final image of stories choosing “to orbit together” synthesizes the piece’s risks into a memorable, non-obvious closure.</comment>
