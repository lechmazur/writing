<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The protagonist’s inner life is vivid, particular, and embodied—her envy of “yesterday’s version” and of the eagle and even the corpse is sharply character-specific. Motivation (trying to tame chaos into narrative) is clear and consistently at odds with what the mountain/dreams demand. Micro-choices—writing “The mountain does not care…,” stepping outside, letting the scroll be erased—flow credibly from that tension and carry felt cost. The only minor limitation is that her emotional range tends to stay in one lyrical register of melancholy insight rather than showing more raw degradation under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The structure is cleanly accumulative: cabin → grave recollection → scroll instructions → mounting dream pressure → erasure in the snow, all cohering under an internal-existential drive lens. Causality is soft but legible—discovering the grave reweights her relation to the scroll, and the scroll’s imperatives guide her stance at the end. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: accepting cyclical time and erasure as continuation rather than clinging to story as ladder. A hairline critique is that the move from “record the flight, but do not land” to “let the mountain erase the scroll” is more conceptual rhyme than fully dramatized decision path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is exceptionally textured and integral: cedar smoke, iron stove, birch bark, grave between hemlocks, and blue-glass moonlight all filter through her sensibility. Environment continually shapes the beat—the stove sparks as failed comforting words, wind as a page turning, snow as erasure, and the stone pinning the scroll as a miniature monument. The mountain is not mere backdrop but an active, indifferent presence whose “want” (its minerals back) reframes her work and the final image. One could argue for even more tactile interaction with the physical cabin under pressure, but what’s here already constrains and charges choices meaningfully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The central stake—whether she can still believe in narrative as a way to live after confronting her own grave—is clear and sharpened by the scroll’s commands and the pressing dreams. Pressure escalates from eerie disquiet to the concrete act of sacrificing her written account to the snow, a quiet but real renunciation. Internal and external pressures (dreams pawing at the windows, time folding, future footprints) interweave effectively. Still, the conflict remains largely contemplative; there’s no sharp reversal or forced trade-off beyond mood-deepening, which keeps it just shy of top-tier stakes work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of time as wheel vs ladder, narrative vs entropy, and “feral nostalgia” for unrealized lives emerge organically from recurring images (spiral, grave, eagle, erasure). The final lesson that “erasure is also a form of continuation” conceptually reweights everything before it in a satisfying way. However, some lines tilt toward aphoristic direct statement—“The mountain does not care who remembers you” and “I was born twice…”—which feel slightly more like authorial theses than fully earned, resisted realizations. That faint sermonizing edge trims the score in an otherwise rich thematic weave.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent, with metaphors that clearly arise from this character’s mindscape (pages, ladders, wheels, archives). Rhythm varies well between long, sinuous sentences and shorter, cutting ones, matching shifts in pressure. The “jaded wonder” tone is well sustained without slipping into register that feels alien to her role or psyche. On the margin, occasional aphoristic constructions risk reading as slightly more essayistic than embodied, but they don’t break POV control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prose is lush and information-dense; nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs—world-building, interiority, and thematic charge—without major redundancy. The figurative language is mostly coherent and fresh (e.g., “autumn tongues,” “mouth open like a broken shutter”), and syntax remains clear. There is a mild tendency toward sustained metaphor density, especially in the middle, that flirts with purple and could benefit from a few plainer grounding lines for contrast. Still, momentum and clarity hold, and the final images land cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The combination of a lucid-dream ranger chronicler, bureaucratized dream-archives, and feral nostalgia in a mountain setting feels strikingly original. Time as a folded, non-linear sequence is not new, but the specific inflection—jealousy of past selves, future-dated birch scroll, tourists’ dreams pressing at the windows—is fresh and coherent. The ending’s insight about erasure as continuation and mapping the wheel’s spokes avoids cliché and feels earned. It stops short of radical formal innovation, but as a lyric-accumulative piece it sits comfortably in high-tier originality.</comment>
