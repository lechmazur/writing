<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrator’s grief, guilt, and compulsion to “harvest” unused potential create a rich, specific interiority, and his final decision to jump is well-motivated by the prior accumulation of self-disgust and systemic thinking. Contradictory impulses—love for his bride vs. willingness to become “death’s accountant”—are present in scene, not just summarized. The only slight limitation is that we never see a concrete, human-scale alternative he might plausibly choose now, so his arc is powerful but a bit locked into one grim channel.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: surviving the strike, being drawn to the observatory, using the geode via perturbation theory to harvest potential, realizing the moral cost, and choosing a final perturbing act with the fall that redirects a future strike. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost—he dies, and the world’s harm is slightly re-aimed. The accumulative lyricism never obscures where we are in the sequence, and the circuit-breaker/cooling constraint gives the structure a quiet, effective ticking clock.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The floating observatory, transparent floor, helium sacs, and desert below are vivid and functionally integrated, most crucially in the ending where the height and telescope alignment make his fall an actionable perturbation. The geode and telescope operate as charged micro-setting objects that focus both perception and choice. A touch more sensory breadth beyond visual and abstracted “desert wind” could deepen atmosphere, but what’s here is precise and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stakes—how he will respond to the capacity to weaponize grief and unused potential—are clear and intensify as he escalates his “hunt” from minor perturbations to systemic harvesting to self-sacrifice. His agency drives the key turns: sabotaging the observatory, accelerating collection, then choosing to die to redirect a future strike. The ethical conflict (saving lives vs. exploiting the dead) is strong, though external opposition is largely absent, keeping pressure more internal and conceptual than contested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of grief, exploitation of tragedy, and the commodification of “unused potential” are woven through concrete images—the school’s unfinished math, unadministered vaccines, unplayed requiem—rather than abstract lecture. The final realization that potential “had never left” and that he himself becomes someone else’s unlived awakening offers a resonant conceptual repricing without moralizing. A slight risk is how often the word “potential” recurs, but its uses remain specific enough to avoid feeling like a slogan.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The first-person voice is confident, coherent, and distinct, blending scientific lexicon (“perturbation theory,” “energy signatures,” “.003 degrees”) with visceral, grief-tinged imagery (“stardust that tasted like my wedding cake”). The psychic distance is well controlled, allowing both cool conceptualization and jagged emotion to coexist without slipping into authorial essaying. No POV leaks or register jolts appear, and the modulation from analytical to hallucinatory at the end feels earned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is dense and lyrical, with many images doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (e.g., geode dust tasting like wedding cake), and the rhythms vary enough to keep momentum. Metaphor is generally disciplined and on-theme, and there’s little to no scaffolding or redundancy. At times the figurative load approaches saturation, which slightly risks numbing impact, but it never quite tips into muddle or obscurity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of drone-warfare futurism, perturbation theory, and the idea of harvesting unrealized futures as a resource is striking and feels self-consistent, with a morally thorny twist on “using tragedy” that avoids cliché. The geode as a kind of second heart/accounting stone for possibilities is especially memorable, and the final act—suicide as a micro-perturbation to retarget a future strike—pays off the premise elegantly. It’s not wholly beyond any recognizable tradition of SF grief stories, but the particular configuration is fresh and bold.</comment>
