<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maris is sharply realized through her habits (reading absences like signals, logging anomalies) and embodied perceptions, and her motivation to decode the stranger’s gesture clearly drives every choice. The internal conflict—duty/curiosity versus the cost of relinquishing memories—is present but could deepen slightly in the moment of sacrifice. Her final act of releasing the Edelweiss and accepting personal memory loss reads earned by prior setup. Secondary characters are kept off-page, which is appropriate for the piece’s isolated focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The causal spine is clean: stranger’s death and the flower → investigation via “gaps” → discovery of temporal/memory loop → decision to repay by relinquishing the flower and its borrowed memories. Structure is a single, continuous scene with clear progression and one decisive turn at the balcony vision, leading to an on-page closure where the world’s asymmetries reset at visible cost. Orientation (who/where/when) is crisp from the first sentence, and the rules of the quasi-uncanny pattern are taught through repetition and then fulfilled. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a clear before/after in both reality and Maris’s internal state.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lighthouse, opal dock, mist, and sea are not just decorative; they concretely shape perception (limited visibility, sound-based awareness, gaps) and thus Maris’s investigative method and options. The Edelweiss and the lamp room function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the ending image, especially when the dock becomes a “closed eye” mirroring the resolved pattern. Sensory detail is lush yet pointed, consistently filtered through a keeper’s trained attention to light, sound, and absence. The environment’s liminal, maritime quality is inseparable from both the logic and the mood of the story.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Maris will accept or break the debt of borrowed memories—is signaled early and tightened through accumulating anomalies and the recursive apparition. Pressure escalates effectively when the stranger reappears between lamp pulses, transforming curiosity into an urgent need to alter the cycle. Her chosen tactic (sacrificing her own memories by casting away the flower) clearly forecloses a path and pays a visible price on-page. The conflict remains mostly internal and situational rather than combative, but for this lyric mode it maintains coherent tension to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images: what is remembered vs. forgotten, the ethics of keeping others’ memories, and the role of a “keeper” standing between erasure and witness. The Edelweiss and the gaps motif shift meaning—from gift to loan, from eerie absence to necessary space—reweighting earlier details at the end. The last paragraphs articulate a quiet, earned wisdom about gestures becoming their own keepers without tipping into didactic moralizing. Some thematic phrasing (“every keeper stands between what is seen and what is erased”) edges toward explicit statement but remains grounded in concrete circumstance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The close third-person POV is stable and convincing, with a distinct perceptual signature tuned to light, sound, and absence befitting a lighthouse keeper. Diction and rhythm are consistently lyrical yet purposeful, and figurative language feels like Maris’s way of thinking rather than an imposed style. Temporal and focalization control are solid; even when time blurs around the spectral recurrence, the narrative stance remains coherent. There is no head-hopping or unmotivated distance shift, and the voice modulates tension with control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is high-density and musical, with many lines doing double duty (atmosphere plus interiority or world logic), and the final images land with clarity and force. Metaphors are mostly fresh and apt (“fog hums in a bell,” “opal dock gleamed like a closed eye”), and sentence rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony. The level of lyricism is consistently elevated and flirts with overload in places, but it rarely obscures sense or momentum. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and syntax remains clean and legible even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of maritime ghost logic, memory-debt economics, and a keeper who reads “gaps” as signals feels genuinely distinctive. The Edelweiss as a conduit for alpine memories imported into a misty harbor is an unexpected, specific choice that reshapes familiar lighthouse and ghost-story tropes. The central conceptual move—that gestures and absences can accrue and be repaid like interest-bearing loans of memory—is both fresh and thematically coherent. The piece takes formal and imagistic risks (lyric density, pattern-based investigation) that heighten rather than muddy its stakes.</comment>
