<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation and interiority are clear and particular—her fixation on an “unaccounted ticket that glowed on her ledger like a wound” and her desire to thaw mistrust with transparency feel grounded. The moment of overhearing Rico and Jun shows credible conflicting impulses (confrontation vs. accepting the offered absolution) and the final choice to keep the story within the walls is earned. Secondary characters are thinner but functional as catalysts rather than rounded figures. Emotional change is believable, though the reconciliation edges toward tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: stray ticket → investigation in the booth → eavesdropping → retrieval of lens → public screening as resolution. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mira shifts from frozen mistrust to chosen, bounded trust with an on-page cost (keeping the prank private while releasing resentment). Structure is linear and contained, with no orientation issues and no dropped setups (the missing lens report pays off well). The main limitation is that external stakes (job loss, institutional fallout) remain mostly implied, keeping the structure elegant but modest in scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The “crystal whispering forecourt after rain” and dust-filled projection booth are vivid, sensorial, and consistently filtered through Mira’s attention. Setting is not mere backdrop: the rain-streaked pillars serving as a projection surface and the dawn “unbuttoning the sky” at the end charge the final images. The obsolete projector and missing lens function as concrete anchors tying environment to conflict and theme. While the physical space does not heavily constrain physical options, it meaningfully shapes atmosphere and the mode of resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether mistrust among staff will remain frozen or be thawed—is clear and tracked through the ticket, the missing lens, and the overheard conversation. Pressure coherently tightens when Mira has to choose between public confrontation and a more merciful, symbolic act via the film projection. Escalation is mostly internal and quiet, so the emotional cost is felt but not jagged; the conflict resolves without serious risk of material loss on the page. The result is satisfying but a little gentle for top-tier pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of secrecy, honesty, and collective memory are well integrated, especially via the doodle motifs (key, cracked lens, sewn mouth, open lock) and the silent film of “Staff Memories” as a nonverbal apology. The idea that honesty can be both exposing and protective is dramatized rather than merely asserted, with Mira choosing a form of truth-telling that stays inside the walls. However, lines like “secrecy had imprisoned them, honesty would free them” lean into explicit moralizing instead of trusting subtext. The ending still leaves a resonant emotional aftereffect rooted in concrete images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The third-person-limited voice tied to Mira is consistent and confident, with a strong sensory and metaphorical texture (“listening to snow fall upward,” “her voice soft as wet gravel”). Dialogue is sparse but natural, and the shift from lyrical narration to simple spoken lines at the end is effective. The narrative lexicon occasionally skirts the edge of writerly flourish, yet overall remains coherent with the contemplative, nocturnal register. There’s a distinct perceptual signature without POV leakage or mechanical scaffolding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and do multiple jobs, and the story sustains an appealing, controlled lyricism. Images like the ticket “glowed on her ledger like a wound” and the forecourt feeling “larger, as though the rain had washed the walls farther apart” are striking without obscuring sense. There is some accumulation of metaphors (“funeral march for resentment,” “ambiguously clear weight of trust”) that nudge toward purple but do not derail clarity or momentum. No obvious loops or scaffolding clutter the prose, and rhythm tracks the scene’s emotional arc.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The combination of an archival staff-memory reel used as apology, a hidden lens, and cryptic doodles as a moral scavenger hunt feels fresh and distinctive. The “resonant hush” of the concert hall and the silent film as a vehicle for confession give a non-obvious angle on reconciliation. The core moral terrain (honesty vs. secrecy, trust in a workplace) is familiar, but it’s filtered through specific, idiosyncratic details that would be hard to swap into another setting unchanged. The ingenuity is solid rather than radical, more quietly inventive than risk-taking.</comment>
