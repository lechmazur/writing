<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The carver is specific and textured—a meditative artisan whose vocation plausibly shapes how she engages with grief and the uncanny. Her motivation (to understand the village’s grief) is clear and continuous, and her ultimate reorientation of her craft feels earned. However, internal conflict remains relatively abstract; she moves from seeking to understanding with little on-page struggle or contradiction beyond summarized “weight.” The climactic acceptance inside the chrysalis leans toward declarative realization rather than dramatized, messy ambivalence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The accumulative structure is coherent: arrival → following the monarch → discovering poem-chrysalises → hidden headstones → chrysalis and reorientation form a legible progression. Causality is soft but present—the butterfly and grandmother’s mentorship clearly motivate each next discovery. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: grief shifts from something carved in stone to an ongoing transformation, with a clear before/after in her role. The main weakness is a slight sense of over-explained insight in the final third, which flattens some structural surprise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse, storms, glass, terracotta, and the oak piercing the ceiling are vivid and thematically charged, not mere backdrop. The environment meaningfully shapes what can happen—hidden headstones wrapped in roots, chrysalises on watering cans, and the contained-yet-porous space make the chrysalis scene and the unplaced graves possible. Detail selection generally feels filtered through the carver’s sensibility (stone, tools, inscriptions) and the grief-poetry motif. A minor limitation is occasional piling of images without new functional work, but the setting clearly charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding and reshaping collective grief—is clear, and pressure accumulates via increasingly uncanny discoveries culminating in the personal chrysalis. Escalation is more textural than conflictual; the story tightens emotionally but rarely forces the carver into hard, mutually exclusive choices. Her agency is present (choosing to follow, to sit, to feel, to reframe her work), yet the path feels guided more by revelation than by contested decisions. The cost—finally letting herself feel and altering her vocational purpose—is real but presented gently, with limited friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of grief, memorialization, and transformation are woven through concrete particulars—poem-shrouds, ribbon patterns, unplaced headstones, and butterflies as carriers of unsaid sorrow. The final understanding that memorials should be spaces for ongoing transformation rather than endpoints is resonant and fits the imagery. However, several lines state the theme outright (“it wasn’t a stone to be carved, but a transformation to be undergone”; “not stones that marked where grief ended”) which edges toward didactic, reducing subtextual richness. The piece invites reflection but could trust implication more.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The third-person voice is stable, lyrically inclined, and well-matched to the carver’s contemplative temperament and the story’s spectral mood. Diction and syntax show deliberate rhythm, with recurring phrases (“thundering calm,” dinner poems) creating an incantatory effect consistent with the premise. POV control is clean—no head-hopping—and the omniscient-leaning access to village customs feels framed through her knowledge. At times, the lyric register risks monotony because emotional peaks sound similar to quieter moments, but overall voice control is strong.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose is generally elegant and information-dense, weaving atmosphere, theme, and action in most sentences. Repetition of certain constructions and phrases (“each poem traded at dinner,” explicit thematic restatements) creates a mild sense of looped emphasis that could be tightened. A few lines veer into explanatory abstraction rather than image-driven feeling, dulling momentum in the back half. Still, there are no serious clarity errors, and many images (poem-shrouded chrysalises, poem-titled headstones) are striking and cleanly rendered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a gravestone carver, spectral butterflies as ancestral mentors, poem-trading as a grief custom, and an overgrown greenhouse of unplaced graves feels fresh and memorable. The central metaphor of grief as metamorphosis rather than inscription is conceptually strong and followed through in concrete ways (ribbon patterns on wings, chrysalis enclosure, poem-headstones). Referencing famous poems risks familiarity but is recontextualized as communal ritual rather than mere quotation. The piece takes genuine aesthetic risks in its lyric-ritual mode while retaining coherence.</comment>
