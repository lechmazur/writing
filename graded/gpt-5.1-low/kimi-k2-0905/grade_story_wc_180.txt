<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The mender’s motivation (honoring a breached contract, keeping the orchard alive, protecting her daughter’s future) is vivid and consistent, and her choices—opening the forbidden pouch, barring the elders—feel rooted in that drive. Interiority is particular (“deciduous vows,” coconut oil and playground dust) and embodied through craft rather than labels. However, her internal conflict is relatively low-friction; she rarely seems genuinely torn so much as righteously determined, which slightly softens the sense of cost. The daughter’s brief on-page presence is effective but remains more emblematic than deeply individuated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The causal chain from breached contract to forbidden-bag ritual to orchard revival to generational handoff is clean and legible, with each step motivated by the previous one. Time jumps (“Years later…”) are handled as purposeful summary rather than hand-waving, and the closure beat—older mender satisfied beneath the graft—reads as a resonant reconfiguration with the cost of aging and relinquishment on the page. The global drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal spine with accumulative, pattern-rich texture), and that lens holds to the end. A slightly sharper testing moment for failure—something the repair might plausibly not work—would raise the stakes of the structural arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard is richly rendered (“figs… drip from rafters,” “branches wove tracery finer than any mason’s dream”) and continuously interacts with action—climbing scaffolds, grafting beams, sleeping under the graft, petals snowing through the nave. Environment constrains and enables choices (needing to climb high, using corbels and rafters as living scaffolding) and directly charges the final image of the older mender beneath the grafted beam. The setting’s logic (fruit bearing scrolls of vows, pollen-infused ribbon scenting the city) remains consistent within the piece’s fabulist rules. A few fewer decorative flourishes would make the functional constraints of the space stand out even more.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether and how the mender will repair the orchard after institutional betrayal—is clear and tightened when she must act without the council, using her mother’s risky teachings and personal relics. The key escalation is her refusal of the elders’ amended contracts, which forecloses an easy reconciliation and locks in a path of costly independence. Internal and external conflicts (resentment vs care, contract vs apology) are braided, but the resistance she faces is largely conceptual; there’s little concrete pushback or risk to her body or child once the ritual succeeds. As a result, tension is strong but not quite knife-edge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of contract vs living promise, apology as nourishment, and generational wisdom composting into stronger roots emerge organically from the orchard’s behavior and the mother–daughter arc. Recurring images (deciduous vows, ribbon, copper and coconut scent) are reweighted by the ending, which conceptually reprices “broken contracts” as potential fertilizer for hope. Some thematic statements verge on overt thesis (“bridging generational wisdom requires no gold…”), nudging toward didacticism even though they remain character-grounded. The emotional aftereffect is resonant and specific, but a touch more reliance on image over articulated insight would deepen it further.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The third-person voice has a distinct, confident texture—densely metaphorical yet controlled, with coinages like “deciduous vows” and “accidental wisdom” that feel native to this character’s worldview. Psychic distance stays steady, giving us close access filtered through the mender’s craft and history without head-hopping. Rhythm modulates well between lush descriptive sweeps and tighter action beats (opening the pouch, knotting the ribbon, barring the elders). Occasionally the lyrical register flirts with over-saturation, but the pattern is taught early and sustained, so it reads intentional rather than uncontrolled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The line-level craft is strong: sentences multitask, imagery is often striking, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. The prose maintains momentum despite its lyric density, with transitions (“Word spread…”, “Years later…”) that efficiently carry us through time. Metaphoric richness is nearly continuous, which risks purple prose but generally remains coherent and in-voice; the text stops short of mixed-metaphor muddle. A bit more sparseness at peak beats (e.g., the first ritual, the elders’ arrival) could let the most powerful images hit even harder.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of contract law with a living cathedral-orchard whose fruit contains preserved vows is a fresh, memorable conceit, and “fruit feeds on apology” is an arresting reframe of civic obligation. The quartz-eye mender, forgotten-bag magic, and deciduous promises synthesize into a world that feels idiosyncratic rather than templated. The generational handoff and ribbon’s decay avoid cliché by tying emotional truth (inheritance, repair, forgiveness) to these specific, peculiar mechanics. It could push further into unexpected moral ambiguity—for example, giving the elders a more complex case—but as is, it already feels distinctive and publication-ready.</comment>
