<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The summoner’s motives and history are clear and specific—his wandering to “collect hush” and his master’s mind cracked by code give him depth and plausibility. His final choice to swallow the hush sphere registers as a felt cost and an earned extension of his vocation. However, his interiority leans more emblematic than conflicted; we see little in the way of contradictory impulses or real temptation to refuse the burden. That lack of visible inner friction keeps him slightly shy of the most demanding literary characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The causal spine is clean: ritual preparation → mapping silence → cranes/sigil → prophecy fights back → counterword → swallowing the sphere, with each move flowing logically. Backstory is economically tied to the present and sharpens the stakes of the current ritual. Closure lands solidly: the world is measurably altered (prophecy hushed, birdsong freed) and the cost persists inside his chest. The lens feels hybrid (ritual-causal plus accumulative imagery), but it holds without ambiguity through the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The brook and nocturnal haven are vividly rendered and consistently functional: the water accepts offerings, mirrors generate cranes, and the flow shapes his path and the final images. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—moonlight, reeds, frog throats—always filtered through his ritual focus on silence and code. The setting constrains action (he steps into the cold water, follows the brook downstream) and charges the final cadence as the brook “sang without code.” This is a strong case of environment as both stage and active participant in the story’s logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—hushing a dangerous prophecy infiltrating dreams—is established early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates when the prophecy actively “fights back” via cricket-encoded drumbeats, forcing him deeper into ritual and culminating in the risky internalization of the hush sphere. The cost is conceptually clear but the struggle itself feels slightly too smooth; he never seems in serious danger of failing or doubting his path. That small softness in felt jeopardy keeps the escalation strong rather than searing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from action: silence as an active craft, the ethics of shouldering collective nightmares, tranquility as “mastery of…blaze” rather than absence. Recurring images—cranes, code, hush, brook—shift meaning by the end, reweighting quiet from passive to sacrificial. The line spelling out the thesis (“tranquility is not the absence of fire but the mastery of its blaze”) tips toward aphoristic explicitness and slightly blunts the otherwise excellent subtext. Still, the story achieves a resonant, non-didactic answer to its central question through the final images of mapped silence and enduring burden.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with patterned metaphors (“terrestrially cosmic,” “smoothed hush”) forming a recognizable idiom rather than random ornament. Close third-person focalization is steady; we never slip out of his experiential filter even as the narration grows mythic. Rhythmic control is strong—sentences lengthen for incantatory effect and tighten around crucial actions like speaking the “.” and swallowing the sphere. A few turns of phrase skirt the edge of self-conscious flourish, but they don’t break the coherence of the narrative stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is rich and dense, with many lines doing double duty for image and theme, and the rhythm supports the ritualistic mood. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent and grounded in the story’s established metaphoric lexicon (code, silence, celestial/mud imagery). There is mild purple-prose risk and a few near-redundancies of motif, yet clarity and momentum remain intact through the climax and closure. With a bit of pruning for repetition, this could reach a rarer level of line-level precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements—a summoner who maps silence, prophecy as executable code in nature, an uttered period as counterspell, hush folded into origami cranes—is strikingly original. The story fully commits to its conceit and follows through to a logically and thematically satisfying end image (a private galaxy of hush rotating in his chest). Risks in diction and concept mostly pay off, yielding a piece that feels singular rather than derivative. Minor overtness in thematic statement is the only thing keeping it from an even higher band.</comment>
