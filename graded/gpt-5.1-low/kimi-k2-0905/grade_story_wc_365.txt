<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sensory map maker is sharply etched through her embodied perceptions and vocation, and her final decision to “chart not places but consequences” feels earned from the accumulated beats of longing, curiosity, and guilt. Her grief over the lover and dawning sense of complicity are specific rather than generic. Internal contradiction—her simultaneous urge to reach the younger self and the shard’s violent correction of that urge—adds tension. The only slight weakness is that the revelation of her role in the cover-up is delivered quickly in exposition rather than being more gradually dramatized through her reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The accumulative structure is coherent: shard activation → loom of bays → locker discovery → truth revelation → new vow, with each because/therefore linkage clear under a lyric frame. The closure unit is strong: she redefines her mapping practice in direct response to discovered complicity, with visible cost. The multiverse “bays” are variations on a single charged site, so the mosaic remains unified rather than diffuse. The conspiracy explanation (“maps, sold to distant militaries, funded the cover-up”) verges on compressed info-dump but does not break causality or closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport repair bay and its parallel variants are vivid, tactile, and consistently filtered through her sensory-professional bias (temperature, vibration, scent). The environment directly constrains choices—the shard pulls her along decks and thresholds, the zero-g bay forces bracing boots, the specific locker in this bay anchors the emotional climax. The recurring bay at dawn, “exhaling” into the shape of a question, clearly charges the final image. There is rich atmosphere without sliding into static postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unearthing the withheld truth about her lover and what her gift has enabled—is clear and escalates from abstract itch to existential reckoning. Pressure deepens as each bay reveals more personal consequence, culminating in the locker and data cube, then spikes again when she realizes her complicity. Her final decision to weaponize her maps against secrecy rather than for militaries reads as an earned renunciation with cost: she can no longer be innocent or comfortably complicit. The conflict remains largely internal, but internal and external pressures are well braided.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme coheres around truth as weight, complicity, and the ethics of perception: the line “Truth is the mass of what you still carry after the universe forgets you” elegantly crystallizes what the narrative has been enacting. The green shard, loom, and “redirect” motif all reappear at the end with reweighted meaning, shifting from cool SF gadgetry to moral instrument. Her choice to map “consequences” rather than spaces provides a non-literal, resonant answer to the story’s central question. The one mild drawback is that thematic language edges toward explicit statement, though it remains mostly earned and image-driven.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in tactile and sonic detail befitting a sensory cartographer. Lyric density and recurring diction (“weave,” “redirect,” “cyclically spontaneous”) form an intentional pattern rather than haze. The narrative never oversteps her plausible knowledge; revelations arrive with her. There is no head-hopping, and the modulation from dreamy to charged to resolute reads controlled rather than melodramatic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is high-level: sentences are varied, information-dense, and typically do two or three jobs at once (worldbuilding, emotion, theme). Metaphoric motifs (loom, threads, mass, vibration) are coherent rather than mixed, and they intensify toward the end. There is some risk of saturation—nearly every line is figurative—but the rhythm and clarity hold, and there are no evident scaffold or synonym loops. Line-level craft supports momentum instead of stalling it, particularly around the locker and note sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a “sensory map maker,” a humming glass shard, and a multiverse repair bay functioning as a loom of possible worlds feels striking and non-obvious. The twist that her maps underwrote a militarized cover-up, and her decision to redirect her skill toward exposing buried truths, grounds the conceptual ingenuity in moral stakes. Recurring motifs like “redirect” and “cyclically spontaneous” are used inventively rather than as mere quirks. The piece reads as a distinctive vision that could sit comfortably in a top-tier speculative venue with minimal revision.</comment>
