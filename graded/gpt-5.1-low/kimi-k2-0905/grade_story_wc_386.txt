<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marrow’s vocation, methods, and restraint around truth are vivid and consistent, and her motive to “salvage something pure” feels organically tied to who she is. Interiority is conveyed more through externalized images than contradictory impulses under pressure, so we rarely see her torn or degraded by stress. Her final stance—carrying the “pure thing” forward while leaving the mirror—is coherent but not heavily costed on the page. Strong character concept and texture, slightly underdramatized internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural structure is clear: dream → shrine investigation → descent through glacier memories → retrieval and resurfacing → reflective coda, with each step logically following the last. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the pure snow globe reconfigures wreckage as a cradle for light, and her future role is glimpsed. The causal throughline is intact, though obstacles are fairly yielding and the price of success is more implied than dramatized. Orientation is firm from the opening, and the pattern (lyric progression with recurring objects) is taught and maintained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting work is superb: glacier, wreck, shrine, and ice corridors are sensorially specific and filtered through Marrow’s watery, liminal sensibility. Environment and objects (glacier pressure, air pockets, snow globes) actively shape what is possible, including the crack that opens the path and the closing windows at the end. The recurring snow globe/shrine miniatures charge the final images, and weather/light (“borrowed starlight,” crevasse-blue) tonally fuse with theme. The world’s rules feel consistent and are learned through her exploration rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The central stake—salvaging something pure before the glacier digests the passengers—is clear, and there is one solid tightening when the glacier cracks the shrine to reveal the corridor, followed by the sealing “windows of connection” as she leaves. However, resistance is minimal: the glacier accedes after a single silent negotiation, and Marrow encounters little genuine risk or failure on the way to the core. Internal stakes (risk of being overwhelmed by others’ memories) are suggested but never forced to a sharp choice. As a result, tension feels more eerie than urgent, effective but not maximally sharp.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of interconnection, memory as shared infrastructure, and “wreckage cradling light” emerge organically from the imagery of windows, cameos, and the twin snow globes. The final realization—carrying the pure knowledge forward and teaching others—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of what to do with collective sorrow. A few lines verge on explicit moralizing (“the pure thing—the knowledge that even wreckage can cradle light—”), slightly reducing the obliqueness. Overall, the piece sustains a complex, humane meditation without collapsing into sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The third-person-limited voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“borrowed starlight,” “memory leaks from one soul to another”) that feels tailored to Marrow’s profession and world. Rhythm and syntax vary well, giving the prose a distinctive music without sacrificing clarity. The narrative distance remains stable, and any omniscient-leaning flourishes read as part of a controlled, mythic register rather than POV slippage. It’s a high-literary voice that would sit comfortably in a prestige venue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The line-level work is dense and polished: metaphors are inventive yet generally coherent, and sentences often carry multiple layers of information (world, mood, theme) without obvious padding. There is some risk of purple prose given the constant figurative texture, but cadence and image choice mostly justify the lushness. Repetition feels intentional rather than scaffolded, and there are no obvious loops or syntactic templates dragging momentum. The final images in particular are clean and potent, free of muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a wreck-diver ghost whisperer, glacier-entombed liner, dream cameos, and physically manifest “windows of connection” feels genuinely fresh. Recurring objects (melted and pure snow globes, ice mirror) and the notion of the glacier “digesting” passengers give the story a singular mythic-psychological texture. The closure—recasting hauntings and wreckage as sites of luminous connection and future rescue—reconfigures familiar ghost-story tropes in a non-obvious way. It reads as a distinct artistic vision rather than a recombination of stock genre parts.</comment>
