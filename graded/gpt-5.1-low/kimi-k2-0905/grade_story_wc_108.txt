<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Leo’s phobic, hyper-competent stunt-double identity is sharply realized, and his fear/need for validation drives every micro-choice from kneeling by the girl to staging the projection. The internal contradiction—terrified of audiences yet performing for them—feels specific and embodied (“counting heartbeats like stunt beats”). His final decision to weaponize his trembling rather than erase it is fully earned by prior beats. The relationship with the absent tyrant-director and the fleeting girl both sharpen his motivations without crowding the frame.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: DNA revelation → quest for the shell → clue from the cast → retrieval of the shell → guards’ arrival → projector gambit → decision to leak the footage. The drive lens is primarily causal with thematic overtones, and closure lands as a decisive change plus conceptual repricing when Leo chooses to release the uncut reel. Cost is legible: he risks his remaining career and confirms himself as “coward” on film to gain narrative autonomy. Structure is tight within one night’s arc; no orientation or lens ambiguity issues.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The “rusted library under the stars” is vivid and consistently exploited—iron stacks, drainage alcove, projector, and perforated roof all shape tactics and imagery. The environment constrains the shell’s hiding place and enables the critical move of projecting his raw fear onto the ceiling. Details feel filtered through a stunt-world eye (shelves like a “prop ship,” stars like “unpaid extras”), deepening mood without becoming a static backdrop. The setting charges the final image of stars and trembling footage but stops just short of a 9-band leap in sheer environmental inevitability.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early—without proof of being more than “expendable muscle,” his identity and livelihood vanish when digital doubles replace him. Pressure escalates from internal dread and search tension to the concrete arrival of guards, forcing Leo to choose between flight and an exposed, improvisational stand. His projector outwitting is a meaningful tightening: he leverages his fear rather than suppressing it, which forecloses the option of remaining safely invisible. The cost and trade-off are visible, though we only glimpse the consequences prospectively (“tomorrow I would leak…”).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of authorship, exploitation, and vulnerability-as-power arise organically from the film-industry frame and the mother’s recorded advice, then reconfigure in the decision to keep “the take where your knees shake.” The shell’s message, the phrase “betray the frame,” and the projection of unedited fear create strong subtext about resisting curated narratives. However, the closing lines tip into explicit thesis (“Vulnerability isn’t armor; it’s the power source, the live wire”), slightly flattening what the scenes and images already earned. Despite this on-the-nose note, the emotional and conceptual resonance remains substantial.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The first-person voice is confident, textured, and consistently colored by stunt and film metaphors (“call for places,” “family brand,” “edited lie surrounding every shot”). POV is steady and plausibly limited; reflection is anchored in present stimuli and doesn’t float into abstract essaying. Dialogue is minimal but effective, especially the girl’s line “Only to people who listen scared,” which deepens theme without over-explaining. Rhythm and diction modulate with pressure, balancing lyric flourish and clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: images do multiple jobs, syntax varies, and most sentences carry both atmosphere and character. Metaphor density is high but generally controlled and coherent with the cinematic milieu; a few phrases (“dawn bruised the horizon,” “constellations clogged”) verge on familiar or lush yet do not impede clarity. There are no noticeable loops or scaffolding sentences, and the closure image (stars as “unpaid extras” watching his fear) reads clean. Slight purple-fringe moments keep it just under the 9-band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—a phobic stunt double reclaiming authorship via archival magic-object, industrial betrayal, and an ethic of visible fear—feels fresh and specific rather than template. The industry jargon, the rusted library as quasi-archive of erased narratives, and the seashell carrying a single “unedited” sentence are imaginative and integrated. The move from being edited by others to “betraying the frame” himself is a non-obvious yet inevitable-feeling turn. Overall, it’s a distinctive take on identity, inheritance, and spectacle that risks strangeness without losing coherence.</comment>
