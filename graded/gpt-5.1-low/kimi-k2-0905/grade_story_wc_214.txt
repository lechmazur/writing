<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The janitor’s interiority is specific, embodied, and consistent, with clear motivation rooted in grief and reverence for the sky (“for the planet that had forgotten how to look up”). His spiritual curiosity directly drives his actions—talking to meteors, touching the ember—and culminates in a credible change when he relinquishes the lantern and leaves. Contradictory impulses (custodian of silence vs. yearning for connection) are present but could be dramatized more sharply under pressure rather than mostly described. Still, the final renunciation feels earned and carries a legible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural structure is tight: his nightly routine with the lantern → anomalous lingering reflections → dialog with meteors → embedded fleck → cosmic vision → decision to leave. Each beat follows naturally and deepens the central drive toward understanding vulnerability, with no orientation debt. Closure lands cleanly via a resonant reconfiguration: his stance toward strength, burning, and openness is reweighted, and the observatory’s later state reflects that change with conceptual and emotional cost. The brief time jump to “years later” reinforces the closure rather than feeling like a bolt-on epilogue.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly realized and integral: the “shooting star tracking station,” brass instruments, dome, and telescope all shape what he can do and how he changes (his job, his ritual, his final act of leaving lenses open). The yellow lantern glass functions as both object and micro-setting, constraining perception and enabling the key vision sequence. Environmental details mirror and deepen interior states without feeling ornamental (dust motes as miniature galaxies, the hush of the overlooked era). The final afterimages on glass surfaces show setting directly charging the last image and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The stakes are primarily internal—can he reconcile fragility and strength—and they escalate through concrete turns: the lingering reflections, the lantern brightening, the pulsing fleck, the cosmic vision, then the question about burning vs. changing. His choice to touch the ember and later to abandon the lantern and job are meaningful acts that foreclose paths and carry cost. Pressure is more contemplative than oppositional, but within an accumulative lens it tightens convincingly toward the meteor’s ethical question. A slightly clearer sense of what he risks in leaving the observatory physically would sharpen the stakes further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The central thematic question—whether vulnerability is weakness or a necessary condition for transformation—is woven through concrete images and actions rather than stated abstractly, culminating in the line about strength as “atmosphere” that lets light bruise you. The meteor’s nonverbal question and his reaction ground the philosophy in specific experience, and the final image of the lingering yellow heart-prints extends the theme socially to “the rest of us.” There is no moralizing; ambiguity remains around what is lost and gained by his openness. The theme feels inseparable from the character’s arc and the story’s core metaphors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The third-person close voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (cosmic-scale metaphors, gentle irony around “hired—though no one remembered posting the job”). Rhythm is well-controlled, mixing long, sinuous sentences with strategically shorter beats at key turns (e.g., “He wept then…”). The diction suits the quasi-mythic tone and never drifts into jarring registers. At times the lyricism approaches density that could risk over-saturation, but it remains legible and purposeful throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is rich and image-dense, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“dust motes drifted like miniature galaxies”). Sentences generally advance mood or meaning without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops; the story moves forward smoothly even during reflective passages. Some metaphoric stacking (“ribbon of starlight stretching backward through every cataclysm”) verges on purple but doesn’t quite tip into muddle or redundancy. Minor tightening could heighten impact, but line-level craft is already at a high literary standard.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The fusion of “cosmic janitor,” meteor empathy, and a lantern that stores star-sighs feels genuinely fresh, not like a recombination of standard genre tropes. The overlooked era, flourishing stillness, and reinterpretation of burning as joyous transformation give a non-obvious angle on apocalypse/aftermath and cosmic awe. The meteor’s question and the image of an observatory prepared as a welcoming committee for falling stars show bold, specific imaginative choices that feel inevitable in hindsight. Overall, premise, imagery, and emotional logic cohere into a singular, memorable vision.</comment>
