<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s reluctance, competence, and trapped compassion come through clearly in her actions (the warmth-ghosts, the nut, her refusal to turn toward the orchard). Motivation is clean and consistent: she hates the orchard but is compelled to save strangers. Internal contradiction is present but mostly implied rather than deeply dramatized in on-page turmoil. The Earned Stasis of returning to her prison reads emotionally credible and grounded in prior beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight: curse/orchard → travelers in maze → ticking frost clock → birds’ threat → blueprint nut → warmth-impressions → final fork decision → safe exit vs renewed imprisonment. Single-scene structure with a clear time pressure supports a satisfying closure where the dominant stake (saving them before frost) is resolved at a cost. The closure image of fossilized handprints and the walk back to the orchard delivers a strong Resonant Reconfiguration without loose threads. There are no orientation issues or contrived late abilities; rules are established before they matter.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, frost, and orchard are vividly rendered and consistently govern what Mara can and cannot do. Environment and objects (stones that trigger birds, the cliff edge, frost, the orchard’s pull) directly constrain choices and shape tactics. Sensory detail (frost-brittle grass, sap with faces, birds’ brass wings) is selective and purposeful rather than touristic. The final image—handprints sealed in frost, birds folding wings, orchard stirring—charges the setting with lasting emotional and conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The primary stake—get the travelers out before frost or they die—is clearly signaled and escalated through the birds’ patrol, the seven-lie junction, and the visible onset of frost. Mara’s agency drives the turns: using her weight-impressions, then escalating to the nut’s blueprint and glowing handprint at the final fork. External pressure (time, birds, curse) and internal pressure (reluctant duty, hatred of orchard) are coherently braided, even if the inner moral calculus remains mostly subtextual. The cost is legible: each rescue deepens her own ongoing imprisonment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of constrained mercy, thankless duty, and “graceless beauty” emerge organically from Mara’s repeated, costly rescues within a system that will never free her. The cursed orchard, fossilized handprints, and mechanical birds all contribute to a meditation on being an unseen caretaker of others’ survival. There is no moralizing; the ending’s charged stasis invites reflection on the value and burden of saving strangers. Ambiguity about whether this cycle offers meaning or just perpetuates her captivity keeps the piece thematically alive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is confident, lyrically precise, and stable in distance, with a clear perceptual signature in how Mara notices mechanics, cold, and constraint. Syntax and rhythm vary effectively, tightening around moments of threat (the bird’s approach, the final fork) and relaxing slightly for reflection without stalling. Diction fits the world and character, leaning elevated but not implausibly so for the mode. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative certainty stays within what Mara can infer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without padding. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent (“wings folding like prayers nobody taught them,” “frost…like tiny white nooses”) and rarely feels overwrought. There is minimal redundancy or scaffolding; rhythm and paragraphing sustain momentum right through closure. I see no loops or artifacts that obscure sense or dull the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of a cursed orchard, mechanical birds, warmth-ghost guidance, and a nut-blueprint is strikingly fresh and integrated rather than gimmicky. The emotional arc—a bound caretaker performing anonymous rescues at personal cost—is familiar but sharpened by these specific, imaginative mechanics. The final cadence (prayers “nobody taught [the birds],” crystal fossils of her handprints, and her trudging back to the trees she hates) feels both inevitable and non-obvious. It reads as a distinctive vision that would stand out even in a crowded submission pool.</comment>
