<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mila’s vocation, perceptions, and choices are specific and coherent, and her shift from “noticer” to active cultivator of memory feels earned. Her interiority is mostly shown through sensory attention and metaphor rather than abstract labels, which works for this lyrical mode. The gardener is lightly sketched but functionally strong, applying direct pressure via the “plant it” instruction and the warning about scrutiny. The main limitation is that Mila’s internal conflict (fear of sealing amnesia vs temptation to use/eat the bread) stays more implied than dramatized in distinct, contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/textural lens: discovery of the impossible loaf → refusal to eat → alliance with the gardener → guerrilla planting → recall/uncloaking → reopened bakery and reframed understanding. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: the sacred was continuous, and her stance toward ordinary bread (and her own role) has changed with palpable emotional cost. The drive is thematic rather than plot-twisty, but stakes around urban forgetting and guilt remain coherent. A slightly sharper on-page dilemma or concrete setback in the middle would deepen structural pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The city, Rue des Aubes, the gutted bakery, and especially the overgrown palace courtyard and tea house are vividly realized and tightly filtered through Mila’s noticing mind. Setting repeatedly constrains and charges choices: vanished shops and “Remodeling” signs define the threat, asphalt scars dictate where they plant, and the palace mosaics literally “uncloak” history at the climax. The recurring physicality of bread, soil, vines, and herbs grounds the more abstract stakes. A minor limitation is that the broader city’s social texture remains a bit impressionistic, though commuters and guilds provide a hint of lived-in world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—resisting the city’s slide into amnesiac normality and finding a non-destructive way to handle the miraculous loaf—is clear and tight. Escalation is gentle but real: from discovery and potential misuse of the bread to a citywide guerrilla pattern, then to visible spatial and artistic “uncloaking,” culminating in the risk of ordinary life reabsorbing the miracle (normal bread returning) and her choosing to read that as revelation instead of loss. The cost is largely emotional and conceptual—her tears at ordinary bread, acceptance that sacredness was never missing—but that cost is legible. The conflict could benefit from one more concrete, resisting force (social, institutional, or magical) testing her tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of memory vs erasure, guilt and absolution, and the sacredness of the ordinary are woven through object (bread), method (gardening), and setting (ruins that refuse to forget) rather than bolted on. The line “bread is daily resurrection, and absolution is not granted but cultivated like thyme between cobblestones” effectively crystallizes the thematic core and is well-earned by prior beats. The ending’s image of every doorway as a possible altar and commuters as “potential gardeners” offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central question. A few formulations border on direct statement and slightly reduce ambiguity, but they stop short of sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The third-person-limited voice has a distinct, controlled lyrical texture—phrases like “heuristically gentle” and “flour ghosts” feel idiosyncratic but coherent with Mila’s perceptual style. POV is stable, with no head-hopping, and the gardener’s brief dialogue is concise, charged, and tonally aligned (“Guilt rises like yeast; plant it”). Rhythm and diction modulate well between atmospheric description and key realizations, maintaining legibility despite high figurative density. The piece teaches its slightly heightened register early, so later flourishes read as intentional rather than overreach.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is polished, with strong information density—most sentences carry character, atmosphere, and theme at once, and there is little scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Metaphors are fresh and controlled (“roses grew through mosaic gods,” “tiny green shoots wearing flakes of crust like name tags”) and rarely mix or blur sense. Rhythm varies well across long, sinuous lines and tighter cadences at key turns (e.g., the first frost, touching the mosaics, tasting ordinary bread), giving the piece momentum despite its reflective bent. A few abstractions (“absolution felt tenuous”) lean on concept language rather than image, but they don’t significantly dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The core conceit—a professional “creeping normality noticer” using a miraculous loaf and guerrilla gardening to fight urban amnesia and cultivate sacred ordinariness—is strikingly original and coherently pursued. Bread-as-resurrective memory, “Remodeling” signs that never come down, and herbs spelling old shop names in basil and marjoram feel specific and non-template. The palace tea house and the gardener’s role ground the magic in a quiet, resistant community rather than a pat allegory. It stops just short of the very highest band because its thematic register (sacred/ordinary, guilt/absolution) is familiar, though executed with unusual freshness.</comment>
