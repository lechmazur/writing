<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mourner’s motivation and arc—from obsessive preservation toward acceptance—are clear and consistent, with her craft and micro-choices (where she places each figure, choosing to leave) rooted in grief. However, her interiority trends toward summarized insight rather than embodied contradiction; we’re told her lesson more than we feel her warring impulses on the page. The decade of solitude and “rock bottom” are efficient but also convenient shorthand that avoid dramatizing struggle. The final renunciation (leaving the observatory) is earned but could carry more visceral cost if her reluctance or resistance surfaced in-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The structure is cleanly accumulative: she creates and places origami in successive locations, each deepening the conceptual map, culminating in folding the stencil and choosing to depart. Causality is coherent—daughter’s coordinates → observatory → decade of work → origami method → decision to leave—and the observatory’s rules stay stable. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she shifts from preserving the dead to celebrating through change, with a clear before/after in her stance. The main limitation is that most turns are reflective rather than dramatized under fresh pressure, so escalation feels smooth rather than sharply tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The observatory, curtains of intention, and celestial mechanisms form a vivid, specific environment that feels integral rather than decorative. Details like water “extracted from the curtains of intention” and star-tracking orreries are filtered through her craft-minded gaze and directly enable her final act. The setting meaningfully charges the ending image—the glowing curtains and constellation of paper figures reconfigure the space as a guide for future souls. A slight excess of conceptual nouns over tactile sensation is the only thing keeping this from an even higher band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether she remains frozen in grief or accepts transformation and returns to the living—is legible from early on. Pressure deepens as she repurposes each coordinate-bearing figure, culminating in dissolving the stencil and fixing a coordinate for her own departure, which forecloses the option of staying with her daughter’s echo. The cost is conceptually strong but emotionally underplayed; we don’t see her nearly choose to stay or visibly falter. As a result, the conflict feels meaningful yet somewhat pre-resolved, with limited sense of risk at the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of grief, memorialization, and withering-as-prelude-to-blooming are organically tied to the jewelry, observatory, and origami motifs. However, the story repeatedly states its thesis outright—“The genuinely artificial nature of her jewelry had always been its truth,” “that we teach the dead to bloom again by allowing ourselves to change”—veering toward essayistic moralizing. This reduces subtext and robs some images of their chance to carry meaning silently. Resonance is still present, but the ending feels explained rather than discovered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the liminal, ritualistic action, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in her craft and grief. Sentence rhythm is varied, and the diction knits the metaphysical and the tactile without obvious register clashes. While the narration sometimes slides into generalized abstraction, it remains within a plausible elevated literary register rather than feeling like authorial intrusion from another voice. There is no dialogue to test, but the narrative stance alone carries the piece with confidence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose is polished, syntactically varied, and often evocative, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. There is some tendency toward repetition of phrasing and abstract formulations (“the truth she had discovered,” “lesson she had learned,” “genuinely artificial”) that could be pared for greater sharpness. A few lines edge into didactic or near-platitudinous territory, slightly dulling momentum near the end. Nonetheless, clarity is strong, and the final constellation image lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of mourning jewelry, a timeless observatory tracking souls, “curtains of intention,” coordinate tattoos, and origami messages feels strikingly particular and non-derivative. The premise meaningfully reimagines grief work within a fantastical cosmology rather than leaning on familiar afterlife tropes. The conceptual throughline from “genuinely artificial” memorials to transformative, coordinate-bearing paper figures is especially inventive. Its main limit is that the thematic takeaway is conventional even as the vehicle for it is fresh, keeping it just shy of the very top band.</comment>
