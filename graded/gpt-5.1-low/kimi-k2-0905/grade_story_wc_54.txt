<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Alya’s motives and temperament are sharply etched: a pragmatic, quietly idealistic engineer trying to “resurrect hope” via systems rather than sentiment. Her choices (entering, tracing flows, rerouting glycol, rewriting the board, then leaving with intent to return) all arise credibly from that core. Interiority is embedded in perception and metaphor rather than explicit self-analysis, which works well. The main limitation is a relative lack of on-page contradiction or moral friction in her—she moves from resolve to fulfillment with little internal push–pull.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The piece follows a clean accumulative-causal arc: enter terminal → diagnose hydraulics → experiment with flow → awaken birds/drone/fountain → reprice the place’s purpose → depart with a new rule for hope. Closure is strong and on the page, in the combined awakening of the machinery and the conceptual shift (“measure what returns”) that reframes the terminal as a site of repair rather than failed departure. Each beat grows logically out of the last without unkept setups or teleporting elements. The cost is quieter and conceptual rather than dramatic, but it is legible in her acceptance of a long, lonely reclamation project instead of instant triumph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid, specific, and fully integrated: the abandoned spaceport’s gates, canals, pumps, brass birds, and fountain are both atmosphere and machinery. Environmental constraints directly shape action—her work depends on these exact hydraulic and architectural remnants, and the final images (birds patrolling, equations fluttering, pre-dawn exit) are inseparable from this place. Textures like “Martian vermillion” rust and ghostly carnival traces deepen mood without feeling like a static tour. A slight risk of sensory overload remains but does not harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Alya can coax a dead terminal into a living system of hope—is clear and consistently pursued. Pressure does escalate in a textural way as more systems awaken (birds, drone, fountain) and the implications of her meddling expand from small sculpture to a whole complex. However, opposition is mostly inert (time, rust, abandonment) and rarely pushes back in a way that forces hard trade-offs or genuine risk. The result is a satisfyingly deepening mood rather than a sharply tightening vise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme is robust and organically carried: redirected flow as a model for hope, resurrection over perfection, and the reorientation from escape to repair all arise from action and image. The “maze of intentions” reconfiguring inward, the architect’s dictum (“Design for resurrection, not perfection; flow is forgiving”), and the closing rule (“Measure what returns…”) collectively reweight everything that came before. The story resists a neat moral by acknowledging loss and evaporation alongside reclaimed wonder. A few explicit formulations (the written equation for hope) come close to thesis-statement territory but stay just inside character-voiced, in-world logic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrically technical, and consistent with a scientifically minded but imaginative focalizer; metaphors lean on engineering, astronomy, and hydraulics in a coherent way. Psychic distance is well controlled, staying close to Alya’s perceptions while allowing compressed, patterned diction appropriate to a lyric short. Brief dialogue (Alya’s line, the architect’s subroutines) feels distinct and purposeful without breaking the established tone. There are no POV slips or register jolts, and rhythm modulates nicely between dense image and cleaner declarative lines.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is rich and high-density, with many lines doing double duty for setting, character, and theme (“Each weld she improvised was a stanza in a grammar of reclamation…”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent, and sentence rhythms vary enough to keep momentum. There’s little scaffolding or repetition, and action order remains clear despite the lyricism. The only constraint on an even higher score is that the lushness occasionally skirts purple, risking reader saturation in a few adjacent metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements—abandoned spaceport as hydraulic corpse, carnival ghosts, an engineer resurrecting kinetic birds via redirected glycol, and a holographic jester-architect preaching “resurrection, not perfection”—feels genuinely distinctive. The central conceptual turn (departure infrastructure repurposed inward toward repair and communal hope) is fresh and thematically potent. Risks in style and conceit mostly pay off, avoiding genre cliché despite familiar ingredients like spaceports and holograms. It stops short of utterly surprising moral calculus or a wrenching cost, which keeps it just below the very top band.</comment>
