<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Aris’s motivation is clear and consistent—from professional duty to obsessive curiosity to the self-endangering urge to preserve truth—and her final lie reads as an earned, costly choice rather than a convenience. The internal conflict between truth-telling and survival is present but could be more viscerally embodied on the page; her fear in the meeting with Kael is summarized more than dramatized. Kael himself functions effectively as a pressure source, but he is thinly characterized and leans toward archetype. The final endurance stance—keeping the secret internally as a “grave”—is credible and tied to prior traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: noticing anomalous numbers → investigation of metadata → discovery of the commander’s poem → uncovering the cover-up → confrontation with Kael → decision to lie. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with one coherent dominant drive (what really happened to Voyager / where do deleted files go) and a clear closure beat. Some investigative steps are summarized (“She cross-referenced everything”) rather than dramatized, which slightly flattens mid-story tension. The ending provides an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: Aris’s choice redefines “deleted” as a state dependent on human memory with a tangible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The “digital necropolis” of the social network archive and the “data-morgue” are vivid, economical images that effectively fuse setting with the story’s preoccupation with death, absence, and memory. The environment is more than a backdrop: the corporate archive’s restrictions, encryption layers, and graveyard for corrupted files directly shape what Aris can and cannot do. The recurring “echo of forgotten songs” nicely links atmosphere to the final image of maintained, buried memory. A bit more tactile or sensory specificity of Aris’s physical interaction with the archive space could further heighten immersion, but the current level is strong and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The central conflict—truth and remembrance versus corporate suppression and personal risk—is established early and tightens through the discovery that the public mission is fabricated. The stakes escalate appropriately when the abstract mystery becomes a direct threat via Kael’s warning, forcing Aris into a concrete ethical choice (expose vs. conceal). The cost of her choice is emotionally and conceptually legible, though the immediate danger in the confrontation scene could feel sharper or more specific. Internal and external stakes (her obsession versus corporate power) are well braided and converge cleanly at the lie.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of erasure, institutional memory, corporate propaganda, and the ethics of remembering are woven through the archive setting, the missing crew, and Aris’s role as a living repository. The patch, the corrupted files, and the “grave for six people” image all work as specific, grounded carriers of these ideas. The final realization—that deleted files “go into the keepers who choose to remember”—is resonant but also somewhat explicitly stated, edging toward thematic telling rather than leaving more space for reader inference. Still, the story largely earns its insights through dramatized discovery rather than overt moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The third-person close voice is steady, coherent, and comfortably inhabits Aris’s technical yet reflective perspective, with some nice turns of phrase (“frozen river of thoughts”). POV is well controlled, with no leakage or unjustified omniscience, and the brief dialogue feels natural to the setting and stakes. However, the narrative voice leans toward a polished, generalized SF-literary register rather than something distinctly idiosyncratic to Aris herself. Under peak pressure, the voice maintains clarity but doesn’t significantly modulate or sharpen in rhythm to heighten the scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose is generally clean, concise, and purposeful, with a good information density and minimal redundancy; metaphors like “digital necropolis” and “frozen river of thoughts” are apt and not overstacked. There are minor repetitions (“echo of forgotten songs” reappears almost verbatim) and slightly abstract phrases (“terrible truth,” “fragile truth”) where more concrete language could add immediacy. Sentence rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and there are no notable grammar or clarity issues. Overall, line-level craft supports momentum and atmosphere effectively, even if it doesn’t yet feel exceptional.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise of a corporate archivist uncovering a space-mission cover-up is familiar, but it’s refreshed by the specific angle of social network necrology and the conceptual twist that “deleted” things persist in human keepers. The recurring numerical glitch as breadcrumb and the idea of a “data-morgue” for corrupted files are nicely particular. The emotional and ethical calculus—choosing to preserve truth privately rather than expose it—is believable but not especially surprising within the genre. The story feels solidly above-template but does not yet achieve a strikingly singular or risky vision.</comment>
