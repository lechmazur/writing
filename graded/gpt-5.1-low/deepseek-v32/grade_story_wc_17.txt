<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The narrator’s vocation and curiosity are clear and consistent, and the ethical shift from mere listener to burdened witness is legible. However, interiority leans on generalized phrasing (“I felt the weight of their guilt”) rather than specific, character-particular contradiction under pressure. The decision to deactivate the device comes quickly and without much dramatized ambivalence or cost. This limits the sense of a fully earned internal change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: exploration → diaries → film strip → device revelation → deactivation → departure with a new sense of responsibility. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the narrator’s understanding of “legacy’s burden” and their role shifts in a way that clearly reframes the opening premise. The structure is linear, coherent, and appropriate to the length, though the major turns remain relatively low in resistance and complication. There are no orientation or lens-clarity issues undermining closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage, damp stone, and reclaimed estate are vividly evoked and tonally appropriate, with selective sensory detail (smell of decay, drip of water) supporting the mood. Setting matters functionally: the fireplace and hidden panel in the corridor are necessary to the discovery and resolution. However, the environment rarely constrains tactic-level choices; it’s more a strong backdrop than an active obstacle. The final sense of the passage as a “tomb of memories” nicely reweights the space but stops short of transformative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering and perhaps easing the house’s legacy burden—is present, and the discovery of the device plus its deactivation functions as an escalation in knowledge and responsibility. Yet conflict remains mostly abstract and internal; there is little tangible resistance, danger, or dilemma around whether to use, leave, or destroy the device. The blueprint allows for a nearly frictonless resolution, so cost is felt conceptually more than viscerally. As a result, tension deepens but doesn’t truly tighten.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Themes of memory, guilt, and responsibility across generations integrate well with the climate-shift backdrop and “walls dream” motif. However, the piece undercuts its own subtext by stating its thesis directly (“we must remember what walls dream about, so we never repeat the past”), drifting into moralizing rather than letting images and actions do the work. The emotional aftereffect is clear but somewhat didactic. There is limited room for ambiguity or counter-reading.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The first-person voice is steady and coherent, with some striking formulations (“corridor echo cartographer”, “what walls dream about”) that fit the conceit. That said, much of the narration settles into neutral reportage and summary, lacking the idiosyncratic rhythms or sensory biases that would make the voice truly memorable. Psychic distance is handled cleanly, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. Overall the POV is competent rather than distinctive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentences are grammatically clean and easy to follow, with a clear progression of ideas and minimal clutter. There is some redundancy and label-telling (“sensitively perceptive”, “legacy’s burden” reiterated) instead of fresh embodiment, and the prose rarely takes surprising risks at the line level. Still, momentum is maintained, paragraphs generally add new information, and there is no major overwriting or metaphor muddle. The final cadence works but could be sharpened by pruning repeated thematic language.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The notion of a “corridor echo cartographer” listening to what walls dream, set against a climate-collapse legacy experiment, is an appealing and fresh synthesis. The film strip as mnemonic key and the idea of sonic memory in architecture add originality to a familiar “ruined estate with dark secret” frame. Execution of the central turn (blueprint, deactivation) is more conventional and could push further into the strange logic suggested by the premise. Still, the conceptual frame stands out as more than a stock post-apocalyptic vignette.</comment>
