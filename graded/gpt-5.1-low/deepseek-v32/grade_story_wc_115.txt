<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Alex’s motives (reckless curiosity, moral need to understand the accident) are clear and consistent, and his skepticism adds a useful edge, but his internal conflict stays mostly conceptual rather than embodied in specific, pressured micro-choices. Mara’s role is powerful in premise (confessing complicity) yet under-dramatized on the page, so their relationship never fully becomes a crucible. The final witnessing moment is earned but emotionally tidy, with little sense of real risk or contradiction in Alex. Overall, characterization is solid but not yet at a level where the moral cost feels truly jagged or ambivalent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: confession → hush and “drowsy alertness” → radio clues → valve/wheel recognition → confrontation with the ghost shift → witnessing and partial release. Closure is on the page and legible as a resonant reconfiguration: once the truth is witnessed, the ghost shift stops, with a conceptual cost around responsibility. However, the psychic radio mirroring his exact location and object feels convenient, and the solution (speak the truth, ghosts vanish) lands a bit mechanically. Structure is coherent and effective, but lacks the extra complexity or friction that would push it higher for a prestige venue.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tunnel and mill are vividly evoked with concrete sensory detail (“smelled of rust and wet stone,” “cavernous space where shadows seemed to move”) and the industrial atmosphere supports the theme of buried labor and responsibility. The beaded valve wheel functions as a recurring, charged object that meaningfully anchors the final image. While the environment does shape movement (side passage, rusted door, depth into the mill), the physical constraints and dangers of such a space don’t fully bear on his choices beyond mood. Strong, purposeful setting work, just shy of using environment as a true tactical constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stakes are moral and conceptual—acknowledging culpability and releasing a haunted repetition—which is a fine choice, but on-page pressure remains relatively gentle. Escalation is present (deeper into the tunnel, radio clues sharpen, then the ghost shift appears), and Alex’s decision to speak and witness is a clear turning point. However, he faces little genuine risk or competing good, so the choice reads more as fulfilling the story’s thesis than as a hard-won trade-off. The conflict is functional and coherent but not as tense or costly as it could be.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The themes of swallowed truth, moral weight, and collective memory replaying tragedy are coherent and strongly woven through motifs like the beaded valve wheel and the looping ghost shift. Yet the story frequently states its thesis outright (“The weight of the swallowed truth was not a physical mass, but a moral one, finally measured”), undercutting subtext. The ending in particular explains its own meaning instead of letting the final images and Alex’s altered stance do that work. Thematic intent is solid and resonant, but execution leans into moralizing rather than trusting implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The third-person-limited POV on Alex is stable and clear, with consistent access to his perceptions and framework (skepticism, methodical use of psychic radio). The narrative voice is clean and competent, occasionally finding nice textural touches, though it rarely feels idiosyncratic or deeply tied to Alex’s unique mental music. Some abstract phrases (“religious skepticism,” “conceptual weight”) drift toward a more essayistic register, especially near the end, but not enough to break coherence. Overall, the voice is solidly controlled but not yet distinctive enough for elite publication.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The prose is generally clear, rhythmically varied, and efficient, with atmospheric lines that pull double duty for mood and information. There are some repetitions and paraphrase-y constructions (“weight of a swallowed truth,” “drowsy alertness”) and a tendency to summarize pivotal beats (Mara’s confession, Alex’s explanation to the ghosts and then to Mara) rather than dramatize them. The closing paragraphs shift into explanatory mode, sapping a bit of momentum and image-driven resonance. Still, line-level control is good overall and free of serious artifacts or muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The combination of an industrial “ghost shift” and the quirky method of mining talk-radio psychic calls for local lore feels fresh and conceptually intriguing. The idea that psychic broadcasts are fragmented echoes of the ghost shift’s memory is a strong, non-obvious connection. However, the underlying arc—haunting as replay of unacknowledged guilt, resolved by witnessing and confession—is familiar, and the story doesn’t fully subvert or deepen that pattern. Originality sits in the details and frame more than in a truly surprising emotional or structural turn.</comment>
