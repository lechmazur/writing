<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Aris and Elara both feel particular and embodied; his professional detachment shading into loneliness and her lucid, almost curatorial approach to her own dying are well-drawn. Motivation is clear and specific—her need for a “witness,” his mapping of healing—and their brief relationship carries emotional weight. Internal contradiction is present but subtle rather than dramatized in sharp moments (e.g., we’re told his motivation, less often shown clashing with fear, fatigue, or avoidance). The closing endurance—him staying in the garden with her story and thread—is credibly earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Structure is clean: the ship’s departure strands him, he goes to the garden, they co-create the obituary, she dies, and he reconfigures his task in the final scene. The inferred drive lens is accumulative/textural; pressure builds through layered images rather than big reversals, and closure arrives in a resonant reconfiguration of his work and her presence. Causality is coherent and orientation is strong; the brief time jump at her death is handled smoothly. The emotional cost—her loss and his altered solitude—is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The garden is richly, specifically rendered—smell of damp earth and fallen apples, rust and gold leaves, frosted hedges—and always filtered through grief and memory. The space evolves from sanctuary to conversation ground to monument, clearly charging the final image of him sitting under bare branches. The recurring objects (garden, thread, stars) anchor the abstract “geography of healing” in concrete environment. It stops short of 9+ only because the setting shapes emotional rather than practical choices; it doesn’t significantly constrain tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Elara’s “explained absence” can ever be enough, and how Aris bears that—is signaled clearly and deepens as she tires and questions the record. Escalation is quiet but real: the movement from storytelling to the “Do you think it will be enough?” moment to her death and his solitary return is a meaningful tightening under an accumulative lens. Aris’s agency is primarily endurance and attention rather than overt decision, which suits the piece but keeps pressure low-key. The felt price is present yet not sharply dramatized as a trade-off, which nudges this just under the strongest band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of loss, inheritance, and how stories “project presence” recur through the ship, the carpet thread, the garden, and the idea of mapping healing. The final image—him under the stars with the thread, seeing her as part of the pattern—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening question of what an obituary for the living can do. However, some thematic material is more stated than earned in subtext (“His motivation, as ever, was to understand the geography of healing”; “His own healing… was a search for these threads”), edging toward essayistic. This reduces the sense of discovery at the end.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The third-person limited voice, closely aligned with Aris, is controlled and lyrically consistent, with smooth modulation between external description and interior inference. Dialogue is sparse but natural and purposeful, especially Elara’s “Do you think it will be enough?” which carries layered stakes. There are moments where the narration states motives and methods in an almost omniscient, explanatory register, slightly flattening the intimacy of the POV. Overall, though, the perceptual signature—how he notices pattern, thread, and map—is distinct and coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The line-level writing is polished, with strong rhythms and concrete, multi-sensory imagery; many sentences do more than one job (atmosphere, character, and theme at once). Phrases like “tapestry of decay and lonesome splendor” and “grand, fraying carpet of human connection” are vivid yet near the edge of purple, and similar metaphors are reiterated, creating mild redundancy. Still, there’s little scaffolding or obvious looped phrasing, and syntax varies well. The closure image is clear and unblurred by figurative excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise—a traveler who writes obituaries for the living, stranded after the last ship as he witnesses a dying woman’s “explained absence”—is fresh and handled with seriousness rather than gimmick. The palace carpet thread as a weft for memory and homeland, repurposed as a metaphor for time, love, and human connection, gives the story a distinctive symbolic spine. Some imagery (autumn garden, last leaf, last ship) leans on familiar grief tropes, but the synthesis feels particular rather than generic. The story takes a measured risk in embracing a fully lyric, low-incident structure and largely makes it work.</comment>
