<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Leo’s characterization is coherent and particular: his reticence, gentle protectiveness, and observational nature all manifest in his actions (stone messages, letter couriering, bottling “safety”). Motivation is clear and steadily deepens from routine duty to a conscious desire to protect both keepers and ghost. The main limitation is a relative lack of internal contradiction or sharply dramatized internal conflict under pressure; his choices feel right but a bit too smooth. The final endurance—carrying the bottled light away, accepting a dark beam—is earned and carries a quiet cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: lamp fails → investigation → letters reveal emotional and supernatural stakes → decision to reassure and then release the ghost via the bottled safety. Structure is linear, with one main deepening when the second, ghost-revealing letter reframes the “haunting” as overextended duty and clarifies what his intervention must accomplish. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the ghost departs, the beam stays dark, but the tower now “holds a light from within” and Leo leaves with a tangible promise. The only drag on a higher score is that the solution (bottling safety) is somewhat lightly foreshadowed and encounters minimal on-page resistance or complication.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lighthouse, sea, and lantern room are richly and specifically rendered—“glass-paned crown,” “luminescent ache,” salt wind on the narrow gallery—without feeling touristic. Setting is strongly POV-filtered through a working skipper used to these places, and weather/architecture meaningfully shape choices (stone cairn on gallery, bottle ritual in the room, mooring scene). Objects-as-setting (sea glass, stones, letters, lamp) all charge the closing image and the emotional cost. The piece uses atmosphere to support theme—lonely vigilance and interior light—at a high level.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—easing the crushing solitude/duty of the lighthouse, for both the living and the dead—is legible early via the anonymous letters and escalates with the lamp’s failure and ghost revelation. There is a clear tightening once Leo understands the ghost’s nature and chooses an active, imaginative solution, foreclosing the possibility of leaving the haunting or beam failure unaddressed. Internal and external conflicts are elegantly braided, but opposition remains mostly atmospheric; Leo faces little real doubt, pushback, or risk beyond the melancholic cost of letting the ghost go and accepting a dark beam. As a result, pressure is solid but never quite sharp enough to reach the top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Thematic strands—duty versus rest, loneliness versus connection, safety as something that can be “bottled” and passed on—emerge naturally from the letters, the stone code, and the final bottle without overt moralizing. The anonymous letter chain as a lifeline “for the living and the dead” ties the emotional logic together, and the final image of an inwardly lit but dark-beamed tower reweights the premise in a satisfying way. The story resists simplistic binaries by granting the ghost’s duty respect while still framing rest as necessary and bittersweet. A touch more ambiguity or friction around what is lost when the beam goes dark could deepen the aftertaste further.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The third-person, close-focus narration has a consistent, slightly lyrical voice that fits Leo’s quiet, observant temperament and the maritime ghost setting. Diction is controlled and patterned (“luminescent ache,” “pressure of lonely vigilance”) without slipping into self-consciousness or register clashes. Psychic distance is handled well, hovering near Leo’s perceptions without omniscient leakage, and there is no head-hopping or POV confusion. The voice is distinctive and textured, though its emotional modulation under peak stress is relatively gentle rather than dynamically varied.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythm is smooth, and most lines pull double duty in advancing atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but purposeful and internally coherent; repeated phrases like “luminescent ache” work as motifs rather than redundancy. There’s little scaffolding, minimal paraphrase looping, and the prose remains clear even in more abstract moments (bottling “safety”). A slightly tighter trim of a few ornamental adjectives could make it even leaner, but nothing significant dulls momentum or obscures cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>While lighthouses and ghosts are familiar, the specific synthesis—anonymous inter-keeper confession chain, stone-stacking semaphore, and the quasi-magical act of bottling a feeling of safety—is fresh and memorable. The twist that the “haunting” is a ghost clinging to duty, and that Leo’s solution preserves duty symbolically rather than banishing it, gives the piece conceptual distinctiveness. Emotional truth feels grounded, not gimmicky, and the final image of an unlit but inwardly glowing tower is a non-obvious, earned reconfiguration. It stops just short of the truly startling or radical, but operates at a high level of originality within its chosen palette.</comment>
