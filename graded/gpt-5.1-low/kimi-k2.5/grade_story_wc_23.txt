<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The navigator’s interiority is vivid, specific, and embodied—her arrhythmic leg, lunar cognition, and refusal to evacuate read as one coherent, flawed psyche under pressure. Motivation (to reach her daughter / the departed through this compass of grief) is clear and steadily intensifies as she builds. The Earned Stasis at the end—choosing to remain and touch the humming bronze—is fully motivated and costs her any illusion of outward rescue. The only small limitation is that contradictory impulses (leave vs. stay, hope vs. acceptance) are stated more in conceptual terms than dramatized in a pressured on-page dilemma.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The accumulative structure is clean: hydraulics fail → she follows cryptic calls → assembles the fulcrum → activates it and redefines what “navigation” means. Causality is consistent and driven by her choices, with no orientation issues despite the lyric mode. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she completes the internal lighthouse and accepts reverse migration as coming home to ruin. Stakes and cost are legible, though the structural turn is more conceptual than dramatic, keeping it just shy of the very top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The signal station, rusted hydraulics, and censer foot are richly textured and always filtered through her functional needs (repurposing dead hydraulics, matching verdigris, stars wheeling outside). Environment constrains action—she can only work with salvage, a failing tower, and old machinery—and the final image of her hand on the warm bronze is charged by all that accrued materiality. World rules (rising seas, evacuation inland, lunar-tied neurology) feel consistent and integrated rather than expository. This is near top-tier setting work, kept from 9+ mostly by staying in a single emotional register instead of using the space to generate sharper on-page tactical friction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether she can construct a meaningful way to “navigate” loss rather than flee it—is clear early and deepens as she assembles and then activates the device. Escalation is primarily internal and textural: the gibbous moon bringing cognitive clarity, the click “like a bone settling,” the humming bronze reweighting what navigation means. Her final choice to accept being “navigator of nothing external now” forecloses escape and is earned. Pressure never quite tightens into a sharp, dilemma-like pinch point on the page, which keeps the conflict from feeling fully maximal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Loss, reverse migration, and the act of deliberately inhabiting ruin are tightly braided into every image and decision, and the ending reweights the whole piece: geography of loss as something built, not crossed. The censer-as-compass and inward-turned lighthouse beam are powerful thematic images that resonate beyond the story. However, some thematic sentences move into essayistic exposition—“The geography of loss wasn't terrain you crossed; it was terrain you constructed”—which flattens subtext into stated thesis. That explicitness slightly blunts what would otherwise be an even more haunting, open-ended resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The third-person limited voice is consistent, textured, and unmistakably hers—technical terms (hydraulics, meridians, satellites) sit naturally beside mythic and devotional language. Rhythm and syntax modulate well between dense, lyrical reflections and more grounded mechanical actions like soldering and fitting the censer foot. The perceptual signature—war salvage body, lunar cognition, radio ghosts—is distinctive and coherent, with no POV leakage or stance confusion. It falls just shy of 9+ because a few thematic declarations edge toward the abstract rather than trusting the voice’s rich imagery to carry meaning implicitly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and most metaphors are precise and reinforcing rather than decorative (e.g., “its bell a wound opening in the dark,” “a lighthouse beam turned backward against the fog”). There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and every paragraph advances either emotional pressure or conceptual stakes. The figurative density flirts with overload but generally stays controlled and legible, with no mixed metaphors or rhythm artifacts that obscure causality or the closure image. A few lines venture into slightly abstract phrasing, yet they don’t materially drag momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-climate-collapse lighthouse, lunar-tied cognition, grief as cartography, and a censer-foot compass for the dead feels strikingly original and unified. “Reverse migration” as returning to ruin instead of safety, and a lighthouse that signals inward rather than out, are memorable reinventions of familiar motifs. The story fully commits to its strange premise and follows its implications to a charged, conceptually rich end image. Its risk-taking is high and successful; the only reason it doesn’t quite cross into 9+ is that some thematic explication is a touch more familiar than the otherwise startling imagery.</comment>
