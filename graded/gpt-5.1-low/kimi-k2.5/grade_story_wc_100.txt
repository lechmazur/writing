<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marian’s vocation, weariness, and core motive (“to give rest a permanent address”) are vivid and specific, and her inadvertent stubbornness ties cleanly into the thematic architecture. Her resistance to the summons has credible roots in her values, and her eventual acceptance of the task reads as earned rather than convenient. The internal contradiction—soil-bound dignity vs. answering the oceanic call—is present but mostly summarized rather than dramatized in real-time decisions, which slightly softens the sense of struggle. Still, for this length, she feels particular, embodied, and consistent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean and legible: crate → distress signals → impossible low tide → descent → library → installation of the lens → reconfiguration of the dead’s condition. Closure is strong: the library becomes a true lighthouse; the dead gain coordinates; Marian’s role reconfigures from undertaker to librarian, a Decisive Change with conceptual cost. The drive feels Hybrid (causal arc with accumulative lyric density), and that lens holds through the end. If anything, the middle lacks a complicating turn or obstacle once she chooses to go below, but the structure remains solid and satisfying.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is rich, strange, and purposeful: the impossible receding tide, the wound-like ocean trench, and the marble-columned underwater library all feel both concrete and uncanny. Details like “books floated like schools of silver fish” and “steps that corkscrewed through liquid stone” aren’t ornamental; they embody the rules of this reality and charge the final image of a reconfigured, settled library. Environment and key objects (lens, columns, stacks) directly shape what Marian can do and what resolution looks like. The world-building is economical yet immersive, with the setting inseparable from premise and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the restless dead can gain a fixed resting place through Marian’s choices—is clear and escalates from private discomfort to a metaphysical obligation. The distress signals intensifying and the ocean’s impossible retreat provide one firm tightening, and her ascent to the dome with the lens functions as a focused climax. However, once she commits to entering the sea, the opposition is mostly conceptual; there are no further hard trade-offs or on-page resistances testing her resolve. The cost is more thematic than viscerally felt, which keeps the pressure solid but not searing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The piece develops a resonant theme about the instability of death and memory in a shifting world, and the need to invent new “addresses” for rest when the old ones fail. The lighthouse-library and the broken lens become potent metaphors for location, remembrance, and the ethics of caretaking the dead without resorting to bald moralizing. Lines like “burial meant nothing when the earth itself migrated and forgot its dead” and the closing transformation into “a new librarian in an old silence” deepen the conceptual frame rather than simply explain it. A bit of explicit statement about her motivation edges toward essayistic, but it remains grounded in specific, earned images.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The third-person voice is consistent, lyrically confident, and clearly filtered through Marian’s sensibility as a weary, practical mystic of death. Syntax and rhythm vary in ways that match emotional shifts—from the pulsing, incantatory early lines to the calmer, declarative closure. The diction (“impossible space,” “geography that occupied the breath between moments”) feels of a piece, with no jarring register shifts or POV leakage. Even without dialogue, the narrative voice has a distinct texture and authority appropriate to a high-end literary venue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line by line, the prose is tight and purposeful: most sentences do double duty in advancing action and deepening mood or concept. Metaphors are abundant but coherent and controlled, rarely slipping into mixed or overblown territory; images like “the water accepted her ankles…with the gentleness of a sheet being drawn up” are precise and evocative. There is minimal scaffolding, little to no paraphrase looping, and the rhythm carries momentum without becoming monotonous. A high density of figurative language in places nuzzles the edge of lushness, but it doesn’t obscure clarity or blunt the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The fusion of a weary undertaker, an impossible underwater library, and a lighthouse lens that focuses not light but location feels genuinely fresh. The idea that death’s problem is shifting coordinates and that an undertaker must reinvent rest as a metaphysical address is a non-obvious, memorable reframing of familiar ghost and afterlife motifs. The final reconfiguration—books becoming fixed, the dead settling into architecture, Marian recast as librarian—pays off this originality in a way that feels inevitable in hindsight. It narrowly misses the 9+ band only because the emotional and ethical price of Marian’s choice is more hinted than sharply contoured on the page.</comment>
