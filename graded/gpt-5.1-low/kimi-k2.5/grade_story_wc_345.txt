<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motivations are clear and consistent—protect the settlement, make sense of Thomas’s messages—but her interiority is sketched rather than deeply contoured, with limited contradictory impulses on the page. The line about “the timeframe of after strangers become family” is evocative but not fully dramatized through specific frictions or micro-choices. Thomas as a ghost reads as morally pure and one-note, which flattens potential complexity. The final shift—Mara accepting the haunting as love and taking up the bell—is earned but emotionally a touch too smooth for the scale of what’s implied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: ghost messages → Mara’s investigation → council persuasion → midnight ritual → nebula and farewell, giving legible before/after stakes around survival. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the colony now has partial protection and Mara conceptually reprices haunting as enduring care, with Thomas’s departure as cost. The piece, however, glosses over any serious obstacles or near-failures during the implementation, so escalation feels more assumed than tested. Still, the structure fits the length and the ending’s cost—fragility of the shield, Thomas’s final fading—registers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and specific—twin suns, frostbitten apple orchards, and floating rock arches are integrated into the colony’s tactics and the nebula’s mechanics. The arches and atmospheric anomalies directly constrain and enable choices, making the environment functionally necessary to the solution. The butterfly garden and watering bell miniaturize the world into a charged micro-setting that carries through to the final image. Worldbuilding remains economical and consistent, with no major infodump drag.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes (long-term survival vs. hostile atmosphere) are conceptually high but on-page pressure is relatively gentle; no one meaningfully resists Mara, and the operation faces no visible setbacks. The main tightening is Mara decoding the messages via star charts and convincing the council, but this persuasion and the risks of trusting a ghost are reported rather than sharpened into tense beats. The midnight execution of the plan proceeds almost too smoothly, undercutting felt danger or trade-off. As a result, the conflict is coherent but not especially bracing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Themes of chosen family, mutual care, and love persisting past death are woven through orchards, the bell, and the nebula as cultivated respite rather than miracle. The final realization that “some hauntings were simply love that refused to abandon its orchard” reweights earlier images effectively. However, the text leans into overt thematic articulation (“Family takes care of family, even across the veil”) that edges toward moralizing, slightly reducing subtlety. The piece maintains emotional honesty and avoids cheap sentiment, but the insights are more graceful than surprising.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical without losing clarity, and colored by Mara’s sensibility (attention to orchards, charts, communal table). Syntax and rhythm modulate well between exposition, council scene, and ritual without obvious register slips or head-hopping. Diction choices like “brambled hope” and “nebula of respite” feel cohesive with the world’s tone rather than tacked on. There is a light touch of authorial overview in describing Thomas’s continued “selflessness,” but it doesn’t significantly break POV integrity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images precise, and most carry multiple functions (worldbuilding plus emotion, theme plus action). Figurative language is present but not so dense as to become purple, and extended metaphors (orchard/family, nebula/respite) remain coherent. There is minor redundancy (e.g., reiterating that messages appear on deserted sidewalks at dawn) but not enough to drag momentum. The final paragraphs land cleanly without figurative muddle or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a hard-SF-ish colony setup with an altruistic, practical ghost guiding atmospheric engineering feels fresh and emotionally grounded. Using orchards, butterflies, and a watering bell to frame a planetary-scale survival mechanism is a distinctive choice. The broad arc—benevolent ghost helps community, then departs once its task is done—is somewhat familiar, but the specific planetary and agricultural inflections keep it from feeling generic. More risk in complicating Thomas’s role or the community’s response could have pushed the ingenuity higher.</comment>
