<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Maya’s characterization as a “creeping normality noticer” is vivid and particular, and her method of reading displaced objects feels intrinsic to who she is. Her motive—to understand why some houses feel alive—is clear and consistent, and her choices flow logically from that desire. The main limitation is the relative lack of internal contradiction or felt cost; she moves from curiosity to insight with little emotional friction. The piece hints that her attention has consequences but doesn’t fully explore her ambivalence or responsibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The structure is cleanly accumulative: observation → pattern recognition → discovery of the “shard of hush” → consecrating act → reconfigured understanding. Orientation is excellent from the opening line, and the bay, cottages, and method of investigation are all quickly and coherently grounded. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: houses shift from “haunted” to listening entities, and Maya’s role shifts from observer to participant. The cost is subtle—more conceptual than dramatic—which slightly limits the impact at a prestigious-fiction level.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is richly rendered and tightly woven into the premise: the quiet bay, shifting fence posts, and lilacs “too thickly for April” all serve the sense of slow, almost geological awareness. Environmental details are consistently filtered through Maya’s way of seeing, avoiding tourist-list description. The bay’s tides and the cottages’ rearrangements inform both her method and the final image of the glowing house and moving fence posts. The setting doesn’t sharply constrain her choices, but it heavily charges the atmosphere and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Maya’s need to understand the aliveness of houses—remains largely internal and cerebral, with minimal overt opposition. There is one clear deepening when she discovers the shard of hush and realizes the houses are listening, and another when her small act unexpectedly consecrates the boundary. However, there’s little sense of risk if she fails, and the escalation is more tonal than pressured. The lack of tangible or emotional cost at the peak keeps the conflict from feeling fully weighty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the action: attention as a creative force, spaces as sponges for human quiet, and the idea that perception can sanctify the world. Recurring motifs—the orris root, displaced objects, hush between heartbeats—recur with deepened meaning by the end. Lines like “The aliveness wasn’t intrusion but accumulation” verge on explicit statement but are still grounded in concrete images. The piece favors a single, elegant insight over complex moral entanglement, which slightly narrows its thematic range but maintains strong resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The third-person close voice is confident and distinctive, with a lyrical but controlled register that suits Maya’s hyper-attentive perception. Phrasing such as “streetlights daydreamed in their half-awake hum” and “creeping normality noticer” feels both specific and character-inflected, not generically poetic. Psychic distance remains stable, and there’s no head-hopping or gratuitous exposition. The voice modulates subtly as insight consolidates, but the emotional temperature stays fairly even, which keeps it from feeling fully elastic under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is elegant and economical, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (world-building, characterization, and thematic seeding) without obvious scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and well-chosen, e.g., “a shard of hush, crystallized absence of sound” and “streetlights daydreamed,” which support the story’s metaphysics. There are no visible loops, syntactic monotony, or generation artifacts, and rhythm reads smoothly aloud. A few phrases nudge toward the purple, but they don’t obscure clarity or dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The core conceit—houses as listening entities grown around crystallized hush, read via displaced objects—is fresh and memorably executed. It transforms the haunted-house trope into something contemplative and strange without feeling gimmicky. The orris root, fence posts, and “hush between heartbeats” synthesize into a coherent, idiosyncratic vision that feels specific to this story and voice. The risks taken are stylistic and conceptual rather than structural, and they pay off with a distinct aesthetic signature.</comment>
