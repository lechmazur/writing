<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elian’s vocation and method (“obituaries for the living,” projecting presence) give him a distinct, coherent psychology, and his emotional state is rendered through concrete, character-specific perceptions. His motivation—to understand and map healing—is clear and threads through his choices to write, to conjure Malvine, and finally to leave. The internal shift from clinging to presence to accepting himself as “cartographer of their own vacant spaces” reads earned. There could be a touch more lived contradiction or messiness under peak pressure, but what’s here is strong and particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The accumulative structure is clean: we move from his stranded state, through the summoning of Malvine’s presence and the intense writing act, to the dissolution of the projection and a resolved inward stance. Causality is coherent under a textural lens—wind threatens the projection, urgency spikes the writing, and the finished page precipitates the final acceptance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: tying the thread, reframing absence, and deciding to travel inland all make the before/after legible with emotional cost. The piece remains a quiet, largely internal arc, but it does not feel static or arbitrary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The garden, emptied harbor, palace, autumnal decay, and stars are vividly and economically rendered, with sensory detail consistently filtered through Elian’s grief and vocation. The environment is not a postcard: the emptied harbor and “last ship” concretely fix his isolation, and the garden’s shadow and seasonal death mirror his emotional terrain. The palace carpet thread functions as a micro-setting object that heavily charges the final image, literally tethering him to the loss and its reinterpreted meaning. Setting and object together constrain options (he cannot follow, must turn inward) and power the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Elian can transform raw loss into a livable, mapped form of healing—is clear and appropriate to the length. Pressure deepens as his projected Duchess flickers and “turns her head as if hearing a distant call,” narrowing his emotional options and forcing him to write under a sense of imminent disappearance. The key tightening is the dissolution of the projection once the elegy is done, which forecloses his fantasy of continued presence and pushes him toward acceptance and departure. Escalation is mostly internal and lyrical rather than sharply reversible, but it is coherent and lands with a felt, if quiet, cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Themes of explained absence, grieving the living, and “the geography of healing” are richly developed through concrete motifs: the thread, the empty harbor, the negative spaces Malvine no longer occupies. The idea that survival has a “lonesome splendor” arises organically from his practices and the closing images of stars and echoing sails. However, the line “He understood now that the geography of healing required…” edges into explicit thesis-stating, slightly flattening what the images already convey. The piece still invites reflection beyond the scene, but a shade more restraint from overt commentary would heighten its resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and unmistakably flavored by Elian’s sensibility as a meticulous mourner and writer; his perceptions and metaphors feel of a piece. Diction is elevated but suits the quasi-historical courtly milieu and the character’s inner life, and psychic distance is managed smoothly. There is no head-hopping, and the narrative stance maintains plausible access to his knowledge and inferences. At times the lyricism risks uniformity, but it never slips out of character or undercuts clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose shows strong rhythmic control and high information density, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and character. Images like “bleeding ochres and rust” and “the negative space of doorframes she no longer passed through” are vivid and precise. That said, figurative language is nearly continuous and occasionally self-conscious (“a vividly descriptive crimson rush”), nudging the piece toward purple in places and leaving little room for plainer contrast. Trimming a few stacked modifiers or on-the-nose adjectives would sharpen impact without sacrificing beauty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise of a traveler who writes “obituaries for the living” and practices grief as intimate cartography feels fresh and thoughtfully realized. Using a single thread as compass, tether, and missing piece in the carpet is an elegant, specific device that reappears meaningfully at the end. The conceptual frame of “explained absences” and mapping vacant spaces synthesizes familiar loss themes into a distinctive angle. It’s not radically experimental in structure, but within a lyric mode it takes real risks in metaphor and conceit that largely pay off.</comment>
