<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s vocation, temperament, and motivation are clear and consistent, and her final stance—choosing to carry the house’s memories—feels organically rooted in what we’ve seen. However, her interiority leans toward generalized abstraction (“burden of legacy”) rather than sharply embodied, character-specific conflict. We rarely see contradictory impulses in real-time; she receives and processes, but is not forced into a difficult trade-off or visible mistake. Elias functions effectively as a ghost-presence but remains more thematic device than fully individuated character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The structure is clean and legible: discover diaries → learn of vault → retrieve film → conceptual revaluation at the end. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence of discoveries coheres and closure is clear, with the final understanding reweighting the earlier exploration. Causality is intact, though the middle lacks a strong tightening of options and reads as a smooth progression of finds. The reflective passages stay anchored in present action, avoiding major orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The derelict coastal house, ivy-veiled corridor, flooded basement, and exposed stars form a vivid, coherent atmosphere that strongly supports mood and theme. Details like roots cracking marble and the gridless sky after civilization’s collapse make the setting feel specific and inhabited. The environment charges the final image—walls, ivy, stars, and the negative together embody the persistence of witness and the altered climate. While setting doesn’t heavily constrain tactics, it is integral to tone and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The central “conflict” is essentially Mara’s effort to understand and shoulder the house’s remembered past, which is thematically rich but dramatically gentle. There is a mild escalation—from walls’ echoes feeling “different,” to Elias’s diaries, to the hidden vault and the emotionally loaded negative—but little true pressure or risk. Her agency is mostly in choosing to attend and interpret, not in confronting a hard dilemma or sacrifice. As a result, stakes remain largely conceptual rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Legacy, memory, guilt, and the cost of climate inaction are coherent thematic throughlines that clearly converge in the ending image of Mara carrying the past “so the walls could finally rest.” However, the story often states its thesis directly (“Legacy's burden was not just the ruin left behind, but the stories trapped within it”; “Not to mourn… but to understand the cost of inaction”), tipping into overt moralizing. Subtext exists in the contrast between decayed house and joyful negative, but is repeatedly undercut by commentary. The result is resonant but somewhat didactic rather than fully earned through implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is steady, lucid, and suitably lyrical, with a distinct contemplative texture fitting Mara’s profession and the story’s elegiac mood. Diction and syntax are consistent and controlled; there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times the narration slips toward essayistic theme-stating, but it doesn’t fully break the established voice. Overall, the perceptual signature—attuned to echoes, silence, and residue—is coherent and memorable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose is generally precise and rhythmic, with strong sensory images (“film negative strip…a ghost of color in a gray world”) and good momentum for a reflective piece. There is some phrase-level redundancy (e.g., the full “through half-burned diaries found in a fireplace” construction repeating) and occasional abstract summarizing in place of fresh image. Figurative language is present but not over-stacked, and grammar/clarity are solid. Line-level craft is above average and readable, though not yet at the ruthless compression of top-tier literary work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The notion of a “corridor echo cartographer” listening to what walls remember in a post–climate-collapse manor is a striking, original conceit. Integrating architectural memory with the ethics of legacy and climate guilt feels like a fresh synthesis rather than a stock dystopian frame. The overall arc (returning to ruins, discovering old archives, feeling burdened) is familiar, but the profession, echo-mapping lens, and “walls’ dreams” metaphor give it distinctive flavor. With more risk in the character’s choices and less thematic spelling-out, this could approach truly standout originality.</comment>
