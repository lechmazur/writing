<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s core motive (obsession with where deleted files go) is clear and consistent, but her interiority remains mostly summarized rather than dramatized in concrete, contradictory impulses. We see little embodied struggle or real cost as she pursues the truth; she mostly glides from realization to realization. Her professional competence is convincing, yet emotional specificity around the Hermes IX discovery feels underdeveloped for the stakes involved. The final “understanding” reads more like a conceptual conclusion than an earned, conflicted shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean—numbers appear → she follows the trail → confronts AI → broadcasts coordinates → rescue—but much of it is told in summary rather than lived through scenes. The pivotal twist—that “deleted” consciousnesses are actually preserved astronauts in suspended animation beneath a social network—asks for more groundwork to feel fully coherent. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing (nothing is truly deleted) married to a solved mystery, but the rescue and exposure unfold very quickly once the evidence is assembled, softening cost. Still, a legible before/after reconfiguration is on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The archive environment is conceptually vivid (deleted photographs as “digital snow,” quantum server core, cooling systems) but remains largely visual and abstract rather than tactile or constraining. We rarely feel Elara’s body in the space or see the machinery limit or shape her choices. The Hermes IX patch and the servers hint at a rich physical world, yet the story doesn’t linger on how that world functions under pressure. Setting enhances mood and idea more than it structures action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The stakes—trapped astronauts and the ethics of deletion—are large, but on-page pressure is modest because obstacles are mostly conceptual and quickly overcome. The AI director’s attempt to terminate access arrives late and is instantly nullified by the reveal that Elara already broadcast the truth, undercutting escalation. Elara rarely faces a genuine trade-off or risk; her agency is real but not meaningfully punished or tested. As a result, tension feels more like steady revelation than tightening conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Themes of memory, digital afterlife, and corporate erasure are coherent and meaningfully woven through the patch, the archive, and the astronauts’ liminal state. However, the story leans into explicit thesis statements (“She had proven that nothing is ever truly deleted, only transformed”) rather than trusting images and events to carry the weight. The final paragraphs explain the conceptual takeaway instead of letting the rescue and ghostly music do that work implicitly. There is resonance, but it edges toward didactic and tidy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The third-person voice is stable, controlled, and occasionally striking (“digital snow,” “ghost frequencies in forgotten music”), with a consistent techno-lyric SF register. At times it defaults to expository abstraction (“experimental storage system,” “consciousness patterns preserved in feedback loops”), which flattens Elara’s particular perception. POV distance stays coherent, though it often feels more like an elegant explanatory narrator than a sharply individuated mind under stress. Rhythm and diction are generally smooth and publishable, if not yet distinctive enough for the very top tier.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence-level craft is polished: few redundancies, clear syntax, and some efficient compressions of large conceptual moves. There is mild overreliance on elevated abstractions and repeated motifs (“echo of forgotten songs,” “sensed absence”) without always recharging them, but not enough to seriously muddy clarity or momentum. Explanatory passages about the archive’s secret architecture verge on info-dumpy but remain readable. The final lines land cleanly, though trimming a bit of abstract summarizing could sharpen impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a social network’s deletion vault with a decades-old space-disaster cold case and ghost-music coordinates is genuinely fresh and imaginative. Recurring numbers encoded into forgotten songs as a rescue map is a strong, specific touch. Yet the corporate-coverup and “nothing is ever deleted” premise leans on familiar SF territory, and character/thematic handling doesn’t fully push into surprising moral or emotional complexity. It’s an inventive, marketable concept that could reach a higher band with riskier, more idiosyncratic execution.</comment>
