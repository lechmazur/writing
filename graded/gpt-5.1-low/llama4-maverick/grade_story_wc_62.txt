<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The carver’s grief, vocational focus, and attachment to her mentor are clear, but they remain largely told rather than dramatized through pressured choices. “Turmoil within” versus outward calm is asserted without many concrete, contradictory impulses in scene. Her final peace feels plausible but arrives via narration and setting rather than a sharply rendered internal struggle. Still, the vocation and family customs give her a specific, non-generic profile.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The structure is a single, continuous scene that accumulates atmosphere until a conceptual shift at the end. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the beats (finishing the carving, ghost’s arrival, poem, butterflies) link coherently to her growing insight. Closure is present as a resonant reconfiguration—she “discovers the shape of collective grief”—but the cost of that shift is only lightly felt. There are no causality breaks, just a fairly low-intensity progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse is vivid and sensorially grounded—mist, tropical plants, lunar glow, and headstones all recur and evolve with the light. The butterfly migration and nocturnal transformation of the space strongly charge the final image and tie directly into the theme of grief and persistence. Setting is firmly filtered through her attention to plants, stones, and ghosts rather than reading like a neutral catalog. It doesn’t much constrain choices, but it deeply shapes the story’s mood and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—her need to understand and reconfigure her grief—is present but faces minimal resistance. Pressure barely tightens: the ghost’s arrival and the poem nudge her inward, yet nothing genuinely threatens her current stance or forces a trade-off. She more or less drifts into acceptance, with no vivid sense of what she risks by changing. As a result, escalation feels static and the ending lacks a palpable price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Themes of collective grief, persistence of beauty, and the interweaving of death and life are coherent and consistent with the imagery. However, they are over-explicitly named (“She had been searching for a way to understand the shape of collective grief”; “It was a shape that was both beautiful and terrible, a reminder…”) rather than left to emerge from scene and image. The butterflies and ribbons offer good symbolic material, but the story often tells us its thesis instead of trusting implication. This produces a gentle emotional aftereffect, but leans toward sentimentality and didactic closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is steady, with a mildly lyrical, reflective tone that suits the meditative content. Diction is generally consistent and free of glaring register shifts or POV leakage. That said, the narrative texture feels somewhat generic—relying on repeated constructions like “The carver felt…”—rather than a sharply idiosyncratic perceptual signature. Under pressure, the voice does not meaningfully modulate; it stays in the same calm register throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prose contains some lovely images (e.g., “soft, lunar glow”; “thundering calm”) and is grammatically clean, but it leans on repetition and scaffolding. Many sentences restate emotional states (“felt a sense of peace settle over her”) with similar phrasing, and there is frequent use of “The carver…” / “As she…” stems that flatten rhythm. Abstract formulations (“shape of collective grief,” “intricate web of life and death”) recur without new specificity, creating a mild sense of looped language. Overall, the momentum is more float than drive, and trimming redundancies would sharpen impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The combination of a gravestone carver, spectral mentor, butterflies, and an ancient greenhouse is a fresh-feeling constellation of elements. The idea of “spectral mentorship” and a craftsperson grappling with collective grief has potential beyond standard ghost-visit consolation. However, the arc itself—a quiet, smoothly achieved acceptance prompted by a natural spectacle—follows a familiar emotional template and avoids riskier or more surprising turns. The ingenuity lies more in image-level choices than in a distinctive narrative or thematic reconfiguration.</comment>
