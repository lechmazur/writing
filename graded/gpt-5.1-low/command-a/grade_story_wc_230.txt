<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s motives (rational control, psychological safety, withdrawal after the empathy virus) are clear and consistent, and his choices—taking the eye, seeking Mara, then returning it—track well with those traits. The involuntary truth-telling creates a credible internal conflict, though it’s only lightly dramatized (one on-page outburst). His final stance about “choosing which truths to carry” feels earned but slightly tidy and thematically worded rather than fully embodied. Mara functions cleanly as a secondary character, but she applies information rather than real pressure on his values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: foraging → discovery of the eye → onset of curse → consultation with Mara → dawn ritual → restored equilibrium. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph, and the single time/space transition to the village is legible and motivated. Closure lands as a Decisive Change—relinquishing the eye and lifting the curse—combined with a conceptual reweighting of truth vs. safety, though the solution unfolds somewhat straightforwardly once the ritual is introduced. The cost is present (giving up the relic and accepting his limits) but not deeply pressed on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The orchard-in-a-ravine setting is vivid and thematically integrated (“fractured grace,” storm-twisted branches, damp air), and the mud-brick village contrasts nicely in mood and texture. Details are filtered through Elias’s work habits and the final return to truffle-foraging neatly echoes the opening with added resonance. However, the environment mostly provides atmosphere and origin/return site for the eye rather than strong physical constraints on choice or movement. The storm damage and ravine are evocative but could pressure action more directly to reach a higher band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The main stake—Elias’s psychological and practical safety under the compulsion to speak truth—is coherent and signaled early, and the eye’s curse offers a solid inciting turn. Escalation is modest: once Mara identifies the object and the ritual, the path to resolution feels relatively unthreatened, with little sense that failure or delay would carry a sharper cost. Internal conflict (fear of keeping vs. fear of leaving the eye) is intriguing but resolved quickly in favor of action without further complications testing that choice. The ritual itself proceeds smoothly, so the peak never quite sharpens into a hard trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Themes of truth, secrecy, and “psychological safety” in a post-empathy-virus world are well aligned with the glass eye’s curse and the orchard’s battered resilience. The final images of buried relic vs. unearthed truffle provide a solid symbolic contrast between dangerous and nourishing secrets. However, the explicit thematic statement (“psychological safety wasn’t about avoiding truths, but about choosing which ones to carry”) leans into moralizing, undercutting some of the subtextual power. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves the thematic question in a relatively neat, articulated takeaway.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent and controlled, with a measured, slightly lyrical register that suits a rational, solitary forager in a strange, wounded world. Diction like “fractured grace” and “psychological safety” pushes toward conceptual but fits the quasi-speculative frame. Mara’s dialogue is simple and believable, and the narration does not slip in and out of other minds. Rhythm varies enough to keep the prose from feeling mechanical, and psychic distance is handled steadily.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is generally tight and purposeful, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“The orchard seemed to exhale, its fractured grace restored”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and not overstacked, and there are few if any paraphrase loops or filler sentences. Information is clearly sequenced, and the ritual and closure read smoothly without syntactic clutter. A few lines tilt toward abstract summary (the final moral sentence especially), but they don’t significantly impede momentum or clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The combination of a truffle forager, a hanging storm-battered orchard, an “empathy virus,” and a cursed glass eye that enforces truth feels fresh and thoughtfully synthesized. The idea of psychological safety reframed through a literalized truth-compulsion relic has genuine conceptual interest. The plot resolution itself is fairly conventional (find relic → learn curse → perform ritual), so structural surprise is limited. Nonetheless, the worldbuilding angle and the fractured-grace tone elevate it above familiar genre templates.</comment>
