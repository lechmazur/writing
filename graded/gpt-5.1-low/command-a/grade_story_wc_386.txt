<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara is clearly motivated and competent, and her role as wreck-diver ghost whisperer is distinctive, but her inner life is more labeled than dramatized (“her motivation burned brighter”) and lacks real contradiction or doubt. We see almost no struggle or friction in her process, so her emotional cost at the end is implied rather than felt. Her choices mainly confirm an existing identity instead of testing or complicating it. The result is solid but not yet deep or cutting enough for top-tier literary characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: find snow globe → go to shrine → use dream method → assemble family story → ritual closure, with the dawn providing a neat temporal arc. The dreams from distant strangers are an effective structural device and are well integrated. Closure lands via a quiet resonant reconfiguration when the globe clears and the family’s names are spoken, though the price of that work is only lightly sketched. The structure is coherent and satisfying but not yet surprising or demanding in its turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Arctic, the glacier-carved, candle-lit shrine, and the “borrowed starlight” atmosphere are vivid and specific, with the ice walls humming nicely tying setting to the supernatural. The melted snow globe functions as a recurring object that meaningfully charges the final image. However, the environment mostly frames mood; it rarely constrains options or alters tactics beyond providing a ritual space. Strong atmosphere and specificity, just shy of using setting as an active pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes are largely conceptual—remembering and honoring a lost family—without substantial on-page resistance, risk, or failure. Elara’s method works smoothly; each dream yields useful information without complication, and there is no adversarial force, ethical dilemma, or time-cost tradeoff that narrows her options. The only escalation is an increase in information and intensity of vision, not in danger or moral weight. This leaves the piece beautiful but relatively low in tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Themes of memory, salvage, and the persistence of distorted yet enduring beauty are coherent and anchored in the snow globe’s evolution from wreckage to briefly restored clarity. The ending’s image—murky liquid clearing to reveal the untouched village as dawn rises—creates a gentle resonance about connection and warmth in cold places. Some lines verge on the sentimental and explicit (“to salvage something pure from the wreckage,” “warmth could be found”), smoothing over complexity. Overall, the thematic arc is clear and honest but not yet surprising or unsettling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The third-person close POV is stable and well controlled, with no head-hopping and consistent access to Elara’s perceptions. The voice has a soft, lyrical texture that suits the material, though it sometimes leans on familiar turns of phrase rather than an utterly idiosyncratic idiom. Rhythms are varied enough to avoid monotony, and the descriptive mode is legible and confident. It’s a pleasant, controlled voice more than a singularly arresting one.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is generally clean, with good rhythm and relatively high information density; most sentences pull their weight in advancing either mood or story. There are some familiar metaphors and abstractions (“life a tapestry woven,” “motivation burned brighter,” “symbol of their home”) and a tendency toward mild purple, but nothing that seriously muddies meaning or momentum. The line-level work carries the atmosphere smoothly to the end without visible scaffolding or loops. It’s strong, if not razor-honed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The combination of an Arctic wreck-diver, a glacier shrine, and a method of ghost work via strangers’ dreams feels fresh and conceptually rich. The melted snow globe as a time-warped key object is a strong, grounded choice that lifts the premise above generic ghost stories. However, once the premise is set, the beats follow a relatively expected path of revelation and gentle closure, without a risky or non-obvious turn in the emotional calculus. The originality lies more in the setup and texture than in the narrative’s development.</comment>
