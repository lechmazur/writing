<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s obsession and cautious hope are clearly motivated and consistent, and her professional lens (charts, frequencies) gives her some particularity. However, internal conflict is underdeveloped: the risky interference feels more inevitable than agonized over, with few in-scene micro-choices showing competing impulses. Relationships (especially with Merrick and the town) are mostly summarized rather than dramatized under pressure. The closing shift to “preparing for the next phase” reads credible but emotionally light given the scale of what she’s done.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: months of analysis → recalibrated transmitter → interference → signal blackout → social easing and institutional acknowledgment. The structure (night operation plus a compressed “over the next week” aftermath) is straightforward and legible, with a clear before/after. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Charged Poise: Elara has altered the game and now stands at the threshold of an ongoing struggle. The main weakness is that key consequences (town tensions easing, Merrick’s reversal) are summarized rather than given any concrete scene pressure, softening the sense of cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The university radio station is vividly evoked—vintage equipment, humming studio, blue light, trembling charts—and the atmosphere supports the eerie, secretive tone. The setting’s specifics materially enable the plot (old analog gear that can be modified for subsonic frequencies, late-night solitude). Cosmic alignments and off-world constellations broaden the world without derailing focus. Still, the environment rarely constrains her choices beyond “this is where the gear is,” so it charges mood more than tactical decision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—humanity’s perceptual autonomy versus the tricksters’ manipulation—is clear and high. Pressure rises into the interference attempt, with stated risks of equipment damage or attracting alien attention, and the brief destabilization in the room hints at danger. But the operation proceeds almost entirely according to plan, with no meaningful complication or trade-off; the major option foreclosed or price paid never quite materializes on the page. The later social easing and Merrick’s approach arrive as clean wins rather than outcomes with visible, felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Themes of manipulation through media, the fragility of community cohesion, and power plays across scales (cosmic and institutional) are coherent and emerge from events. Elara’s lonely resistance versus the faculty’s credulous “Enlightenment Project” offers a solid thematic spine about perception and authority. However, several thematic ideas are told in explicit thesis-like lines (“strategy of conquest through division,” “weren’t benevolent messages”) rather than allowed to accrue through implication. The ending hints at ongoing, morally complex power struggles but doesn’t quite reweight prior material in a surprising way.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The close third-person (with a slight omniscient tilt) is stable and appropriate, and the scientific-contemplative register fits Elara’s role. Diction and rhythm are generally controlled, with some nice textural touches (“whispers in between signals,” “invisible fingers”). There are mild generic turns of phrase and explanatory sentences that flatten intensity, but no major POV leakage or register jolts. The voice is competent and coherent rather than uniquely distinctive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prose is clean and mostly economical, with clear sequencing and minimal syntactic clutter; technical terms are used accessibly. Some phrases lean on familiar shorthand (“sleep had become a luxury,” “hairs… stand at attention”), and there is light redundancy in summarizing Elara’s obsession and the community’s division. Figurative language is present but not over-stacked, and it rarely obscures sense or cause/effect. Overall, the line-level work supports the story without drawing much attention to itself, but it lacks the compression and freshness expected at elite-publication level.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The mashup of campus radio, analog equipment, and cosmic tricksters manipulating human perception is a moderately fresh angle on alien-signal tropes. The idea of conquest-through-division via subtle frequency control has conceptual promise and thematic relevance. However, character dynamics (the dismissed Cassandra scientist, the credulous mentor, the town tensions) and the clean success of the interference feel familiar and somewhat template-driven. The piece plays it formally and emotionally safe, with solid but not strikingly inventive turns.</comment>
