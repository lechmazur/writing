<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s core motivation (solving the cold case via deleted files) is clear and consistent, and her professional role gives her plausible competence. However, her interiority leans on generalized formulations (“brightly attentive,” “forbidden knowledge”) rather than sharply individuated thought or contradictory impulses under pressure. The pivotal choice to risk her career/freedom reads emotionally thin—there’s little felt hesitation or conflict before she lies and hacks access. The ending positions her as a determined crusader, but the cost is asserted more than embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The causal chain is coherent: noticing anomalous absences → decoding the 731 pattern → breaching restricted sectors → uncovering the Stellaris truth → fleeing with evidence. Closure functions as a clear Decisive Change plus Charged Poise: she downloads what she can under alarms and disappears into the underground, with the case and conspiracy reconfigured. That said, several key beats are summarized rather than dramatized (e.g., the hacking window, the security response), which blunts the sense of mounting jeopardy. The structure is clean but feels more like an outline of a thriller scene than a fully realized one at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The “social network archive” as a “digital necropolis” is a strong atmospheric frame, with restricted sectors and grayed-out interfaces that concretely shape Elara’s options and risks. The recurring Stellaris patch and the hidden coordinates give the setting a layered, investigative feel rather than a white-room abstraction. At times the diction leans generic-cyber-gothic (“ghosts in the machine,” “malevolent eyes”), which dilutes distinctiveness. Still, the environment meaningfully constrains choice (access levels, timers, alarms) and charges the final image of her escape.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—risking career/freedom and confronting a massive suppression of truth—is clearly signaled, and the lie/hack sequence is the central tightening. However, the ninety-second access window and security threat are mostly told rather than felt; there’s no concrete obstacle or reversal beyond “alarms began screaming,” so escalation stays abstract. Elara never faces a sharp moral or practical dilemma once she commits; the only real option is “break rules and investigate,” which fits her established drive but limits tension. The stakes are big in premise but lightly dramatized on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of memory, erasure, and institutional control over truth emerge organically from the archive, the missing researchers, and the revelation that “deleted” files go “everywhere.” The recurring motifs of absence, ghosts, and forgotten songs support a meditation on who gets remembered and who is erased. Some lines state the theme a bit baldly (“The archive doesn’t lie, but people do”; “ensure that nothing… could successfully delete the truth forever”), nudging into thesis rather than letting image and situation carry it. The final configuration is resonant but more schematic than piercing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is stable and confident, with a consistent elevated, slightly noir-tech register that suits the material. Elara’s perceptions (“digital necropolis,” “ghosts of the forgotten”) give the prose a recognizable texture, even if they occasionally feel conventional for the genre. There are no POV slips or awkward tense shifts, but the narrative sometimes lapses into generalized, slogan-like phrasing that feels more authorial than character-specific. Overall, the voice is competent and coherent, just shy of the sharp distinctness top venues demand.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose is fluent and mostly clear, but it leans heavily on familiar metaphors and intensifiers (“silent scream,” “ghosts in the machine,” “static electricity of forbidden knowledge”), creating a purple, slightly repetitive surface. Several sentences restate the same emotional or atmospheric point with marginal new information, which slows momentum at this length. Rhythm and syntax are varied enough, yet information density could be higher if some ornamental language were pared back. For an elite market, the line-level work would need tightening and more original figurative choices.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The combination of a corporate memory keeper, social-network necropolis, and a conspiracy around a supposedly crashed ship offers a fresh enough angle within familiar SF-thriller territory. The idea that “deleted” data is actually dispersed and hidden “everywhere” is conceptually interesting and thematically aligned. However, many beats (secret project, doomed spaceship that didn’t crash, powerful interests erasing knowledge) feel like recognizable genre scaffolding rather than a singular, idiosyncratic vision. The story shows promise but doesn’t yet push its premise or character in unexpected, inimitable ways.</comment>
