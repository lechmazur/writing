<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Her drive to reclaim sound and her embodied grief/hope are vivid and consistent, with strong use of gesture and sensory deprivation to individualize her. However, internal conflict is relatively simple—she rarely seems genuinely torn or at risk of giving up—so her final triumph feels emotionally linear rather than hard-won.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The structure is clean: single scene, clear goal, and a logical progression from setup (experiment) to payoff (thermal “music”). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she cannot recover hearing but forges a new language—yet the path there is smooth, with “she worked for hours” eliding struggle and cost, softening the impact of the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory and its frost/orchid imagery are atmospheric, specific, and sustained, and the tools (tuning forks, scanner) are well-integrated into the environment. While the setting functions more as charged backdrop than active constraint, it meaningfully charges the final image of her “stage” and aligns tightly with the tone and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether she can create a new form of music from silence—is clear, but pressure escalates only mildly. “She worked for hours” skips over potential failure or doubt beats, so the experiment’s eventual success feels somewhat inevitable rather than wrested from real resistance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Themes of resilience, adaptation to loss, and redefining “music” are coherent and arise organically from her actions and tools. However, the closing lines (“The world had taken her hearing, but she had given it a new song”) verge on spelled-out thesis, nudging the piece toward sentimentality rather than leaving more work to subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with controlled rhythm and a clear perceptual signature filtered through a deaf protagonist. Some diction leans generic or repetitive (“unshaken marvels,” “silence”) but not enough to break the voice’s confidence or clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is generally strong, with clean syntax, vivid images, and good momentum for a contemplative piece. There is some mild repetition and purple edging in phrases like “phantom symphony of chaos” and reiterated formulations of filling/rectifying silence, but these do not materially obscure sense or undercut the closing image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fusion of post-catastrophic silence, thermal emotion-mapping, and a glass conservatory of orchids feels fresh and specific, giving the piece a distinct conceptual identity. The emotional trajectory (trauma to near-untouched triumph) is more familiar and tidy, limiting how surprising or complex the resolution feels despite the inventive premise.</comment>
