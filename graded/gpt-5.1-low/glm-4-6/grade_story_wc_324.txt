<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Aria’s core traits—curiosity, compassion, competence—are clear and consistent, and her profession-specific mindset gives her some individuality. However, she faces almost no real internal conflict or cost; she is never truly torn between options or values. Her “persistently curious nature” is stated rather than deeply dramatized through contradictory impulses. The result is a likable but relatively low-pressure interiority that doesn’t fully earn the weight of the closing gratitude.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: devices → anomalous pulses → intensified signals → music-box compartment → documentary revelation → decision to inform authorities. Structure holds as a single investigation scene with a clear midpoint escalation (stronger pulses) and a concrete reveal. However, several key beats—especially the discovery and reading of the documents—are summarized rather than dramatized, softening impact and cost. Closure is present (truth uncovered and a new course of action chosen) but feels a bit mechanically tidy and low-friction for the material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium, twilight, and thinning boundary between worlds create a coherent, mood-rich atmosphere that fits the premise. Specifics like the stone bench, tablet screen, and old music box give just enough texture without clutter. Yet the setting is largely decorative: the atrium and mist do not materially constrain tactics or alter choices, functioning more as a gothic backdrop than an active environment. The final tonal reweighting of the atrium’s “reeling hush” helps, but still leans on telling rather than embodied interaction with place.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering Margaret’s unfinished truth to protect a silenced sister—is clear and thematically aligned. There is one significant tightening when the pulses suddenly intensify, signaling urgency and leading to the hidden compartment. But Aria experiences almost no resistance or risk; the investigation progresses linearly with no real possibility of failure or meaningful sacrifice. As a result, tension is modest and escalation feels more procedural than pressured, keeping the conflict below elite level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Themes of listening to the unheard, intergenerational abuse, and the ethics of truth-telling are organically embedded in the premise. However, the final paragraph leans heavily into explicit statement (“incidental heroism,” “truth would protect even the most vulnerable voices”) rather than letting images and choices carry the resonance. This drifts toward moralizing and blunts what could have been a more hauntingly ambiguous or quietly devastating ending. The concept is strong, but the articulation lacks subtlety and leaves little interpretive space.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The close third-person POV on Aria is stable and consistent, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. Prose is fluent and readable, with occasional nice turns of phrase and a coherent speculative-investigative tone. Still, the narrative voice feels somewhat generic for such a high-concept world; diction and rhythm rarely surprise or cut sharply enough to feel singular. Authorial commentary creeps in around the theme, slightly flattening the character-specific perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is generally clean: grammar is solid, sequencing is clear, and most sentences pull their weight. There is some redundancy (“persistently curious nature,” repeated thematic formulations) and occasional abstraction (“incidental heroism,” “protect vulnerable voices”) where concrete image could do the job. The prose edges toward purple in places but never quite tips into muddle; it remains legible if somewhat over-explanatory. Overall, it’s competent and smooth but short of the compression and precision expected in top-tier venues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The idea of a “contact tracer for hearts” reading emotional imprints through a deaf woman’s hearing aid is a genuinely fresh and intriguing twist on ghost detection. The combination of emotional residue, assistive tech, and institutional abuse is promising and feels more than templated genre play. However, the investigation structure (posthumous revelation of family abuse, hidden documents clearing the wronged relative) is familiar and handled in a relatively straightforward way. The story shows notable originality at the premise level but doesn’t fully exploit its strangest, most idiosyncratic implications.</comment>
