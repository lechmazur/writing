<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The gazer’s motivation—relief from a lifetime of unspent affection—is clear, specific, and consistently drives his choices. Interiority is rich and character-particular, especially his fixation on “where” unused love might be stored and his comfort with abstract spatial thinking. Internal contradiction is present but soft: he is desperate yet oddly clinical in his inquiry, and we don’t see much simultaneous push-pull beyond fear vs. curiosity. The final repricing of his own “unused love” as contribution rather than burden feels earned by the preceding obsession and vision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The structure is a clean single scene framed by one decisive act—performing the psychometry reading—that causally leads to his conceptual discovery. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the build from booth description to sensory immersion to metaphysical vision is coherent and progressive. Closure lands as a clear Conceptual Repricing: he learns unused love is stored in “whens,” and this reconfigures his understanding of his life with a legible emotional cost. There are no orientation or lens-clarity problems, and the scope is well matched to the length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The projection booth, film, and “hushed thunder” of the unseen auditorium are vividly evoked and tonally aligned with the story’s liminal concerns. Details like aged film, ozone, and the hum of the projector feel particular and lived-in rather than touristic. However, the environment mostly serves as atmosphere and metaphor rather than truly constraining options or shaping tactics; he could almost conduct this reading anywhere with the strip. The setting does subtly charge the final image through the cutting-room-floor metaphor but stops short of being structurally indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The central stake—whether he can locate and thus emotionally reframe unused love—is clear and present from early on. Pressure builds primarily through intensifying inner experience (the unresolved melody, the spiraling crescendo) rather than through antagonistic force or hard choices. There’s one meaningful deepening when he realizes love is stored in “whens,” but there is little on-page resistance, risk, or trade-off beyond the fear that his love will vanish unarchived. The result is thematically potent but somewhat low in felt jeopardy or escalation for a “prestige” short piece.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Thematic integration is strong: outtakes as “goodbye letters,” love as temporal residue, and the cutting-room floor of reality all braid into a coherent meditation on unrealized affection. The final realization that his own unused love is a contribution to an archive, rather than a private burden, reweights every prior image. Subtext operates through film-editing metaphors and the humming pockets of time, inviting reflection on regret, potential, and memory. The last paragraph edges close to explicit thesis (“not a burden to be carried, but a contribution”), but it remains anchored enough in image and character to avoid feeling like pure moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in spatial and temporal metaphor. Diction (“editing-room floors of reality,” “moments of their non-existence”) is elevated but believable for this particular, slightly mystical technician of images. The narrative distance stays stable, and there is no POV leakage or unmotivated exposition. While the prose sometimes skirts purple, the rhythm and register are under control and well suited to the contemplative mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose is generally strong, with vivid figurative language and good information density—many lines do double duty for atmosphere and concept. Phrases like “outtakes from a lost musical,” “a tune for which forgotten lyrics searched endlessly,” and “editing-room floors of reality” are memorable and apt. There is some mild redundancy and tendency toward stacked metaphors (thunder, storms, echoes, incubating) that push the boundary of overwriting but rarely obscure sense. Line-level rhythm is varied and clean, with no major scaffolding, syntactic monotony, or clarity failures.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of psychometry, film outtakes, and the metaphysics of unused love stored in discarded moments feels genuinely fresh. Treating emotional surplus as archived on the “editing-room floors of reality” is a striking and non-obvious conceptual move. The piece commits fully to this vision and follows its implications through to a resonant revaluation of the narrator’s life-long burden. It’s not formally radical, but within a conventional frame the imaginative and thematic choices are distinctive and memorable.</comment>
