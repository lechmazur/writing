<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marcus’s motivations are clear and consistent—professional duty, weariness, and “inadvertent stubbornness” driving him to risk his life and sanity to mend the lens. Interiority is specific enough to feel individual, especially in lines like his fixation on giving “rest a permanent address.” The internal realization about why spirits refuse to settle is earned by the ordeal, though the emotional contradiction (his own inability to rest vs. his service to the dead) could be pushed even harder on the page. Secondary on-page character pressure is minimal (Mrs. Hargrove is mostly off-stage until the end), keeping this largely a solo interior crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: package → obsession with the lens → research into Mirrormere → dangerous dives → underwater ritual → functioning lighthouse for the dead. The structure handles a big temporal span through compact summary (“Six weeks and three life-threatening diving expeditions later…”) without losing orientation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Marcus succeeds in sending others “home” while remaining restlessly in-between, a before/after that’s legible and costly. The main structural limitation is that the high-risk expeditions are told rather than partly dramatized, slightly softening the sense of tightening constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting work is vivid and purposeful: the basement workshop, the old lighthouse, and especially the underwater city library are all textured with concrete, imaginative detail (“fish darted between bookshelves like curious librarians”). These environments constrain choices—he must dive to Mirrormere for knowledge, endure “crushing depths,” and then mount the lens in the lighthouse for it to function. The lighthouse lens as recurring object charges the final image of ghost-visible golden pulses. A slight bias toward the visual over other senses keeps this just below the very top tier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—guiding lost souls to rest versus Marcus’s own inability to find stillness—is established early and followed through. Conflict escalates from an apparently unfixable object, to research into forbidden knowledge, to multiple “life-threatening” dives, to the painful, liminal ritual of existing in “impossible spaces.” The cost is credible but somewhat undercut by being mostly summarized (we do not feel a specific dive or failure, only hear about them in aggregate). The internal conflict at the climax is strong conceptually but could use one sharper, on-page moment of hesitation or near-break to fully peak the pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of rest, address, liminality, and the ethics of helping others move on while remaining unsettled oneself are woven consistently through the object (lens), profession (undertaker), and imagery (“permanent address,” “chased stillness”). The notion of distress signals for the dead instead of the living is an elegant thematic inversion that shapes both plot and final image. Marcus’s insight about why spirits refuse to settle emerges from experience, not pure abstraction. There is some repeated, near-thesis language around “permanent rest” that edges toward explicitness but doesn’t quite tip into sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is steady and controlled, with a slightly formal, melancholic register that fits a veteran undertaker and the story’s metaphysical ambitions. Phrasing like “fractured like frozen lightning” and “one must occupy simultaneously existing spaces” feels of a piece with the tone without sliding into academic or clinical diction. Psychic distance holds consistently to Marcus’s perception, and the few lines of dialogue (Mrs. Hargrove’s final whisper) are spare but effective. There are occasional abstract formulations that could be grounded more in bodily experience, but they don’t break POV or rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is polished, with varied syntax and generally high information density—most sentences advance both world and character. Figurative language is controlled rather than piled on, and key metaphors (frozen lightning, seafoam, chased stillness) are coherent and thematically aligned. There is minor conceptual repetition (“weary undertaker,” “permanent address,” “stillness”) but it reads as motif rather than scaffolding. Nothing at the line level obscures causality or dulls the ending; the final sentences land cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The combination of a funerary professional, a broken lighthouse lens for the dead, an underwater city library, and the metaphysical technique of occupying “impossible spaces” feels fresh and thoughtfully synthesized. The story commits to its speculative logic and follows implications—distress signals as guidance for restless spirits, a beacon seen only by those with “one foot already in another world.” The emotional arc (a man who can send others home but not himself) is archetypal but made specific through the chosen images and profession. A bit more idiosyncratic psychological detail or a formally riskier structure could push this into truly exceptional territory.</comment>
