<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation (to locate the stored, unused love and the lost tune) is clear and consistent, and her interiority is vivid and particular (“feel the weight of the unsaid”). Her competence in psychometry and comfort with liminal spaces feel character-specific rather than generic mystic traits. Internal contradiction is lighter—she rarely seems genuinely torn, mostly serenely committed—so the emotional cost of her pursuit could deepen. The final choice to lean into the burning vision and promise “I’ll bring the tune back” feels earned but not sharply conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece follows a clean arc: extended waiting, psychometric contact with the film, vision of the star/composer and the storage-space for love, then the projector’s activation and Mira’s transcription. Causality is mostly accumulative-textural but still coherent: handling the film leads to visions which lead to the conceptual “storage place” which triggers the booth’s response. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Mira moves from searching to actively retrieving the song—but the sense of price paid is relatively soft. Structural focus on a single scene with embedded backstory keeps orientation solid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Orpheum projection booth is richly and economically realized—celluloid and dust, dormant gears, the physicality of the reel all feel lived-in and tactile. Setting is not mere backdrop: the booth’s liminal quality justifies her presence, shapes her method, and the projector itself becomes an active agent in the climax. The idea of a “vast, echoing cavity behind the screen” elegantly extends the setting into metaphysical space. The final image—projector light casting lyrics on the wall—leans heavily and successfully on the environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unlocking the lost tune and the stored unsent love—is clear, and pressure does build from quiet waiting to trembling booth to burning film and self-activating projector. However, the conflict remains mostly conceptual and internal; there is little sense that failure or psychic overload would carry concrete consequences beyond disappointment. Mira’s choice to lean into the intensifying, even destructive vision is a meaningful tightening but not deeply contested. Tension is present but could be sharpened by more explicit risk or friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of where unspent emotion goes, how art and love persist, and the storage of what’s unsaid are well-embedded in objects and images (reel, booth, unsent letters, “unused songs”). The recurring question “Where do the songs go when the music stops?” and the conceptual “storage place” behind the screen give the piece a satisfying conceptual unity. At times the text drifts toward overt statement (“Mira believed those letters didn’t vanish”), slightly reducing the need for reader inference. The ending offers a quietly resonant non-literal answer—the songs were here all along, needing someone to listen—without turning into explicit moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is confident, lyrically inclined, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in how Mira notices liminal pockets and emotional residues. Syntax and rhythm vary well, and the “hushed thunder” register feels intentional and sustained without slipping into exposition-voice. Filter verbs and explanatory sentences are minimal, and psychometric phenomena are rendered through image rather than explanation. The voice could risk a bit more sharpness or idiosyncrasy at peak pressure, but it is already strong and controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: sentences tend to do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without obvious redundancy, and metaphors (“like the shudder of a held note finally released”) largely cohere and stay on motif. There is some density of figurative language but it rarely feels purple or muddled, and rhythm adapts to quieter and more intense moments. No clear scaffold, loops, or mechanical cadences drag momentum. A few abstractions (“a vast, echoing cavity”) brush against vagueness but are grounded quickly enough by context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The fusion of crystal-gazing psychometry, a decaying movie palace, and the metaphysics of unsent love letters and forgotten songs feels fresh and thoughtfully integrated. The notion of emotional residues stored in a “space behind the screen” reimagines familiar liminal-space tropes with some originality. While individual components (haunted cinema, lost silent film, mystic artifact reader) are recognizable, their combination and execution give the story a distinct flavor. The piece doesn’t take a radical structural risk, but its conceptual angle is sufficiently non-obvious to stand out.</comment>
