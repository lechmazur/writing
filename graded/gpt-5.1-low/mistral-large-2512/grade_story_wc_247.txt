<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lena’s grief, relationship to silence, and desire to be seen are specific and consistent, and Elias’s quiet support is clear, but their inner contradictions under pressure are only lightly sketched. The strongest moment is her continuing to “map” silence despite past erasure, yet we don’t see a sharply conflicted impulse (e.g., to withdraw vs. to reach). The relationship dynamic is tender but largely untested, so it never quite becomes a crucible. The final sense of change—feeling seen—is earned but relatively gentle and low-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural drive is coherent: harbor → memory of being forgotten → present act of composing silence → ending where she keeps going and feels seen. Causality is soft but intact: her choice to stay, compose, and accept Elias’s presence leads to a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration. Structure is clean—a single scene with one reflective inset—and orientation is solid from the outset. The main limitation is the absence of a more sharply defined turn where options or stakes visibly narrow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The luminous harbor is vividly rendered and recurs as her refuge, backdrop for “mapping silence,” and charged final image. Details like “waters shimmering like scattered silver” and the smell of salt and rain are sensorially rich and clearly filtered through Lena’s sensibility. While the harbor doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, it does thematically mirror and hold her emotional state, especially as the place she went when “no one remembered her.” The closing image of the harbor glowing brighter effectively charges the resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Lena’s need to turn grief and silence into a form of connection—is clear but under-pressured. The main tightening is her choice to keep composing when she could withdraw, encouraged by Elias’s “Keep going,” yet that decision doesn’t feel materially costly in the moment. External conflict is minimal; Elias is supportive rather than oppositional, and no specific risk, rejection, or loss is brought into the foreground. As a result, tension remains gentle and never fully sharpens into a test of values.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of grief, being forgotten, and transforming silence into meaningful connection emerge organically from motifs like the emptiness between stars, the camera without film, and signed “music.” The idea of “joyful sorrow” is nicely embodied in the harbor as both refuge and site of ongoing ache. Some phrasing edges toward abstraction or conceptual labeling (“perform grief,” “translate silence into music”) but generally stays tethered to concrete scene. The final sense of being seen reweights earlier loneliness without collapsing into explicit moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The close-third voice is controlled and lyrically consistent, with a clear perceptual bias toward light, reflection, and touch. Elias’s sparse spoken lines contrast well with Lena’s silent, gestural language, giving the dialogue a subdued, natural rhythm. The narration avoids head-hopping and maintains a stable stance, even when briefly summarizing past weeks of erasure. While the voice is graceful rather than startlingly distinctive, its modulation toward a benedictive cadence at the end is skillful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is polished, with mostly clean metaphors (“words curling into the night like smoke”) and a good balance between lyricism and clarity. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, and description generally does double duty for atmosphere and emotion. There is minor redundancy (e.g., variations on silence and light) but not enough to stall momentum or blur sense. The final lines land with a clear, charged image rather than abstract summary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Conceptually, using sign language as composition and a film-less camera as a tool for framing emptiness is a fresh, resonant set of choices. The “mapping silence” motif gives a distinctive angle on familiar themes of grief and being unseen. However, the emotional arc itself—harbor as refuge, a gentle companion, moving from loneliness to feeling seen—remains within well-traveled territory and doesn’t quite risk a surprising turn. The ingenuity lives more in the image system than in structural or conflict-level innovation.</comment>
