<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lena is sharply sketched as a “forgiving skeptic,” and her choice to stay, return to the garden, and follow the map is coherent and grounded in that trait. Her interiority is specific (“kept it not for luck, but for proof”), and her final acceptance of the changeling feels earned. However, genuine internal contradiction is underplayed—she rarely wavers or feels torn, so the emotional cost of her choice remains muted. The changeling itself is more symbolic than individuated, which flattens the relationship’s crucible potential.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The structure is clean: discovery of the second tooth leads to the ritual, to the map, to the maze’s center, to the encounter and return—a coherent causal chain with a clear before/after. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the drive lens (largely causal with a lyric overlay) holds through closure. The main structural weakness is how smoothly the ritual works and the maze cooperates, minimizing friction or complication and reducing perceived cost. Closure still lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Lena + child emerging with a secret), but with a relatively gentle edge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The garden and hedge maze are vivid and integral: the hidden space, damp earth, unnamed flower colors, and apple tree roots all feel tactile and lived-in. Setting is not postcard decoration; it shapes options—the garden is literally where rules bend, where teeth are found, where the ritual can happen, and where the child is kept and then released. The recurring objects (tree, teeth, maze) charge the final walk back with clear resonance. A bit more environmental constraint or obstacle during the maze traversal could have pushed this into the top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding and/or reckoning with the real child/changeling, and setting the town’s “wound”—is clear and thematically apt. There is one meaningful deepening when the ritual produces a map and Lena must choose to follow it to the center. But opposition is almost entirely absent: the garden is cooperative, the maze unfolds easily, and Lena faces minimal risk, pushback, or moral dilemma beyond a generalized atmosphere of fear and secrecy. As a result, escalation feels more like a graceful unveiling than a tightening of pressure with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of second chances, fear of the strange, and “turning mistakes into constellations” are woven through Lena’s choices, the town’s history, and the recurring tooth/garden imagery rather than stapled on. The ending—keeping the truth partially hidden while embracing the changeling—offers a nuanced answer about what repair can look like without sermonizing. A few lines verge on explicit thesis (“Her motivation was simple: to turn mistakes into constellations”), which slightly blunts the subtext. Even so, the piece invites reflection on how communities treat the different and how private acts of repair matter.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct sensibility (“a cleft in certainty,” “colors no one had names for”) that feels tied to Lena’s way of seeing. Small bits of dialogue are natural and economically loaded, especially the changeling’s line “Because they didn’t know how to keep me. But you do.” The narrative distance is well controlled, moving smoothly between external action and interior reflection without confusion. There’s a slight tendency toward uniform lyric elevation, but it fits the mode and doesn’t disrupt clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, dense with meaning, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is fresh and coherent (“like a star trapped in enamel,” “the garden…a cleft in certainty”) and rarely overdone, sustaining atmosphere without purple blur. Information is efficiently packed so that nearly every line advances character, setting, or theme. A handful of abstract formulations could be sharpened into more concrete embodiment, but they don’t materially dull momentum or the closing image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The fusion of a changeling tale, hedge-maze secret garden, and bone-setting/tooth magic feels distinct and thoughtfully realized rather than templated folklore pastiche. The idea of “turning mistakes into constellations” and using teeth as star-like anchors for a map is an especially memorable inflection. The story doesn’t radically reinvent form or stakes, leaning into a familiar quiet-fable shape, but within that frame it offers a singular atmosphere and concept. With sharper conflict or a more surprising moral calculus around the changeling’s fate, it could push into a higher originality band.</comment>
