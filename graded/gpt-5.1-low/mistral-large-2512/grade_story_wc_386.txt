<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara’s vocation, skepticism, and ethical orientation are distinct and consistent, and her final refusal to reveal the truth grows plausibly from the “salvager of echoes” who “weaves truth carefully.” However, her internal conflict—between exposing the quartermaster and honoring the dead’s desire for silence—remains mostly conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized in scene. The week-long investigation is summarized, so we never see her values tested moment-to-moment. The ending endurance/renunciation is convincing but could land harder with more embodied ambivalence under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation is clean from the outset (Mara, shrine in glacier ice, the snow globe), and the causal chain—vision of wreck → dream visitation → investigation via descendants’ dreams → revelation of sabotage → decision to keep silent—is coherent. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with an accumulative textural overlay from the dream fragments. Closure works as an Earned Stasis: she forecloses the path of public revelation at visible ethical cost, and the snow globe’s final activation seals the arc. Some middle beats (the week of tracking) are compressed into exposition, but they serve the structure without breaking pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glacier shrine and melted snow globe provide a vivid, specific atmosphere; details like fogged glass, iced walls, and “borrowed starlight” feel integrated rather than decorative. The shrine functions as a micro-setting that frames her work space, ethical “confessional,” and the final charged image with the snow globe tear. While the physical environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactical choices, it does shape the metaphysics (dead in the ice, candles and fire altering relics). The recurring setting-object pairing (shrine + globe) meaningfully charges the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The central stake—whether Mara will use this window to drag buried truth into the open or respect the dead’s wish for silence—is clear and sharpened by the reveal that the red-coated woman is a saboteur, not a victim. There is one strong deepening turn when the investigation reframes the quartermaster and the ship’s sinking as deliberate harm, reweighting Mara’s ethical calculus. However, much of the conflict is off-page and reflective; interviews and dream-gathering are summarized, so escalation feels more intellectual than immediate. The final choice to “never tell” is a real foreclosure but lacks a concrete, external test in the scene itself.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story develops a nuanced theme around truth, complicity, and the ethics of remembrance—whether all truths deserve daylight or some wrecks must stay buried. Recurring images (windows of connection, the snow globe, the red coat) steadily shift meaning toward a conceptual repricing of revelation as potential violence rather than automatic good. Lines like “The dead didn’t want justice. They wanted silence.” and “Ask the ones who lived.” crystallize this tension without fully collapsing into didactic moralizing. The resonance is strong, though a touch more subtlety around those explicit statements could push it even higher.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, confident, and textured, with phrases like “salvager of echoes” and “borrowed starlight” giving it a memorable timbre. POV distance is well controlled; we stay in Mara’s perceptions and lexicon without intrusive authorial explanation. The sparse dialogue (with the red-coated woman) is clean and charged with subtext, advancing theme and closure. A few explanatory sentences in the middle lean more into telling than the surrounding lyricism, but they don’t significantly disrupt voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is lean yet evocative, with strong image economy and minimal redundancy; nearly every sentence carries character, world, or thematic work. Metaphors are coherent and integrated (melted snow globe as window, wreck in the bloodline, “truth burns too bright”) without slipping into purple excess. Rhythm varies well between longer, lyrical sentences and short, declarative beats at turns like “Mara didn’t believe in accidents.” There are no notable scaffolding loops, syntactic monotony, or line-level confusions that drag momentum or blur the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The combination of a wreck-diver medium, an ice-shrine office, and an investigation conducted through inherited dreams feels fresh and specific, not like a genre template with new nouns. The sabotage twist and the dead’s preference for silence invert expectations about ghost stories and justice in an interesting way. While the core truth-vs-silence question is familiar, the particular configuration of objects (melted snow globe), methods (cameo dreams), and setting gives it distinctive texture. It’s inventive and memorable, though not yet at the level of startlingly original or risk-heavy experimentation.</comment>
