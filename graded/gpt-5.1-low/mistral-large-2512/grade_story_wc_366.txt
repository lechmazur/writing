<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias is clearly motivated by grief, duty, and reticence; the sea glass as talisman and his history with anonymous notes give him a concrete emotional engine. His key choices—coming to the lighthouse just for the glass, deciding to answer via stones, lighting the lamp, and finally leaving the glass—align cleanly with those motives. The inner conflict (silence vs answering, clinging vs letting go) is present but relatively understated, which keeps the arc from feeling fully knotted or risky. The realization about what haunts the lighthouse is a bit tidy but still earned by prior beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The structure is tight and legible: one continuous visit framed by prior note arrivals, with each on-page development (stone spiral, first reply, new note, lamp lighting, final rearrangement) causally following the last. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, with pattern-building rather than hard reversals, and the closure—Elias leaving the glass and descending while the lamp burns—lands as a resonant reconfiguration with emotional cost. Causality holds; nothing feels teleported or retrofitted. The only limit is modest external pressure, but for this quiet design it’s sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse and lantern room are vividly rendered—“bruised twilight,” “ghost of light, a luminescent ache”—and consistently filtered through Elias’s seafaring, grief-weighted perspective. The environment and recurring objects (lamp, sea glass, stacked stones) directly charge the final image; the room’s supposed haunting is reinterpreted without needing extra exposition. Spatial and atmospheric anchors are clear and economical, with no white-room moments. The setting doesn’t aggressively constrain physical options, but it strongly shapes mood and meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Elias remains sealed in solitary ritual or opens to a living, ongoing chain of caretakers—is clear from early on and tightens as the stones elicit a response. The escalation is internal but distinct: discovery of deliberate signaling, the act of replying, the uncanny reciprocation, and then the choice to light the lamp and leave his talisman behind. That final renunciation carries a visible cost given how the glass has been framed. The conflict remains largely contemplative, so tension is present but quiet rather than gripping.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of safety, remembrance, and shared guardianship (“haunted by the living”) emerge organically from the imagery of light, notes, and stones, and the ending reweights the premise effectively. However, several lines veer toward aphorism—“The sea remembers what we forget,” “The lamp is just a tool. The light was always in you.”—which edge into stated thesis rather than fully subtextual resonance. The emotional aftereffect is genuine and gentle, not saccharine, but the piece does tip into overt statement more than an elite venue would accept. The conceptual frame is strong; its articulation could be slightly less on-the-nose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and aligned with Elias’s taciturn, sea-marked sensibility, with clean control of distance and no head-hopping. Diction choices like “reticent,” “luminescent ache,” and “warmly observant” create a recognizable texture without drifting into an alien register for this world. The inserted letter lines feel like a distinct but coherent sub-voice and advance mood and theme. Rhythm varies well at key beats (lamp lighting, stone rearrangement) to underscore emotional turns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is polished and economical, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character; images like “bruised twilight” and “carried it like a talisman against the dark” are vivid and apt. There is some repetition in the aphoristic note lines, but it reads as intentional patterning rather than scaffolding. Syntax and paragraphing are clear, with no confusion in sequence or pronoun reference. Occasional near-purple touches are restrained enough not to blur meaning or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The piece takes a familiar lighthouse/ghost frame and freshens it through the anonymous note chain, stone-language, and the idea of a place haunted by the living rather than the dead. The sea glass as a personal talisman that becomes a communal beacon is a specific, memorable inflection. While the overall arc (grieving caretaker learns he’s not alone) is not radically new, the execution feels particular and sincere rather than templated. It’s inventive within a classic mode, though not quite at the level of startling originality.</comment>
