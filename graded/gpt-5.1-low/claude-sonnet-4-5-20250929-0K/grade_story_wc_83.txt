<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s grief, scientific obsession, and survivor’s guilt are specific and coherent, and details like the geode gift and her sensor modifications root her motivation in concrete history. However, she faces little on-page dilemma or contradictory impulse in the present; most conflict is pre-decided (she’s already committed to the hunt). Interiority is textured and embodied (“palm against the frost-rimed window,” the memory of her cousin’s laughter) rather than generic. The relationship with Dr. Vahedi is sketched but not heavily stressed, functioning more as validation than as a crucible under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The piece runs as a single continuous scene with interleaved backstory, oriented cleanly in time and space, and it maintains an Accumulative/Textural drive rather than a strongly causal one. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: by the end, Mira’s ongoing “hunt” is reframed as her awakened way of being, with the circuit breakers’ readiness echoing her own. There is no major plot turn, but the anomaly detection and thruster adjustment provide a modest tightening that justifies the final charged poise. Cost is conceptual and emotional rather than event-based, but it’s legible in her acceptance of a life lived in that liminal search.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The floating observatory, polar stratosphere, aurora, and ionospheric instruments are vividly rendered and tightly filtered through Mira’s perceptions, giving the piece a distinct atmosphere. Setting is not just decorative: the ability to drift between poles and monitor quantum fluctuations is what lets her pursue her metaphysical “hunt,” and the aurora’s imagery charges the final image of pooled potential. The geode functions as a micro-setting object that recurs meaningfully. Environmental detail is economical yet specific, with consistent world rules and no white-room moments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mira’s need to understand and locate “unused potential” to metabolize her loss—is clear, but pressure remains mostly internal and static. The anomaly detection and course correction constitute a mild escalation, yet they don’t force a new trade-off or foreclose an option; they confirm her existing path rather than testing it. There is little resistance, ethical friction, or risk beyond the implied psychic cost of her obsession. As a result, tension is more contemplative than felt as conflict, which limits the category.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—how potential, loss, and small perturbations shape reality—is woven tightly through the geode, perturbation theory, the wedding strike, and the atmospheric anomalies. The final image of “unused potential, pooling like light inside unopened stones” reweights the earlier scientific and personal material in a satisfying conceptual repricing. However, some thematic statements are on-the-nose (“Energy couldn't be destroyed, only transformed”; “The potential doesn't disappear”), slightly reducing subtlety. Despite this, the emotional aftereffect is strong and avoids reductive moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct blend of scientific lexicon and lyrical metaphor that plausibly fits a traumatized atmospheric researcher. Diction like “probability clouds,” “quantum foam,” and “bleak exhilaration” feels character-appropriate rather than authorially imposed. Dialogue is sparse but natural, and Vahedi’s line about “ghost hunt” nicely underplays the depth of Mira’s preoccupation. Psychic distance is well controlled, with smooth shifts between sensory immediacy and conceptual reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, carry multiple jobs (image, theme, character), and rarely feel redundant. Key metaphors (geode/potential, aurora as “wedding veils catching fire”) are vivid and coherent, and the prose largely avoids purple excess despite operating in a lyrical register. There is some repetition of abstract terms like “potential” and “perturbation,” but not to the point of loopiness or drag. Information flows clearly without scaffoldy exposition or noticeable template cadences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The fusion of climate science, perturbation theory, quantum probability, and personal trauma into a search for “unused potential” is a fresh and memorable angle. The geode as a metaphor for hidden crystallizations of reality, and the idea of tracking probability-density “ghosts” of unrealized futures, goes beyond standard grief or SF tropes. Risks are taken in leaning into conceptual, almost metaphysical stakes rather than concrete plot, and the piece commits to that vision. A bit more structural risk or a sharper turn could push this higher, but it already feels distinct and publishable.</comment>
