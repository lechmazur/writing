<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara is specific, consistent, and her motive—to understand why some houses feel alive—organically drives her collecting and altar-making. Her “creeping normality” perception is dramatized in concrete observations, not just labels. Internal conflict is relatively soft (she’s not deeply torn so much as seeking), so the final reframing of her “gift” feels earned but low-cost. A touch more contradiction under pressure would push this higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story is cleanly structured as one accumulating scene with a brief, well-anchored backstory inset, moving from beach to Kettering house to realization. Causality is clear in an accumulative/textural way: collecting → arranging → hush → house “exhale” → conceptual shift. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing (what houses “need”), but the cost is more implied than sharply felt, which keeps it below top-tier. Orientation is excellent from the first paragraph, with no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bay at dusk, the tideline, and the Kettering house are vivid, tactile, and consistently filtered through Mara’s noticing. Setting details like the “streetlights blinked awake” and “spring air went still” aren’t decorative; they modulate tone and charge the final image of the house “holding light like a promise.” The micro-setting of the windowsill altar and specific found objects also function as a kind of emotional architecture. The environment doesn’t tightly constrain physical choices, but it deeply charges the atmosphere and ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The central stake—Mara’s need to make sense of living vs hollow houses and what her perception is “for”—is clear but kept at a gentle simmer. Pressure does deepen when the hush falls and the house “exhales,” forcing a new stance on her ability, yet there’s little resistance or real risk to her tactics. The escalatory move is primarily conceptual rather than conflictual, which works for a lyric piece but limits felt stakes. A more concrete cost or tension (social, psychological, or supernatural) would strengthen the conflict band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of displacement, witnessing, and gradual change accumulate through the found objects, the gentrifying pier, and the empty Kettering house. The idea that “houses didn't need people…they needed witness” is powerful and resonates backward through the images. However, the story edges into explicit thesis-stating (“Her creeping normality wasn't a curse but a gift”) rather than fully trusting image and action. The result is still strong, but slightly more told than the highest tier would permit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is confident, rhythmic, and distinctly tuned to Mara’s way of noticing, with recurring attentiveness to small shifts and repurposed objects. Metaphors like “streetlights blinked awake” and “a shard of hush” feel voice-driven rather than generic lyricism. The therapist mention and “creeping normality” label flirt with contemporary diagnostic language but are grounded in scene and character. POV is stable with no leakage or helping-narrator overreach.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length and rhythm, images are precise, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but mostly well-controlled and coherent, rarely tipping into purple; phrases like “caught in their dreaming state between utility and decoration” earn their keep. Information density is high—most lines advance both atmosphere and character—and the piece reads smoothly aloud. A few abstract phrases (“constant noise of existence”) are minor soft spots but don’t materially dull the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The idea of sanctifying abandoned houses with displaced seaside detritus so they can “exhale” under the gaze of a hyper-attentive protagonist is fresh and memorable. The reframing of houses as beings that need witness, not inhabitants, feels like a non-obvious synthesis that fits the images. While the lyric-haunted-house mode is familiar, the specific combination of beachcombing relics, creeping normality, and quiet quasi-magical activation feels distinctive. The piece takes a stylistic risk with its hushed, almost devotional tone and largely succeeds.</comment>
