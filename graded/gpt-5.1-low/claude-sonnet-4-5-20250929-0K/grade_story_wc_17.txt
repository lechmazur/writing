<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maya’s motivation—answering her grandfather’s question and testing his apparent “madness”—is clear and consistently tied to her profession and temperament. Her interiority feels specific (reading emotion in echoes, the satchel as unwanted legacy), but genuine inner conflict is more implied than dramatized in concrete choices under pressure. The note that her sensitivity makes her “terrible at ignoring what others dismissed” hints at a powerful flaw/cost, yet the story never puts her in a moment where that trait truly complicates a decision. The closing stance shift (from proving to “dreaming with” the walls) is earned but relatively low-friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The structure is clean: arrival in the ivy-veiled passage, discovery in the library, proof via diaries/negative, and a return to the passage with a reweighted understanding. Causality is intact—her search leads to the fireplace, the fireplace to the diaries, the diaries to the negative, the negative to her realization. The closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing: the rules of the world (walls dreaming forward, ivy as nervous system) are reframed and her mission redefined, with the emotional cost of inheriting an isolating obsession. Stakes remain internal and quiet but coherent for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and integrated: the drowning city, climate-altered ivy, and abandoned university library all feel tactile and particular. Acoustic perception (“corridor echo cartographer,” buildings’ “slow, ancient respiration”) filters details through Maya’s expertise, sharpening atmosphere. The ivy’s evolution into a “nervous system” that links structures and the passage’s final “exhale” both charge the closing image and theme. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain her tactical choices, it meaningfully shapes the story’s logic and mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The primary conflict is internal and conceptual—can Maya confirm what walls “dream” and reinterpret her grandfather’s legacy—but it escalates mainly through new information rather than hard trade-offs. Discovering the diaries and especially the film negative (showing her in the room) provide a clear tightening of pressure, transforming abstract theory into undeniable proof. However, the piece largely sidesteps visible cost or a sharp dilemma; choosing to continue his work is framed as a near-inevitable acceptance rather than a fraught decision. The result is thematically satisfying but somewhat low-tension in dramatic terms.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme—legacy, perception, and the reciprocity between human memory and architecture—is well woven through recurring motifs (echoes, walls dreaming, the satchel, ivy as nervous tissue). The story gracefully shifts from “are the walls dreaming?” to “can she participate in those dreams?”, reweighting her grandfather’s obsession from madness to visionary burden. The final paragraphs verge on explicit thesis (“She wasn’t trying to prove walls could dream. She was learning to dream with them”), slightly flattening subtext into statement. Nonetheless, the emotional and conceptual aftertaste is strong, and the theme arises organically from events and images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The close third-person POV is stable and well calibrated, with narration colored by Maya’s acoustic and spatial preoccupations. Diction and imagery (acoustic signatures, ghost-pressure, buildings “participating” in history) create a distinct, mildly lyric voice without drifting into abstraction. There is no head-hopping; access to knowledge stays plausibly bounded by her perceptions. Rhythm modulates effectively between atmospheric description and key turns like the moment she recognizes herself on the negative.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is polished and efficient: most sentences do double duty by advancing scene, worldbuilding, and interiority simultaneously. Figurative language is controlled and coherent (ivy as nervous system, buildings dreaming forward) rather than piled on; there are no evident loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic monotony. Pacing remains smooth despite the reflective mode; exposition folds naturally into action (e.g., learning about her profession through her present work, not infodumps). Line-level work fully supports the closure image without obscuring it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The central conceit—a “corridor echo cartographer” in a climate-transformed city listening to buildings that dream forward—feels fresh and thoughtfully extended. The integration of altered ivy as neural network, walls storing future echoes, and proof via a film negative of the protagonist herself is an inventive synthesis rather than a gimmick. Emotional stakes (inheritance of a lonely, dismissed obsession) keep the piece from being merely conceptual. While echoes of weird-architecture fiction exist, the specific blend of acoustics, climate change, and intergenerational burden reads distinctive and publication-ready.</comment>
