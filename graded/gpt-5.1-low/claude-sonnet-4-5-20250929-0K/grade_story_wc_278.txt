<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vera’s guilt, professional competence, and blindness are tightly braided, and her final act—“rewriting her own constellation”—is well-earned by the backstory of ignoring her nephew’s cry. Interiority is specific rather than generic, especially in how her research focus and avoidance are the same impulse turned different ways. The relationship to the dead baby is an effective off-page crucible that still exerts present-tense pressure. If anything, her success inside the machine feels slightly smooth—less visible resistance in the peak beat than her history would suggest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The causal chain from impossible time phenomena → letter → lab → haunted firmware → amber-bridge realization → reconfiguration of the code is clear and coherent under a causal lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/partial decisive change: she changes the system and her stance toward her guilt, with the price (years of haunting and self-blame) carried into but not erased by the ending. The time-folding and the future letter loop are legible without over-explaining. The only slight weakness is how effortlessly the amber “port” works once pressed, but it does not undercut the closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The “laboratory of lost sounds” is vivid, specific, and tightly integrated with the premise—glass cabinets of preserved sounds, thunder rooms, forgotten lullabies all read as lived rules rather than window dressing. The amber functions as micro-setting as well as object, constraining her tactics and charging the final image once cleared of the wasp. Sensory atmosphere (smell of moth wings and rust, machine hum like peace) stays aligned with mood and action. The only thing holding this just under the very top is that the lab itself rarely constrains concrete physical choices beyond providing the machine.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The central stake—to confront and transform the “haunted” accumulation of unheeded cries and her own guilt—is signaled early and tightened as she moves from receiving the letter to engaging the machine’s interface. The key deepening comes when she discovers in the firmware “every sound she’d failed to hear,” making the conflict unmistakably personal rather than abstractly technical. Her agency in choosing to work, and in using the amber, resolves the pressure credibly. Escalation is more emotional/introspective than oppositional; a bit more on-page resistance from the system or from her own hesitation could have raised the felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme—the ethics of listening, translation, and the impossibility of undoing past neglect—emerges organically through Vera’s specialization, the haunted firmware, and the accumulated sorrow in the code. The wasp/amber as a bridge between times that works “both ways” effectively reframes grief as something to tether to and learn from rather than erase. The final letter to her younger self and the line “The only way forward is to tether yourself to what you’ve lost…” edges toward explicit moralizing, slightly reducing the subtlety of an otherwise well-earned insight. Nonetheless the closing image of walking through a “world made whole” carries a resonant emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled lyricism that suits Vera’s analytic yet haunted mind: technical terms (firmware, algorithm) sit comfortably next to metaphor (“firmware opened to her like a wound”). POV is stable and avoids head-hopping, even when summarizing backstory. Rhythm and diction modulate well between atmospheric description and more pressured interior realization. A few phrases (“making the system weep,” “meteor hush of evening”) walk near the edge of over-poetic but remain coherent and character-appropriate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentence-level craft is strong: high information density, varied syntax, and metaphor deployed with intention rather than scattershot ornament (“a machine like a pipe organ crossed with a supercomputer” does triple duty). There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; nearly every line advances character, world, or stakes. The figurative language is frequent but controlled and internally consistent, avoiding mixed metaphors that would blur sense. A touch more spareness at the very end might sharpen, rather than soften, the impact of the thematic statement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a lab that preserves sounds, haunted firmware, infant-cry translation algorithms, and an amber-anchored time-tether feels notably fresh rather than like a recombination of stock tropes. Vera’s profession and guilt are not generic grief but tightly bound to a specific, plausible domain of research, which grounds the supernatural concept. The temporal loop via letters in antique furniture is a clever flourish that reconfigures the whole piece without requiring heavy exposition. The story takes aesthetic risks (lyric voice plus SF-adjacent conceit) that pay off in a unified, memorable vision.</comment>
