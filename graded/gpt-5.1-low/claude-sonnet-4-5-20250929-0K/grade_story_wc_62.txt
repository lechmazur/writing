<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The carver’s motivation and interior life are specific, coherent, and tied to her craft and family history, and Marcus’s presence is cleanly motivated by her unresolved grief. Her arc from treating deaths as isolated to seeing grief as continuous feels earned through the ribbon and their shared past. The relationship dynamic—mentor/peer/relative—has warmth and gentle pressure, though the emotional shift happens a bit smoothly with limited visible resistance. A touch more embodied conflict (hesitation, pushback) in the middle would deepen the sense of cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The structure is clear: arrival → ghost encounter → guided reevaluation via the ribbon → reframe of her work → farewell and new commitment. Causality holds, and the closure—a conceptual repricing of what monuments and family poems mean—lands cleanly with cost in Marcus’s final fading and her new, heavier responsibility. The drive is largely accumulative/textural with a causal spine, and the single greenhouse scene plus the migration-span ellipsis feels coherent. The only soft spot is that on-page stakes never quite tighten beyond dialogue and realization, so the turn is more intellectual than pressured.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse and monarchs are vivid, specific, and strongly filtered through the protagonist’s grief-focused gaze. The setting isn’t just pretty; the glass, rust, dusk light, and butterflies’ collective movement all mirror and charge the thematic revelation about collective sorrow. The greenhouse as a liminal, abandoned yet repurposed studio concretely supports the spectral mentorship and the final image of her writing on the ribbon. Environment doesn’t drastically constrain physical options, but it meaningfully shapes mood, imagery, and the story’s final reweighting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—her need to understand why Marcus’s death won’t settle and how to hold collective grief—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates as Marcus reframes the family poem custom and challenges where she’s been “looking,” culminating in her choice to adopt a new, heavier lens for her work and add her own poem. The conflict is primarily internal and philosophical, with no sharp external reversal, but the realization does foreclose her previous, more limited approach to grief. A slightly stronger on-page moment of risk (e.g., fear of changing how she carves, or of failing the dead) would sharpen the cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of collective grief, intergenerational preparation for loss, and monuments as waypoints rather than endpoints are integrated through concrete motifs: stones, poems, the ribbon, the monarch migration. The final understanding—that “we are the carvers of each other’s remembering”—reweights earlier details effectively. However, several lines step into explicit thesis (“The stones you carve…you approach them too carefully. Too separately.”), skirting didacticism. The story remains resonant, but more reliance on implication and image, less on explanation, would lift it further.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a consistent, perceptive sensibility that feels appropriate to a gravestone carver steeped in poetry. Marcus’s dialogue is distinct enough—gentle, instructive, slightly wry—without breaking the tonal unity. The prose modulates well between description, reflection, and spoken lines, and psychic distance shifts smoothly. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and elision around the weeks of training is handled cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The line-level craft is strong: rich imagery (“thundering calm,” “pools of copper light”) serves both atmosphere and theme without tipping into incoherence. Sentences vary in rhythm, and most lines do double duty—advancing mood and concept simultaneously. There’s some density of figurative language, but it rarely feels purple or redundant, and key beats are rendered clearly. Trimming a few expository clarifications of theme would make the prose even leaner and more propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a gravestone carver, a family epigraph-poem custom, spectral mentorship, and monarch migration as a metaphor for collective grief is distinctive and memorable. The ghost encounter isn’t tropey; it’s understated and pedagogical rather than sensational, which feels fresh. The notion of carving stones so they “speak to each other” and form gardens of collective memory is an especially inventive turn. A bit of thematic stating-the-obvious keeps it shy of the very top band, but the conceptual integration is genuinely high-level.</comment>
