<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Margot’s characterization as a pattern-obsessed, ethically serious escape room designer is clear and consistent, and her final refusal feels motivated by that core value. Her interiority is specific—she thinks in terms of puzzles and patterns—but the emotional experience skews conceptual rather than deeply embodied. The central conflict between curiosity and protection of her creative space is present, though it could be pushed harder on the page. Still, her choice to drop the seed and mobilize others reads as an earned endurance/renunciation rather than a neat epiphany.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal spine is clean: mysterious envelope → research → realization of sabotage → choice at the brook, with a clear before/after in her stance toward the “puzzle.” The piece maintains single-POV, one primary scene, no orientation issues, and the closure (refusing the coordinates and deciding to warn others) is on the page with an Earned Stasis feel. Stakes are mostly conceptual/professional rather than viscerally dramatized, which keeps escalation modest. Nonetheless, setup elements (seed, coordinates, obsession with puzzles) pay off coherently at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cottage, brook, moonlight, and post-storm air create a tangible nocturnal atmosphere that aligns well with the story’s quiet, reflective tension. Details like the worn deck and brook’s murmur are economical and grounded in Margot’s perspective. The environment slightly constrains choice by making the brook an immediate, plausible disposal method, but it mostly serves mood rather than pressure. Still, the final image of moonlight on the water gives the setting a gentle, resonant role in closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The main pressure—whether to follow the coordinates and indulge the mystery or to reject it to protect her creative sanctuary—is clear and tight. The realization that the seeds are a long-game sabotage against puzzle designers is a meaningful deepening of stakes. Escalation remains primarily internal and intellectual, with limited sense of risk or loss beyond the conceptual, so tension never fully peaks. Her decision to discard the seed and commit to warning others is a genuine narrowing of options, albeit with relatively low on-page cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme—about protecting spaces of innovation and recognizing that some “puzzles” are traps—is coherent and organically linked to Margot’s profession and choice. However, several sentences in the final third (“She would help them understand that some mysteries weren’t meant to be solved…”) verge on stated moral rather than purely emergent resonance. The corpse flower as a metaphor for corrosive obsession is strong but a bit under-exploited subtextually. Overall the piece invites reflection on curiosity and sabotage but leans slightly didactic at the end.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The third-person-limited POV is stable, and the narrative lexicon matches an intelligent, pattern-focused adult comfortably. The voice has some texture—e.g., “orthogonal approaches,” “hush of a possibility just born”—that hints at Margot’s puzzle-designer mind without drifting into overt abstraction. It’s not a highly idiosyncratic or unforgettable voice, but it’s controlled and consistent. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and psychic distance remains appropriate throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sentences are generally clean, with varied rhythm and few redundancies; information density is good, and most lines serve multiple functions (mood, character, and plot). There is some mild purple phrasing (“storm-born silence,” “hush of a possibility just born”) but it does not obscure sense or derail momentum. Expository passages about other designers and the sabotage pattern are concise enough not to bog the scene. No major loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddles touch the closure, and the final image is clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise—weaponizing a years-long corpse flower cultivation as a psychological sabotage against escape room designers’ creative bandwidth—is striking and fresh. Tying this to the meta-idea of puzzles as potential traps for innovators provides a non-obvious, conceptually rich angle. The structural moves themselves are conventional, and the ending choice is straightforward, but the synthesis of escape room culture with botanical sabotage feels distinctive. With slightly more daring in dramatization or moral complexity, this could push into a higher band.</comment>
