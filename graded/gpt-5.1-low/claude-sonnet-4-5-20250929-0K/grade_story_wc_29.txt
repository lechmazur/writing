<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s vocation, perception of the tricksters, and decision to “interfere” are clearly motivated and consistent, and her competence feels earned rather than hand-waved. However, her interiority stays relatively stable—there’s little contradictory impulse beyond cautious worry vs. determination, so we don’t see her pushed into a genuinely costly or morally fraught choice. Emotional embodiment is solid but somewhat generalized (“cautiously hopeful…felt dangerous”) rather than sharply character-specific. The ending offers an earned endurance/stance more than a transformation, which fits but limits depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: campus phenomena → recognition of converging signals on the tower → Mara’s subsonic gambit → tricksters reorient and campus tension eases. The drive lens reads as largely Causal with a mild accumulative texture from the campus vignettes, and closure lands via a Decisive Change in the entities’ approach plus a Resonant Reconfiguration of the “game.” Cost is on the light side—Mara “buys time” with no clear sacrifice beyond risk and strain—so the before/after is structurally sound but not searing. Orientation is impeccable: who/where/when and stakes are clear early and never wobble.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The university radio station, observatory, and labs are sketched with enough specificity (transmitter hum, charts, tower, surveillance feeds) to feel concrete and functional, not just decorative. Setting is filtered through Mara’s technical and sensory biases (subsonic ache, frequency mapping), which helps atmosphere and plausibility. The environment constrains tactics—the radio tower is the vector the tricksters want, and the station is her only leverage. More tactile, lived-in details in the booth under pressure could elevate this further, but as-is it’s strong and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing the tricksters from leveraging the station to scale chaos—is clear and coherently pressed through the piece. Escalation appears in the converging signals and mounting campus weirdness, and Mara’s choice to run the subsonic-laced track is the main tightening. However, most of the “power plays” and campus division are summarized rather than dramatized, and the solution works on the first attempt with no apparent loss or hard trade-off. The conflict feels smartly conceived but emotionally and tactically slightly under-tested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of chaos vs. pattern, negotiation with incomprehensible powers, and reframing conflict as “a different game” emerge organically from Mara’s work and the entities’ behavior. The final image of the charts reconfiguring into a spiral pulling away, plus the warmer “laughter,” reweights the premise toward coexistence-through-ingenuity rather than victory. There’s welcome resistance to a neat moral—these beings still treat reality as entertainment, and she’s only bought time. That said, the piece stops short of a deeper, more surprising human cost or moral compromise that might linger longer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a nice blend of technical register and lyric flourishes (“beings who experienced time as humans experienced light”). Elision is minimal and never confusing, and POV modesty is appropriate—Mara infers the tricksters’ nature rather than stating omniscient fact. The rhythm and diction modulate slightly with pressure (e.g., when the lights flicker and charts lift), though not dramatically. The voice is polished and cohesive, if not yet idiosyncratic enough to be unmistakable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sentences are clean, well-paced, and information-dense; there’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. Figurative language is sparing but effective, with no mixed metaphors or purple overreach, and technical terms are used confidently without lapsing into textbook exposition. Momentum is well maintained despite some summary, and the climactic beat (lights flicker, charts levitate, pattern shifts) lands clearly on the line level. It’s very solid craft that could be heightened with a touch more compression or surprise at key lines.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—cosmic tricksters manipulating reality through radio frequencies, met by a DJ’s subsonic counter-game—is a fresh and engaging inflection on campus SF/weird fiction. Specific touches like circuits rearranging into “laughter” and the entities finding her musical puzzle more interesting than chaos avoid generic alien-contact beats. Still, the emotional and ethical terrain is relatively safe; Mara’s gambit is clever but doesn’t force a truly unsettling or transformative choice. It’s inventive and coherent, with room to push further into risk or strangeness.</comment>
