<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Petrov’s interior life is specific and convincing: the exiled tutor who “fidgets productively” and reads the world as a chessboard is sharply drawn. His guilt over the duchess and his gradual reframing of that failure grow organically from the present action of decoding the tapestry. The final renunciation of the labyrinth is motivated and feels like a true, if quiet, cost. The main limitation is that his internal conflict resolves a touch neatly, with relatively little ongoing contradiction at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The causal line is clean: Petrov studies the tapestry → decodes the message → understands the nature of the labyrinth and the freeze → reinterprets his exile and chooses a different stance. Orientation (who/where/what’s wrong) is established early and never wavers, and the time-resume beat is well placed as a structural hinge. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis, with his decision not to descend functioning as a real, if understated, decisive change. The only slight limitation is that external stakes remain conceptual rather than felt as active peril or deadline.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The frozen village, suspended rain, and guild hall with the tapestry are vividly concrete and filtered through Petrov’s sensibility. The time-freeze and thunder are not just backdrop; they define the story’s tempo and charge the idea of “fierce repose,” especially when the first raindrop breaks the spell. World rules around the freeze and labyrinth feel internally consistent and are conveyed through image rather than exposition dumps. The setting strongly shapes tone and theme, though it constrains mood more than literal tactical choices, which keeps this just under the 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Petrov will remain imprisoned by his guilt or find a different relation to his past—is signaled clearly and deepens as he decodes the tapestry. Pressure escalates texturally: the increasingly legible code, the nearer thunder, and the dawning realization about the labyrinth’s purpose all narrow his inner options. His climactic choice is to relinquish the quest for treasure/redemption and accept a quieter, cost-bearing stasis, which is earned. What holds this below the top band is that tension stays meditative and low-intensity throughout; there’s no strong sense of risk that his insight might fail or be refused.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of imperfection, forgiveness, and the value of “mistakes in the fabric” arise naturally from the tapestry metaphor and Petrov’s history. Recurring images (threads, labyrinth, frozen time) reweight themselves meaningfully by the ending, especially in the line about “the moves that chess never taught—how to forgive the player behind the pieces.” However, the thematic articulation sometimes tips into explicit statement (“The weavers had known that perfection was sterile…”) that edges toward moralizing. That slight over-clarity flattens some of the potential lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinctive texture shaped by Petrov’s chess-inflected perception. Rhythm and diction are largely well-judged, mixing concrete image with reflective abstraction in a way that suits the contemplative mode. There is no POV leakage or confusing stance shift, and the occasional elevated phrasing (“fierce repose,” “conceptual cost of forgiveness”) still feels in-character for a cerebral exile. A few summarizing lines at the end lean toward editorial explanation rather than pure character voice, which trims the score slightly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythm, high information density, and generally strong image choices (“a thousand silver needles refusing to fall”). Reflection and description mostly pull double duty as scene-setting and thematic framing, so momentum rarely stalls. There are minor instances of conceptual repetition and abstract phrasing, particularly in the explanatory lines about the village’s “capacity to forgive itself,” that feel a notch less vivid than the best images. Overall, though, there are no serious artifacts, loops, or muddled metaphors to undercut the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a time-frozen village, a disgraced chess tutor, and a coded tapestry guarding not treasure but the communal capacity for forgiveness is fresh and memorable. The “woven hush” concept and the reimagining of a labyrinth as a repository for a social/emotional function, rather than a hoard, feel non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth around failure and self-repricing is handled with specificity rather than generic uplift. The core insight—imperfection and loss as groundwork for later growth—is familiar enough to keep this shy of the highest band, despite the inventive vehicle.</comment>
