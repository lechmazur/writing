<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Helena’s blend of hyper-analytic coping and genuine, embodied grief is specific and consistent (“When their marriage ended, she'd made spreadsheets”), and her micro-choices—salvaging scales, building a taxonomy out of ruin—align cleanly with that trait. The arc from seeking de-dramatized beauty to accepting loss and quiet transformation feels earned, with visible cost in the wrecked greenhouse and dead butterflies. Internal conflict (analysis vs presence) is present but subtle rather than dramatized as a sharp in-scene clash, keeping this just shy of the highest band. The humility at the end reads as a credible deepening rather than a tidy fix.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The structure is a clean, single-POV, single-location day that moves causally from aftermath (searching) to methodical salvage (collecting, analyzing) to conceptual closure (walking home under pulsars). The drive lens is accumulative/textural: each pass over butterflies vs neutron stars tightens the central question of how she relates to change and loss. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration as she reframes decay and gradual change, with the price of that understanding legible in the ruined greenhouse and vanished butterflies. There are no orientation or causality slips, and the quiet build feels deliberate rather than static.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The storm-damaged greenhouse, shattered glass, waterlogged plants, and later the open sky with identifiable pulsars create a vivid, coherent physical and conceptual environment. Details are filtered through Helena’s dual lenses of science and caretaking, so microscopes, slides, and wing scales feel lived-in rather than touristic. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices beyond providing what can be salvaged, but it decisively charges the final image of scales “like stars,” binding space and earth. Weather and flood damage meaningfully color tone and stakes without bogging down in description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake is Helena’s need to find a workable relationship with loss and change, signaled early and carried through her salvage work. Pressure is primarily internal and accumulative: moving from shock and cataloging reflex to a more vulnerable engagement with what the scales mean. The key tightening is her shift from mere documentation to insight via pattern-reading, culminating in her decision to rebuild the greenhouse and start again, which forecloses a path of paralysis. Escalation is gentle and textural rather than sharply turned, which fits the piece but keeps pressure in the mid-high band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of decay-as-transformation, catastrophe vs gradual change, and the tension between analysis and presence arise naturally from neutron stars, butterflies, and flood damage. The repeated comparison between pulsars and scales earns its weight through concrete particulars. However, several sentences voice the theme a bit directly (“Decay was just transformation observed patiently”; “The comparison wasn't frivolous”), creating a slight sense of authorial summarizing. The final image still resonates, but the explicitness trims some of the potential subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The close third-person voice feels coherently anchored in a scientist who thinks in precise images and analogies (“a teaspoon would weigh a billion tons,” “microscopic mirrors”). Diction is consistent with Helena’s education and temperament, and the narrative distance remains stable, easing between external action and reflective interiority without leakage. Rhythmic control is strong, with longer, meditative sentences supporting the contemplative mode while remaining legible. Occasional expository phrases edge toward essayistic, but they still sound plausibly like her mind at work.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is clean, vivid, and purposeful, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (character, setting, and theme) without visible scaffold or loops. Figurative language is controlled and thematically aligned, returning to light, weight, and transformation without feeling repetitive or purple. Syntax and paragraphing create a natural rhythm that supports the quiet accumulation of insight. A few lines lean into explicit explanation, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or blur the closing image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of neutron star research, butterfly husbandry, and flood aftermath as a meditation on gradual vs catastrophic change feels fresh and specific rather than templated. Using wing dust and pulsar spin-down as parallel records of existence is an original and memorable angle. The emotional arc—processing grief through scientific methodology and arriving at humility—is familiar but rendered with enough idiosyncratic detail to stand out. Risks are taken in committing to a quiet, conceptually driven story, and they pay off in a strong, coherent close.</comment>
