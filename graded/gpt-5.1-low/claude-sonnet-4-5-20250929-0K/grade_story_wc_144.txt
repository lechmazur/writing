<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara’s competence, adaptation to blindness, and ethic of repair are sharply drawn and consistent, and her methods feel specific to her. However, she experiences little genuine struggle or internal contradiction under pressure; she is almost serenely flawless. The line “She was a heartfelt artisan…” leans on summary rather than letting behavior fully carry that trait. The relationship with Voss is functional but remains fairly surface-level, serving more as foil than crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: a malfunctioning drone before launch leads to diagnosis, repair, and a quiet thematic closure with the hummingbird flying true. The single-scene structure is well-contained, with the ship’s departure horn providing a clear temporal spine. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration around brokenness and perception rather than a decisive change, but it’s legible and earned. The main weakness is that the resolution comes with little real cost or complication, softening impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The misty, abandoned rail depot with water features is vivid, atmospheric, and tightly filtered through Mara’s non-visual perception. The environment directly shapes her tactics (using water, pipes, and acoustics in place of sight) and charges the final image of her fingers in the flowing water. Details like “cathedral silence” and “railway bones” deepen tone without feeling like a catalog. Setting and objects (water, pipes, depot, mist) all participate in the thematic and practical logic of the story.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The external stake (fix the drone before the ship departs) is clear and time-bounded by the horns and anchor, and Mara’s insistence “You’re not leaving yet” is a concrete beat of agency. However, the repair proceeds with minimal resistance; the “compromised” guidance and time pressure never truly threaten failure. Internal tension—her relation to damage and blindness—is interesting but not strongly dramatized as conflict. The result is a pleasing but relatively low-temperature escalation arc.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of brokenness, alternative ways of seeing, and repair-as-redemption are coherent and rooted in the concrete particulars of Mara’s shop and methods. The recurring water/refraction motif nicely embodies the idea of a “different kind of light.” However, the explicit line “being broken and being blind were just different ways of seeing the world” veers into on-the-nose moralizing, flattening ambiguity. The piece leans toward sentimentality at the end instead of fully trusting its images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The close third-person voice around Mara is controlled, with consistent sensory emphasis on sound, touch, and temperature that suits her blindness and trade. Prose rhythm is varied and confident, and dialogue is natural, if occasionally expository. There are a few generic or editorial-feeling intrusions (“She was a heartfelt artisan,” “heartfelt precision”), but they don’t break POV. Overall, the voice is distinct and steady even under the mild time pressure of the scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, fluid, and purposeful, and many carry dual loads of atmosphere and information. Repetition is mostly functional, though a few phrases (“heartfelt artisan,” “heartfelt precision,” “making the broken world whole”) edge toward cliché or scaffolding. There’s little figurative muddle; metaphors like “railway bones” and “cathedral silence” feel apt and controlled. Minor telling intrusions slightly dull momentum but do not seriously obscure causality or the closing image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise of a blind repairer using water and acoustics to “see” for optical drones in a misty rail depot is fresh and memorable. The integration of occupational detail (water features, refraction, acoustics) with theme elevates this beyond a generic “broken things can be fixed” parable. The main familiarity lies in the comfortingly neat emotional arc and stated moral; it avoids real risk in the resolution. Still, the conceptual synthesis of blindness, light via water, and machine guidance is notably inventive.</comment>
