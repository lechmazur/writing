<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is specific and grounded—her “confident uncertainty,” the worry-stone pen habit, and her reaction to the records rewriting themselves all feel psychologically consistent. Her shift from interpreter to co-author of the signals is clearly motivated by accumulating evidence and by her need for meaning. The internal conflict is mostly conceptual rather than viscerally fraught, so the cost of her final stance is more implied than felt. Still, the arc from skepticism to acceptance is earned and legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The piece follows a clean causal/accumulative line: routine signal → anomalous coordinates → archival check → reality edits → conceptual leap → decision to write. Orientation is clear early (Mara, Kepler Station, the anomaly), and the anomaly’s “pulse” acts as a hinge into the altered-records section. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: Mara reconceives the station as a bookmark between drafts of reality and chooses a new role. The cost of that choice remains largely abstract, but the before/after is unmistakable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kepler Station’s anomaly and the high observatory tower are sharply evoked and consistently filter Mara’s perceptions—the sideways tug, flickering screens, and drifting coffee cups all feel lived-in. The setting isn’t mere backdrop; the anomaly is redefined as a “bookmark” and directly charges the final premise that the station sits “in the margin between drafts of reality.” The fountain pen doubles as a micro-setting object that constrains gesture and thought. World rules around the anomaly and signals stay coherent at this length.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how Mara responds to evidence that reality is being retroactively edited, and what that means for her work—is clear and escalates once her own logs change. The pressure heightens when she realizes her predecessor was right and that her filtering habits have been erasing “the universe’s own editing marks.” Her final agency—choosing to catalog and then actively “helping to write” the signals—resolves the internal conflict. However, tension stays mostly intellectual; we never see a sharply framed loss or risk beyond identity and worldview, keeping overall pressure moderate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of anomaly, pen, and profession: interpretation versus authorship, drafts of reality, and the ethics/comfort of living between versions. Recurring images (the bent/straightened nib, the “margin between drafts,” confident uncertainty) are reweighted in the final paragraphs without slipping into overt moralizing. Occasionally the language edges toward explicit thesis (“Her station existed in the margin between drafts of reality”), but it still feels earned by prior imagery. The ending’s answer—that meaning-making is participatory and destabilizing yet consoling—resonates beyond the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, precise, and colored by Mara’s professional lens; metaphors about editing, drafts, and signals feel native to her mind. Syntax and rhythm vary well, with a good balance of concrete detail and conceptual phrasing. The repetition of “confidently uncertain” at the end reads as a deliberate echo rather than a cheap callback. There’s no POV leakage or register drift; the voice maintains a distinct, calmly lyric texture under conceptual pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prose is controlled and information-dense; most sentences are doing at least two jobs (worldbuilding, interiority, and theme) without noticeable scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is consistent and cohesive—editing, drafts, bookmarks, margins—rather than a mixed grab bag, and it doesn’t obscure basic sense. A few lines summarize big conceptual moves (“history flexed like a poem being edited”) but they function as efficient compression rather than exposition bloat. Rhythm and paragraphing support a smooth escalation from routine to uncanny.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The concept of a gravitational anomaly as a temporal “bookmark” where cosmic signals retroactively edit history is fresh, and the pairing with a literal fountain pen as a revision tool gives the story a memorable, integrated metaphor system. The shift from interpreter to co-writer of the universe’s corrections feels like a non-obvious but inevitable extension of the premise. While “signals changing reality” isn’t wholly unprecedented, the specific execution via contingent astronomical relationships and archival records gives it distinctiveness. The emotional inflection—strange comfort in accepting a fluid reality—adds further originality.</comment>
