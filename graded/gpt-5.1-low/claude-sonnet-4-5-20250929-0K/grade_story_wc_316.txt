<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Both Kiras are sharply drawn with clear, conflicting motives, and Kira’s numbness versus Clone-Kira’s intensity plays convincingly through their choices. The admission “I don’t love her” feels earned and costly. A slight weakness is the occasional diagnostic self-labeling (“I came back wrong”) that feels a touch on-the-nose rather than embodied. Overall, the relationship as crucible is strong and the final shared decision is well-motivated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece holds to a single continuous scene with clean orientation and a coherent, situational drive focused on the custody decision. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the binary choice (one mother) is rejected in favor of a complementary joint custody, with visible conceptual cost. Causal beats are clear—Kira’s admission, her argument about balance, Clone-Kira’s conditional acceptance—though the court’s pressure remains offstage and the negotiation resolves a bit smoothly. Structure is solid but could benefit from one more concrete test or pushback before agreement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo, quantum foam, and glass-jar brain are vivid and specific, and they consistently mirror and charge the philosophical stakes. The dojo’s rotation and the view of history rewriting itself function as more than décor, reinforcing the theme of shifting causality and fragmented wholeness. However, the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactics or options; it’s more atmospheric than operative. Still, the integration of setting and mood is high-level and memorable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—who will raise the child and how—is signaled early and tightly linked to Kira’s internal fight against numbness. Conflict escalates when Kira admits her lack of love and then reframes the problem as a need for complementary opposites, forcing a more complex ethical calculus. The cost is largely conceptual and relational rather than dramatized through concrete risk to the child, so tension stays intellectual more than visceral. The main reversal (from “we can’t both raise her” to shared custody) is effective but a little under-contested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—wholeness through fragmentation and balance of opposites—emerges organically from the clone premise, the brain in the jar, and the custody choice. The final image of “Two mothers, one child, a brain in a jar labeled with honest uncertainty” resonates and reweights the story’s questions about identity and parenthood. Some thematic lines edge close to essay (“Courts want simplicity. Judges want narratives that fit precedent.”), slightly flattening subtext into explicit statement. Nonetheless, the piece avoids simple moralizing and leaves productive ambiguity around what “whole” really means.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The close-third voice on Kira is consistent, with a controlled speculative register and a clear perceptual signature (seeing timelines as neural branches, for instance). Dialogue is clean, plausible for the characters’ intellect and context, and carries subtext about guilt, love, and self-doubt. Occasionally the narration slips toward a general-philosophical essay tone that feels less tightly bound to Kira’s immediate sensory or emotional experience. Even so, POV remains controlled and legible throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally precise, rhythmic, and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty for worldbuilding and psychology (“Timelines branched and merged like neural pathways”). There are no major loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddles; repetition of certain phrases (“complementary opposites,” “history rewrites itself”) reads as intentional motif rather than padding. A few abstract formulations could be grounded more concretely, but they don’t impede clarity or momentum. Line-level craft is strong enough for high-tier markets.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of ego death, quantum-rewriting timelines, clone motherhood, and a literal backup brain in a jar feels fresh and particular. The custody battle framed not as a legal drama but as a metaphysical negotiation about wholeness is an inventive angle. While the trope of “complementary opposites” is familiar, it’s applied here with unusual specificity to identity continuity and parental fitness. The story takes real conceptual risks and mostly follows through on them without retreat.</comment>
