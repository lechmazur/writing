<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The wreck-diver is vivid, particular, and clearly motivated by a non-generic ethic of “salvaging something pure,” and her methodical listening/mapping of dream fragments feels like real practice rather than label. However, she is almost wholly unconflicted—there’s little sense of competing impulses or risk in how she handles these ghosts. The final act with the snow globe feels aligned with her from the outset, so the emotional cost to her is muted. This keeps the piece from reaching the deepest bands of character complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The accumulative structure—present-tense ritual framed by explanatory middle and the dream-ripple coda—reads coherent and purposeful, with a clear before/after in the child’s release and the fading cameos. Causality is soft but consistent: globe → dream cameos → her mapping → installation in ice → dispersed ripples in strangers’ lives. Closure lands cleanly as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive plot turn, and the “sea remembers everything” return ties the loop. The limitation is that the central action is never seriously in doubt, so the climax feels more like confirmation than a pressured choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The glacier shrine is exceptionally vivid—“candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice,” “borrowed starlight,” blue-veined walls—and the snow globe as micro-setting is tightly fused to the story’s emotional and metaphysical logic. Environment isn’t just decorative: the ice window literally becomes the vessel that reframes and contains the ghost’s echo, charging the final image. Details are selective and purposeful, reinforcing the tone and theme without straying into worldbuilding dump. Setting directly shapes the closure, which is a major strength.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the child’s lingering echo will be understood and released—is legible, and the investigation-through-dreams provides a conceptual pressure. However, the piece largely skips dramatizing struggle: no serious false leads, doubts, or risks complicate her path once the snow globe is identified. The key turn (recognizing the child is trying to deliver the globe’s “You’ll be safe” promise) is presented as insight rather than a contested or costly choice. As a result, escalation feels more like deepening mood than tightening stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—the ethical handling of truth, the persistence of small acts of care, and “windows of connection” between living and dead—is woven through object, setting, and final ripples with admirable coherence. The snow globe’s reweighting from trinket to protected town to window in ice exemplifies earned thematic resonance. Lines like “truth, when woven carefully, need not wound—it can mend” edge toward overt statement but are supported by the scenes rather than replacing them. The ending’s quiet human-scale ripples (fisherman, librarian, widow) extend the theme beyond sentimentality into a believable emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The third-person lyric voice is confident, consistent, and textured, with a clear perceptual signature (“borrowed starlight,” “exorcisms, not of demons, but of silence”). The mild omniscient glide into strangers’ dreams and futures is handled smoothly and feels of a piece with the ghost-focused worldview. Rhythm and diction are controlled, varying sentence length to support atmosphere without losing clarity. The voice is distinctive enough to stand out in a crowded submissions pile.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The line-level work is strong: dense but mostly clean imagery, minimal redundancy, and sentences that usually carry multiple jobs (world, mood, theme) without sagging. Metaphoric language is frequent yet coherent, staying within the ice/sea/light/dream palette and avoiding mixed vehicles that would blur sense. There’s a slight flirtation with purple in a few stacked modifiers, but it doesn’t materially slow the piece or obscure cause/effect. Overall, the prose passes a high bar for rhythm, precision, and economy at this length.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of wreck-diving, dream analysis, glacier shrine, and a melted snow globe as a conduit for a child’s last protective impulse feels genuinely fresh. “Windows of connection” as a literal ice window and a metaphysical framework is an elegant, non-obvious angle on ghost stories. The ripple-closure—small, human decisions altered worldwide—extends the premise in a way that feels inevitable once seen. While not formally radical, the piece’s conceptual blend and object work show a high level of ingenuity.</comment>
