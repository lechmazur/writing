<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tracer’s motivation (answering emotional “echoes” so they don’t fester into hauntings) is clear and particular, and the girl’s frozen grief is vividly embodied. The protagonist’s professionalism and quiet empathy feel earned, especially in the choice to kneel, tune the device, and tell the hard truth. What’s thinner is internal contradiction: we’re told she’s seen souls “fracture from listening to silence,” but we don’t feel any live fear or doubt about whether she might fail this time. The emotional turn for the girl (from waiting to letting go) is credible, though somewhat swift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: envelope → photograph’s pulse → hearing aid tracking → discovery of the girl → emotional “broadcast” and release. It’s a single, continuous scene with no orientation debt and a clear before/after: a haunted space with a trapped child versus an emptied, calmed atrium. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a big decisive act, but the shift in the photograph’s “pulse” and the girl’s decision to leave her waiting post land on the page. The only structural limitation is that the stakes never seriously wobble—once she engages, success feels nearly assured.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atrium is sensuously rendered—mist, glass ceiling “weeping,” statues, cracked fountain—and these details are filtered through her work, not as a neutral tour. The environment subtly participates in the arc (mist thinning, atrium “sighing”) and the objects-as-setting (photograph, hearing aid, lilies) charge the final image. While the space doesn’t strongly constrain tactics—this could occur in many liminal places—the specificity and tone fit the premise exceptionally well. Description stays mostly purposeful rather than indulgent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freeing a child stranded in grief—is clear early via the vibrating photograph and the ominous envelope. Pressure escalates as the heartbeat grows panicked and then resolves through her active choice to “broadcast” reassurance and speak the painful truth about the parents. However, the outcome never feels in doubt; there’s little sense she might fail or that there’s a significant personal price for her beyond effort. The conflict is moving but relatively soft-edged, with more inevitability than true jeopardy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of love as an enduring “frequency,” the ethics of answering the dead, and quiet, non-fanfare heroism emerge organically from her job and choices. The final emphasis on love changing frequency and incidental heroism reweights earlier images (hearing aid, pulses, mist) effectively. That said, lines like “love doesn’t die—it just changes frequency” and the explanatory “not with fanfare, but with quiet, incidental heroism” edge toward thesis-stating rather than fully trusting subtext. Emotional aftereffect is gentle and sincere, if a bit neatly framed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a lyrical but not omniscient stance that matches the quasi-mystical job. Diction and imagery have a distinct texture (“pulse of hearts long silenced,” “lullaby hummed through cathedral walls”) that feels like this character’s world, not generic fantasy prose. Dialogue is sparse but functional and in-character, especially the soft, unhurried way she speaks to the girl. Occasional authorial-sounding phrases (“quiet, incidental heroism”) slightly flatten the otherwise strong focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and a high density of concrete and figurative language that usually pulls its weight. Images tend to cohere around sound, vibration, and moisture, giving the piece a unified sensory logic. There is mild risk of purple-ness—many lines reach for metaphor—but the figurative load rarely muddies clarity or stalls momentum. A touch more restraint in the closing paragraph could heighten impact by letting the strongest images stand uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise of a “contact tracer for hearts” using a defunct hearing aid to map emotional frequencies is genuinely fresh, as is treating hauntings as unresolved “echoes” rather than malevolent spirits. The blend of quasi-clinical language (tracing, frequencies) with numinous atmosphere yields a distinctive aesthetic. The emotional arc—a helper aiding a stuck child-ghost—is familiar, but the method and tonal handling elevate it above template. It stops short of a truly surprising moral or structural turn, yet still feels notably original and coherent.</comment>
