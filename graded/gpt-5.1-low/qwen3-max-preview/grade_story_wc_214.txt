<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The janitor’s motivation—seeking “strength in vulnerability” and reverence in decay—is specific, consistent, and cleanly rooted in his history with the Grand Celestial Archive. His interiority is concrete and embodied (the broom, the tears, the patched tunic) rather than abstract summary. He is not torn by a sharp on-page dilemma, but his chosen endurance on this forgotten station reads as a credible, costly renunciation. The backstory of the poet-astronomer and his transfer request deepens his character without feeling like info-dump.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The accumulative structure is clear: quiet routine → remembered past → anomalous comet → efflorescent dissolution → return to sweeping with a reweighted stillness. Causality holds under a textural lens, and the rogue comet is a focused escalation that crystallizes what he’s been practicing. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: he resumes the same action, but the universe’s “exhale” and his tears underscore an altered weight to his vocation. The cost—choosing obscurity and unrecorded reverence over recognition—is legible if quiet.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is richly specific and filtered through his attention: crystalline deck, analog dials, wind-chime sensors, the Andromeda Drift rim, the gravitational sigh between dying pulsars. The yellow lantern glass functions as a micro-setting object that shapes how he perceives and engages with events, especially in the final image. World rules (forgotten station, unlogged phenomena) are consistent and support the story’s premise of unrecorded sacredness. Environment doesn’t tightly constrain physical choices, but it decisively charges tone and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake is internal—whether he can sustain and deepen his chosen practice of honoring cosmic endings without institutional validation—and it’s clear early. Pressure escalates appropriately for a lyric piece when the rogue comet appears, offering a once-only, unlogged event that tests his method of presence rather than prediction. His “choices” are mostly attentional and interpretive (kneeling, tracing the path, choosing reverence over alarm), so the conflict remains understated but coherent. The cost and narrowing of options are emotional and philosophical rather than situational, which keeps this below the very top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—finding flourishing stillness and courage within collapse—is strongly woven through concrete events and images (meteors as psalms, the comet’s gentle efflorescence, dust sweeping as benediction). Recurring motifs (entropy as release, unrecorded phenomena, the lantern glass, the poet’s line) shift in meaning by the end. Some sentences tread close to aphorism (“Where others saw entropy, he saw release,” “To fall so fiercely…”) but they’re mostly earned by prior particulars. The final whisper to the emptiness and the station’s “agreement” deliver a resonant, non-moralizing answer to the story’s central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The third-person close voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature oriented around reverence and attention. Diction (“gravitational sigh,” “flourishing stillness,” “primal elegance of silence”) coheres with the janitor’s sensibility and the story’s spiritual-astronomical register. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; psychic distance stays stable even in reflective passages. Rhythmic modulation—longer, meditative sentences punctuated by shorter emphatic lines (“Flourishing stillness.”)—supports emotional beats effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is polished, with high information density and generally purposeful figurative language (“a silent bloom of light, spreading like ink in water”). Sentence rhythm varies well, and most lines carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, characterization). There is mild risk of purple prose and conceptual repetition around stillness, vulnerability, and reverence, but it doesn’t materially drag momentum or cloud meaning. No major loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle touch the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The “cosmic janitor” premise and the forgotten tracking station devoted to unrecorded reverence feel distinct and memorable within cosmic fiction. The synthesis of blue-collar maintenance work with spiritual witness to stellar death gives the piece a specific, non-generic emotional angle. The rogue comet’s choice to dissolve in the “gravitational sigh” rather than strike a body, and the universe’s “exhale,” are fresh inflections. The story commits to its quiet, accumulative design without retreating to plot gimmicks.</comment>
