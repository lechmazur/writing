<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The keeper’s motivation and contradictions are clear and specific: she pursues Helios-7 under the guise of “taxonomy,” lies to everyone including herself, and gradually accepts a role beyond corporate duty. Her “brightly attentive” stance and attraction to silence feel character-particular, not generic. The main limitation is that most of her struggle is narrated in summary rather than dramatized in present-tense choices under pressure, which blunts the emotional cost. Still, her final acceptance as “anchor” reads as an earned stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The structure is accumulative rather than scene-driven, moving cleanly from discovery of the patch and Helios erasure to the escalating 0707 pattern, the decision to trigger a mass restore, and a reconfigured status quo. Causality holds under the textural lens: noticing patterns → investigation/lies → ritualized restore at 07:07 → new understanding and role. Closure is a solid conceptual repricing: deleted files/people don’t “go” anywhere but linger in the substrate, and she shifts from seeker to anchor at real conceptual cost. The main weakness is that key turns (e.g., hacking in the deepest vault, consequences from corporate forces) are compressed into exposition rather than given on-page friction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The archive setting is vivid, specific, and thematically loaded: server racks as mausoleums, frosted glass, decommissioned AI cores, ghost pixels and latency as physical hints of the dead. The Helios-7 patch functions as a charged object that anchors place, history, and the final image on her sleeve. Environmental details feed the logic of the haunting—deleted content “unraveling into the substrate” and existing in hums, pulses, and silences—so the world’s rules feel coherent. The only reason this doesn’t reach the very top band is that the environment rarely constrains her tactics explicitly; it mostly provides atmosphere and conceptual logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering what happened to Helios-7 and what deletion really means—intensifies from curiosity to a quasi-ritual rescue-attempt, culminating in the mass restore and her acceptance of being their anchor. There is a clear tightening when she chooses to risk a mass resonance restore at 07:07 in the deepest vault, defying corporate expectations. However, external consequences and concrete costs (risk of job loss, surveillance pressure, danger to the janitor) are only sketched, so the escalation feels more intellectual than truly perilous. As a result, tension remains strong conceptually but never quite sharpens into a felt, high-stakes test on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of memory, erasure, corporate euphemism, and what it means to be “deleted” are tightly woven into every level of the story—from scrubbed logs and “personnel reassignments” to the idea of the archive as a resonance chamber. The recurring motifs (0707, the patch, negative space between posts, songs as cadence) all reweight at the end when she realizes deletion is dereferencing, not annihilation, and chooses to serve as an anchor. The final paragraphs avoid moralizing while delivering a strong conceptual repricing of digital death and remembrance. A touch more dramatized interpersonal friction (e.g., with the corporation) could deepen the thematic cost even further.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is confidently controlled, blending corporate/technical diction with a haunted, lyrical register in a way that feels unified and character-bound. Patterns like “She lied to…” and “She stopped searching…” are used as rhythmic devices rather than crutches, teaching the reader the cadence early. The focalization remains stable and trustworthy; elisions about the exact tech and corporate response read as intentional, not evasive. Under stress (the restore scene), the voice tightens without losing its distinctive texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prose is generally sharp, economical, and evocative, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept (“The archive wasn’t just a record—it was a resonance chamber.”). Repetition is mostly purposeful for rhythm and emphasis rather than scaffolding, and there are few, if any, genuine loops or slack lines. Some stretches lean toward purple or over-dense metaphor, but clarity and momentum are preserved; we always understand what’s happening and why it matters. Slight syntactic variety around repeated “She [verb]” openings would push this even higher.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a corporate social-network archive, a scrubbed space mission, and the idea of deleted data as de-referenced ghosts feels fresh and conceptually rich. Using latency, negative space between posts, and auto-generated grief bots as the medium for haunting is an inventive extension of the premise rather than a stock “AI ghost in the machine” trope. The final insight—that deletion is dereferencing and that she becomes an “anchor” in a resonance field—is both non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight given the seeded motifs. It stops just short of the rarest band because the external plot frame (corporate stakes, janitor thread) could push further into unexpected consequence.</comment>
