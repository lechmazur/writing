<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The fisher’s motivation (to find/catch the goddess’s echo) is clear and consistently embodied through her specialized tools and methods. Her cool-headedness under extreme sensory and metaphysical pressure is well dramatized rather than told. However, interior contradiction is only lightly implied (no strong push–pull between keeping/letting go), so her final choice reads more as ritual function than a hard-won personal evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The accumulative ritual structure is coherent: her calibrated movement, voicing of silence, spike conduction, and the echo’s release all build in a clear because/therefore chain. Closure is solidly on the page as a resonant reconfiguration—she fails/succeeds in a complex way by releasing the echo to the constellations instead of “catching” it. Stakes remain somewhat abstract and cosmic rather than sharply personal, which slightly mutes the felt cost despite the conceptual clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The “sound wave garden,” choral ferns, and sleepwalking constellations form a richly specific, coherent environment whose rules (sound as matter, silence as tool) are learned through action. The rail spike and sonic soil constrain tactics and charge the final image, meeting the high-band gate for setting-as-constraint. A touch more tactile or bodily grounding would make the space even more lived-in, but atmosphere and rule-consistency are already exceptional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering the goddess’s echo—intensifies via environmental dissonance and the garden’s shuddering response to her actions, with a clear tightening when the spike conducts the bass note and the echo erupts. The main reversal is her translation of wrath into a vowel and the subsequent choice to let the echo be carried rather than contained. Conflict is largely situational and ritual rather than oppositional or morally fraught, so tension is strong but not razor-edged.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of grief, non-possessive reverence, and transformation-from-captured-to-carried emerge organically from the particulars: sleepwalking constellations as mourners, the echo as maternal fury, the rail spike as conduit rather than trophy. The final image—constellations orbiting spike-remains while the fisher walks away with shards—quietly reprices the premise from hunting to custodianship. The piece avoids explicit moralizing, though a slightly sharper sense of what this costs her personally would deepen the aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The third-person lyric voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct sonic lexicon (vibration, echo, silence, pitch) that matches the world’s metaphysics. Rhythm and diction modulate well with rising pressure—the prose tightens around the summoning and rupture without losing clarity. At times the narrative stance feels more omnisciently descriptive than tightly character-filtered, but it still reads as a coherent, intentional style rather than drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The line-level writing is lush, image-dense, and mostly precise, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and mood (“silence hummed louder than any storm,” “the sky became floor. The silence became teeth.”). The repetition of metaphoric texture around sound and inversion feels pattern-taught rather than accidental purple prose. There is some risk of over-saturation—nearly every line is figurative—which slightly blurs propulsion, but causality and closure remain clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story’s conceptual blend—sonic gardening, transliteration of emotion into sound, sleepwalking constellations as grieving memory-clusters, and “voicing silence” as a hunting method—feels strikingly original and internally committed. The turn from catching to conducting/carrying the echo is a non-obvious but earned reframing. Emotional specificity doesn’t quite reach the heights of the conceptual ingenuity, which keeps this just below the very top band.</comment>
