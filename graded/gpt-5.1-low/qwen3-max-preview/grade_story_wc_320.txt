<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The interpreter’s obsession and quiet, competent focus are convincingly rendered, and her profession-specific interiority (“not to pray, but to tune — not by adjusting dials…but by discarding assumptions”) feels particular. However, she encounters little true resistance; seven cycles of failure are summarized rather than dramatized, so struggle is mostly conceptual. The archivist relationship is only sketched, limiting relational pressure. Her final stance shift (seeing the fragment as mirror, not key) is clear and earned but carries minimal visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The one-scene structure is clean: arrival → setup of coil/fragment → lunar perigee → tuning → activation → departure, with no orientation issues. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: perigee + fragment + cognitive “tuning” enable the city’s reawakening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she redefines ruins as instruments and endings as beginnings, then leaves with the city altered. Cost is mostly conceptual (abandoning prior assumptions and solitary myth), not deeply dramatized, which keeps this below the very top tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The abandoned radio tower city over a gorge is vividly specific and persistently functional—rusted gantries, leaning antennae, buried capacitors all directly participate in the climax when the city “breathes” and sings. Setting is always filtered through her professional gaze, avoiding tourist catalogues. Crucially, the environment constrains and enables the outcome: without this particular lattice of decayed infrastructure, there is nothing for her to “conduct.” A slight excess of stacked atmospheric descriptors in early lines keeps it just shy of flawless.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can she access the rumored shard of hush and thereby reframe endings/beginnings—is clear, and tension does build as the moon reaches perigee and the fragment activates. The meaningful tightening is her choice to “tune” by discarding assumptions, which unlocks the true function of the fragment and city. However, external opposition is minimal and the risk of failure feels abstract; nothing material is jeopardized on the page if she fails this cycle. The resulting escalation is elegant but relatively gentle, more contemplative than pressurized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The thematic arc—every ending contains its own genesis, failure as crystallized truth, Hollywood’s attempt at immortality versus genuine cosmic cycles—is rich and tightly woven with objects and setting. The Hollywood fragment and “shard of hush” recur with reweighted meaning at the close, supporting a strong conceptual echo. Some thematic material is stated a bit directly (“This was fantasy practicality,” “It wasn’t a key…It was a mirror”), which slightly undercuts the power of the images themselves. Overall, the piece invites reflection without collapsing into pure thesis, achieving high but not transcendent subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The third-person close voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct texture (“fantasy practicality,” “tides in the sky as well as the sea”) that feels anchored in this character’s profession and world. Rhythm and syntax modulate well between expansive lyricism and shorter, charged lines (“Not sound. / Not light.”). The motif-heavy diction is purposeful rather than random, and there’s no POV leakage or explanatory “helper” narrator. A slight tendency toward repeated constructions and favorite adjectives in the opening keeps this short of the absolute top band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences often carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without obvious scaffolding, and the read-aloud rhythm largely holds. Figurative language is generally apt and controlled, and loops/near-duplicates are rare. There is a mild drift into density and repetition of certain coinages (“serenely electric,” multiple “shard”/“fragment” framings) that edges toward purple in places but doesn’t obscure clarity or closure. Overall propulsion is good for a lyric piece, though a touch of pruning could sharpen impact further.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements—abandoned radio towers, a “Hollywood star fragment,” Broadcast Wars tech repurposed for cosmic silence, and “fantasy practicality”—feels genuinely fresh rather than collage-for-its-own-sake. The central conceit of listening for a physically manifest “shard of hush” during lunar perigee is inventive and followed through to a resonant, non-obvious ending. The emotional arc (finding beginnings in endings through failed human attempts at eternity) gives the conceptual play real weight. It stops just short of truly radical risk, but it is easily at the high end of originality for this length and form.</comment>
