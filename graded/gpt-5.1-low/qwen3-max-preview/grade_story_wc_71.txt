<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist is sharply defined by vocation and sensibility; her noticing and ritual choices feel specific and consistent. Motivation—to tend the “alive” houses and resist creeping normality—is clear and drives her actions. However, there’s little visible internal contradiction or real dilemma; she meets no serious resistance, so we don’t see her values under strain. The closing stance feels like a reaffirmation more than a hard-won change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural structure is clean: walk → arrival at bay → ritual → sensed response of the houses → departure, with no causality breaks. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the vanished cottage “unclenches,” and her ongoing practice is conceptually reweighted as necessary care rather than eccentricity. The cost is subtle—emotional labor and solitary vigilance more than a concrete sacrifice—but it is legible. Stakes and options remain modest throughout, keeping this just short of top-tier structural urgency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is a major strength: the bay, reeds, moss-slick stone, and daydreaming streetlights are sensorially vivid and tightly filtered through her ritualistic attention. The environment meaningfully shapes the action and final image—the rock, tide, and salt air are integral to how the shard works and dissolves. Spatial and temporal anchors are clear and consistent, and the vanished cottage’s ghost-geography feels specific rather than generic. The setting also mirrors theme without feeling like blunt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether and how the unsanctified cottage’s spirit can be acknowledged and released—is clear but very low-pressure. There is a mild tightening around the ritual moment (the hush, the houses stirring, the specific cottage surfacing), yet she never faces a serious alternative or risk; success feels almost guaranteed. Internal and external conflict are aligned but not meaningfully at odds. As a result, tension remains gentle and atmospheric rather than truly escalating.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—about memory, objects as architecture, and honoring what the ordinary effaces—emerges organically from the ritual and images (the shard, the cottage, the tide). The final “hushed blaze” image nicely reweights the earlier accumulation of hush and creeping normality. However, the last paragraphs edge into explicit thesis (“Some houses feel alive because…,” “Not to preserve, but to honor”), which slightly undercuts the otherwise strong subtextual work. The emotional aftereffect is genuine but a bit over-articulated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The third-person close voice has a distinct, lyrical texture with consistent metaphoric logic (“silence pooled like spilled ink,” “streetlights daydreamed”). Diction and rhythm are controlled, and the perceptual signature—sensory, ritualistic, object-attentive—is coherent throughout. Psychic distance remains stable, with no head-hopping or unexplained knowledge jumps. At peak beats the voice intensifies without losing clarity, though it occasionally skirts the edge of over-lushness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, with most images doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and harmonious; there are few, if any, mixed metaphors. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and syntax supports a smooth read. The density of imagery flirts with purple prose in places, which slightly blunts impact but doesn’t seriously hinder clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The core conceit—a “creeping normality noticer” sanctifying forgotten architectures with scent-bearing shards—is strikingly original and feels internally coherent. The use of perfumery, memory, and domestic ghosts synthesizes familiar elements into something fresh rather than derivatively gothic. The story commits fully to its quiet, ritual-driven logic and follows through to an earned, conceptually rich ending. It stops short of the most daring structural or moral risks, but its vision is distinctive and memorable.</comment>
