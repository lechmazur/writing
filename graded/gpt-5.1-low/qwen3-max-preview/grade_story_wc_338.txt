<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motivation—interpreting erased places with empathy rooted in family history—is vivid and consistent, and her actions (the years-long research, the choice to witness rather than rebuild, the yarrow offering) align cleanly with it. Interiority feels particular (maps as wounds, silence as vessel), not generic. However, internal contradiction is muted: she rarely seems genuinely torn between impulses, so the final emotional shift registers more as confirmation than as a choice with sharp inner conflict. The cost of her stance (what she forgoes by not “proving” or rebuilding) is present but understated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural structure is clear: research → on-site alignment → shadow choreography → chapel’s negative-space revelation → reverent departure. Causality is coherent within the lyrical frame, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the chapel’s “absence” is decisively re-priced as a living presence, with her accepting an ethic of witnessing over excavation. The cost is conceptual rather than plot-driven, but legible in her choice to offer a looped film as invitation, not proof, and to leave the site intact. Orientation is strong throughout; no temporal or spatial confusion undermines the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is exceptionally vivid and purposeful: the rain-scoured fresco vault, weeping arches, moss, and henge all echo and deepen the story’s concern with erosion, memory, and silence. Environmental details are filtered through her professional/ethical attentiveness, making the world feel inhabited rather than touristic. The vault, stones, map tear, and altar-shadow directly charge the final image, with the yarrow sprig functioning as a precise, earned threshold token. Description is dense but mostly controlled, integrating atmosphere with thematic and emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Conflict and stakes are almost entirely internal and thematic: will she treat the chapel as an absence to be “solved,” or as a presence to be witnessed? Pressure accumulates through pattern recognition (the migrating shadow, the spiral, the altar point) rather than through escalating obstacles, and there’s one clear deepening when the shadow resolves into the chapel’s silhouette. Still, tension remains relatively soft; the story rarely forces her into a felt trade-off beyond method and framing, so the emotional price of her choice, while present, is gentle rather than bracing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—silence as vessel, erasure as a kind of continued presence, ethical witnessing versus extraction—is richly woven through concrete motifs (map tear, vanished villages, reservoirs, the henge, the shadow-spiral). The final sequence, where she opts to “offer” a loop instead of prove, and leaves yarrow as a threshold token, gives a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central question. However, some lines approach over-explicit thematic statement (“silence, she believed, was not void but vessel”; “not to prove, but to offer”), slightly diminishing the power that the images alone could carry. The piece still leaves the reader with a strong, contemplative aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrically precise, and clearly colored by a cartographer-archivist’s sensibility: metaphors of maps, wounds, stitches, and alignments feel like her thinking rather than authorial imposition. Rhythm and diction are controlled, with long, sinuous sentences suiting the contemplative mode and shorter beats punctuating key realizations. There’s no POV slippage or unearned omniscience. Occasionally, the register leans a shade toward essayistic abstraction, but not enough to blur the focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, emotion, theme) and generally maintain clarity despite high figurative density. The recurring motifs (tearing, spirals, breath, silence as vessel) create cohesion rather than redundancy, and there’s little true synonym-churn or scaffolding. A few moments verge on purple or overpacked metaphor (“each droplet a metronome marking the slow collapse of memory into moss”), nudging toward saturation, but they don’t obscure cause/effect or the closure image. Overall momentum holds well for a lyric piece.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of cartography, shadow-geometry, erased chapel, and ethics of silence feels genuinely distinctive, not a genre template with new names. The idea of reconstructing a “whispered chapel” through decades of silent footage and negative space, then choosing to witness rather than excavate, is a fresh inflection on ruins and haunting. The spiral-shadow altar and torn map as cartographic wound are especially memorable. Risks in structure (highly lyric, concept-driven) and concept pay off without sacrificing legibility.</comment>
