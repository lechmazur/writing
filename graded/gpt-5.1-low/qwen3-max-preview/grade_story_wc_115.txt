<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motivations are rich and specific—“calibration” rather than belief is a sharp, character-particular driver. Interiority is well-embodied (static after sleep, tunnel echoes, tactile contact with the valve). Her contradiction as a skeptic drawn to psychic radio and hauntings feels psychologically credible. The closing shift from trying to offload guilt to accepting it as hers is earned and carries visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: confession → hush/intolerable silence → investigation based on calls → discovery of the wheel and radio → recognition of her own voice → revaluation and choice. The global drive reads Hybrid with an accumulative textural build toward a clear conceptual repricing at the end. The transistor radio still working and the “unconsciously lugged here” line skate close to convenience, but they function as psychological rather than literal realism and don’t break closure. The ending offers a solid Earned Stasis/CR mix: she cannot undo the deaths but reconfigures her relation to the guilt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tunnel, mildew, damp gravel, rusted alcove, and tarnished brass wheel create a vivid, claustrophobic atmosphere filtered through her alert yet exhausted perception. The environment works as a liminal, underworld-like space that mirrors her descent into suppressed truth without feeling like blunt symbolism. The valve and radio operate as micro-setting tools that constrain tactile choices (kneeling, touching, twisting, pocketing). These objects and the tunnel frame charge the final walk back toward dawn with concrete resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The primary conflict is internal: can she externalize the mill deaths as haunting, or must she own the inherited guilt? Pressure escalates effectively when the ghostly expectation collapses into the shock of recognizing her own drunk, grieving voice on the radio. The twist of the wheel and decision to leave it—and to pocket the radio—are modest but decisive acts that crystallize her stance. Stakes stay intimate rather than perilous, but the emotional cost is legible and scaled appropriately to the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of guilt, memory, and how we mythologize trauma emerge organically from the mill deaths, falsified reports, and the “factory ghost shift” as mental machinery rather than literal spirits. Reframing the haunting as the mind’s attempt to rewind unsaid truths is conceptually strong. However, the final paragraphs verge on explicit exposition (“She didn’t believe in ghosts. But she believed in echoes…”) that slightly over-articulate what the story has already dramatized. The resonance still lands, but with a touch of essayistic stating-what’s-there.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent, with nice turns like “drowsy alertness that clung to her like static after sleep.” Diction and rhythm feel suited to a thoughtful, skeptical protagonist without sliding into academic abstraction. The narrative distance holds steady, letting reflection blur smoothly into immediate perception. Occasional thematic lines at the end edge into authorial gloss but don’t disrupt the POV or undermine the voice’s integrity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, dense but mostly efficient imagery, and minimal scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors (e.g., “looms clattering like chattering teeth,” “dust falling…like silent applause”) are vivid and coherent, enhancing mood rather than obscuring sense. Prose keeps good momentum despite reflective content, with nearly every line advancing character or atmosphere. The closing thematic statements are slightly more abstract than the rest, but they remain clear and don’t significantly drag the rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fusion of radio psychics, industrial haunting, and inherited guilt feels fresh, particularly the reveal that the haunting is structured around her own archived call. Recasting a ghost story as a calibration exercise for moral weight is an original emotional and conceptual angle. The transistor-radio-as-echo device and the “ghost shift” as psychic replay give the piece distinct identity. It takes real but controlled risks in concept and structure without losing clarity.</comment>
