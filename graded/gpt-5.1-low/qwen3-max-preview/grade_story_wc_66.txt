<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The copyist’s core drive—rebellious preservation, “to teach dust to tell stories again”—is vivid and consistent, and her eventual choice to broadcast feels like a natural extension of her practiced secrecy and devotion. Interiority is conveyed through tactile detail (ink-stained fingers, tears blurring staves), grounding emotion without label-speak. The discovery that her tears are the catalyst sharpens her vulnerability into a concrete, costly action. Internal contradiction is relatively muted (she adapts quickly to the new role of transmitter), but at this length it still reads earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural structure is clear: famine → secret listening practice → increasingly intense signals → personal invocation (“about her”) → transformation into broadcaster. Causality is coherent within the lyric premise: pirate songs unlock dust-memories; tears complete the circuit; she decides to answer back. Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—the network of “scattered, silent scribes” reframes prior broadcasts and her own labor, and her first transmission changes her options going forward. The cost is primarily emotional and existential (exposure, mourning, commitment) rather than dramatized danger, which keeps this just shy of the very top tier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ember alcove, mist, hearthstone, and radio warmth create a striking, coherent atmosphere that feels both cloistered and porous to the outside world. Environmental elements actively matter: the alcove’s embers respond to her tears, the mist marks the world’s famine, and the dial’s heat guides and finally burns her. The setting’s logic remains stable, and the final image—“Somewhere, another alcove would warm”—charges the environment with communal, ongoing consequence. Description is dense but purposeful, rarely lapsing into static postcarding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—resisting the story famine by reanimating memory—is signaled early and deepens as broadcasts prove to be “resurrection” rather than mere contraband entertainment. Pressure escalates via the intensifying heat of the dial and culminates when the song turns its gaze on her, forcing her to recognize her own role and pay with genuine grief. Her choice to broadcast in turn and to encode her song in birdcall frequencies is a clear exercise of agency that narrows her path: she commits to being visible (to others like her) and permanently bound to this network. Stakes remain mostly conceptual/emotional rather than materially perilous, but the internal/external tension is well integrated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme coheres powerfully around memory, resistance, and the idea that forgotten things “remembered best when cradled in melody.” The dust motif, the famine of stories, and the transformation of pirate broadcasts into a clandestine archive all reinforce a nuanced meditation on how art preserves and resurrects what’s lost. The revelation that mourning (her tears) is required for dust to speak adds moral and emotional complexity: revival demands that someone fully feel the loss. The ending line, extending warmth to “another alcove,” offers a resonant, non-didactic answer about collective, risky stewardship of stories.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The third-person close voice is lyrically rich yet controlled, with a consistent diction that blends musical and tactile imagery (“thistled calm,” “monastic precision,” “moth-wing thread”). The perceptual signature is distinct: she reads the world through sound, rhythm, and texture, which aligns with her role as copyist and composer. Lyric compression and patterned phrasing are taught early and maintained, supporting the accumulative design without causing confusion. There is no head-hopping or stance wobble; psychic distance is steady and appropriate to the meditative, enchanted tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The line-level craft is strong, with high information density and images that usually carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, character) at once. Figurative language is frequent but coherent; metaphors around dust, music, and heat form a stable cluster rather than a muddled mix. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and there’s little to no scaffold or paraphrase looping—nearly every sentence adds or sharpens something. The only restraint is that the density of imagery occasionally borders on saturation, which might slightly blunt impact for a few beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of an “orchestra copyist” in a post-story-famine world, dust resurrected by pirate lyrics, and a radio that glows by touch is strikingly original. The tears-as-activation-code for a clandestine broadcast network of mourners is a fresh, specific twist that follows naturally from established motifs. The piece commits fully to its conceit, following through to the logical endpoint of her becoming a transmitter and imagining parallel alcoves. It takes stylistic risks in its dense lyricism and conceptual magic system, mostly without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
