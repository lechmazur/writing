<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The linguist’s motivation (“to restore trust after silence”) is specific, consistent, and embedded in her methods and risks, not just stated. Her “carefully reckless” nature appears in concrete behaviors (fist-pumps followed by triple-checking). Internal conflict is more implied than dramatized, and we don’t see a sharp contradictory impulse under peak pressure, which keeps this just below top-tier. The curator relationship adds a light but effective status and ethical pressure without fully becoming a crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/lyric frame: discovery of musical law → reconstruction of vow → choral test → resonant outcome. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the Silence is reframed as betrayal, and the ending silence carries conceptual cost and hope. Stakes and world rules stay consistent, and there are no orientation or lens issues. The main limit is that we never see a genuine near-failure or misstep in the ritual, so cost remains largely conceptual rather than event-level.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The extinct language archive is textured and integral—dust, chandelier, rotunda acoustics, and the drowned monastery bells all matter to how the ritual works. The ink well and chandelier both respond physically to the song, and the final image of the empty ink well casting “scattered promises kept” charges the thematic closure. Environmental detail is always filtered through her professional perception, which keeps it purposeful. There’s little sense of external geography or broader world, but at this length the micro-setting focus feels exactly right.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—risking civilization-level frequencies to repair trust—is clear and thematically rich. Pressure escalates via deepening: from solitary reconstruction to group performance where a broken promise could “shatter” truth again, with the curator’s warning sharpening that risk. However, the ritual proceeds smoothly; there is no on-page snag, hesitation, or discord that forces a new tactical or moral choice at the peak. The result is strong conceptual tension but relatively low experiential jeopardy in the moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—language as binding promise and trust as a fragile, performative structure—is woven through every choice: interconnected promises, betrayal encoded in a single altered harmonic, and the final convergence of paths. The Silence as betrayal rather than ignorance is an excellent thematic pivot rooted in story logic. The closing image of prismatic light as “scattered promises kept” offers a non-literal but clear answer to the initial despair about divergence without lapsing into explicit moralizing. A touch more on-page ambivalence or lingering risk could have deepened the complexity further.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The close third-person voice has a strong, coherent texture, mixing technical linguistic detail with a quietly reverent lyricism that fits an “arcane linguist.” Brief dialogue is natural and reveals stakes and attitude efficiently (“You’re playing with frequencies that broke civilizations”). Diction stays stable and character-appropriate, and the narrative distance is well controlled, especially as it tightens into the choral scene. It stops short of feeling radically idiosyncratic, but it’s assured and publish-ready.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is consistently high: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuild, theme, emotion) with minimal redundancy, and rhythm modulates well between contemplative and ritual intensity. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and coherent (“dust motes into spirals,” “walls themselves seemed to exhale”), avoiding metaphor muddle. There are no real scaffold loops or clunky transitions; each paragraph adds new information or pressure. The slightly lush density skirts purple but remains under control, and does not blur clarity at the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The central conceit—truth as literal symphonies encoded in legal text and activated via communal performance—is striking and feels fully pursued. The idea of treaties as interconnected sonic promises that collapse into noise when betrayed is a fresh synthesis of linguistics, music, and political trust. The archival-reconstruction frame is familiar, but the specific mechanisms and final ritual give it distinctiveness. More risk in plotting (e.g., a partial failure or unexpected consequence) could have pushed the ingenuity even higher.</comment>
