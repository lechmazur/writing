<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The survivor’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent, with a clear through-line from wedding trauma to obsessive “cartography” of unused potential. Her motivation is particular and non-generic, and her micro-choices (staying alone, repurposing the observatory, initiating another dangerous cycle) align with that drive. Contradictory impulses (grief vs. scientific precision, despair vs. bleak pursuit of meaning) are present but could be even more dramatized in on-page dilemmas rather than mostly in narration. The ending stance—committing to the hunt as memorial—is earned, though it’s a crystallization more than a sharp new turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The structure is clean: backstory → current experiment → new coordinates → decision to go, all under a single causal arc. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: she commits the observatory to a new trajectory in explicit dedication to the dead, with cost in her isolation and self-endangerment. Causality is coherent and there are no orientation issues; the geode and simulations naturally motivate each step. The only limit is that external complications are minimal, so the central “because/therefore” chain feels somewhat friction-light.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The floating observatory, geosynchronous orbit over the irradiated wedding site, and zero-g corridors are vivid and integrated into action, not just backdrop. Environment and object-as-setting (the geode, the “Cradle of Cold Eyes,” the observation blister) meaningfully charge the final image as she fires thrusters and bends the stars. Details feel selective and filtered through her trauma and scientific focus, not like a generic SF postcard. The setting does constrain options (isolation, reliance on tech), though explicit physical constraints could tighten even further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can she locate and reach these pools of unused potential, making meaning out of catastrophe—is clear and signaled early. There is some escalation: unstable simulations, overloading breakers, then new coordinates that require a major move (repositioning the whole observatory). However, resistance is largely systemic rather than actively adversarial, and the pressure never quite squeezes her into a visible trade-off beyond “go alone or not at all.” The conflict remains compelling but relatively smooth, with limited sense of immediate risk or loss for each new perturbation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme coheres around whether potential and meaning can survive violent erasure, explored through the geode, the observatory’s cold surveillance, and her mapping of “lives unlived.” The recurring idea that potential doesn’t die but “pools elsewhere” feels fresh and is dramatized through specific acts (simulations, coordinate hunting), not just abstract musing. A few lines edge close to thesis statement (“Her motivation wasn’t redemption or revenge—it was cartography”), but they still arise organically from her worldview. The final dedication pulse (“For Marta. For Elias. For Mom. For me.”) recasts the cosmic hunt as an intimate, haunted act without slipping into sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, with a strong lyrical-scientific texture (“perturbation fields bloomed… warping probability densities like fabric under invisible hands”) that feels particular to this character. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with good modulation between denser conceptual sentences and cleaner action lines. Occasional high-register phrases (“calibrated desperation,” “probability manifold”) fit the character’s intellect and milieu rather than reading as authorial intrusion. With no dialogue, all pressure rests on narrative voice, which it carries well without drifting or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is generally tight, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme at once) and a clear rhythmic sense. Figurative language is frequent but usually precise and thematically relevant (e.g., “oil on water,” “wound turning in its sleep”), avoiding major mixed-metaphor muddle. There are a few near-repetitions (“intangibly tangible,” geode pulsing/throbbing) that brush purple but don’t obstruct clarity or momentum. The prose sustains density without obvious scaffolding or loops, and the final images land cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of drone-strike trauma, an orbital observatory, and probabilistic “unused potential” mapped via an alien geode feels genuinely distinctive. The idea of perturbing predictive algorithms with grief-tuned resonance to find where unrealized futures pool is a fresh and conceptually coherent twist. Emotional truth (grief rerouted into cartography rather than revenge) grounds the speculative apparatus, avoiding mere cleverness. While individual components echo genre traditions, their combination and the bleak-yet-driven stance at the end stand out as publishable and memorable.</comment>
