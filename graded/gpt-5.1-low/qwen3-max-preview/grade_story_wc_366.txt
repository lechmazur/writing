<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s grief, reticence, and protective instincts are clear, embodied in specific habits (not reading the letters, carrying the sea glass, stacking stones). His motivations feel consistent and his final stance—carrying warmth as a “quiet beacon”—is earned. Internal contradiction (withdrawn yet devoted to anonymous connection) is present but could be sharpened in live, on-page friction rather than mainly in exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The structure is clean: one present-tense arc in the lighthouse framed by concise, functional backstory. The key turn is the lamp going out, then returning after his ritual, creating a quiet but definite before/after reconfiguration. Causality leans accumulative and symbolic rather than literal, yet the closure’s emotional cost is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The coastal town, haunted lighthouse, rusted stairs, and cairn window are vivid and integrated with Elias’s perceptions and actions. The lantern room’s darkness and later glow, plus the cairns and sea glass, all charge the emotional stakes rather than sitting as décor. The environment nudges rather than strongly constrains choices, which keeps this just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant conflict—Elias’s need to protect fragile rituals of connection versus his hollowed grief—is clear and coheres around the lamp’s extinction and rekindling. Escalation is modest: the lamp going out raises internal pressure, and his response (sea glass, cairn) deepens his stance rather than confronting a sharp dilemma. The price he pays (accepting an ongoing ache as his own beacon) is real but understated, so tension never quite peaks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of connection-in-anonymity, tending small lights against loneliness, and transforming grief into protective care arise naturally from letters, cairns, sea glass, and the lighthouse. The final image—ache turned “luminescent,” him humming louder into the dark—reweights prior motifs without spelling out a moral. A slight brush with sentimentality is kept in check by grounded particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The third-person-close voice is confident, textured, and distinct, with striking phrasings (“gulls…like feathered tax collectors,” “bruised twilight sky”). Psychic distance is stable and there’s no head-hopping or gratuitous explanation. The lyricism sometimes feels a touch more ornate than a taciturn skipper’s likely inner lexicon, but the chosen distance makes it plausible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and dense with images that usually pull double duty for mood and character. Metaphors are frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, with minimal redundancy or scaffolding. At times the figurative load (“velvet dark,” “luminescent,” “ghost-light”) edges toward purple, which slightly softens the impact at an elite-publication standard.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The core premise (a grieving lighthouse skipper as anonymous courier of comfort) gains freshness from specific inventions: the letter chain, stone codes, and sea glass as a returned “apology” from the sea. The haunting is tonal rather than literal, and the resolution avoids twistiness in favor of quiet reconfiguration. It’s not radically unconventional, but the synthesis feels particular and emotionally true.</comment>
