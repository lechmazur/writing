<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s profession, temperament, and ethics are clearly sketched and consistently motivate her choices—from investigating the study to returning the evidence. Her interiority is particular (listening to “what walls dream about”) rather than generic. The main limitation is that her internal conflict is muted; she never seems truly torn between exposing and preserving the secret, so the final renunciation feels contemplative rather than hard-won.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The structure is clean: a single, continuous exploration that escalates from atmosphere → journals → film strip → conceptual realization. Causality holds, and the closure—her mapping “A burden of knowing” and leaving the ghosts undisturbed—registers as an earned stance. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural and is maintained throughout. If anything, the story could sharpen the present-tense stakes of her decision to enhance the sense of consequential choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The estate, ivy-veiled passage, damp flagstones, and humming walls create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that is tightly bound to Elara’s perceptions. The environment is not mere backdrop: the fireplace, the ruined study, and the acoustics actively charge the discovery and the final mapping image. The physical setting and the “walls’ dream” concept are strongly fused, especially in the closing return to the ivy-veiled passage. A slight reason for not going higher is that the setting rarely constrains her options; it primarily charges meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The central pressure—whether and how Elara will carry or alter the legacy she uncovers—is clear and does deepen as she moves from vague anxiety in the walls to the specific horror of Prometheus. Escalation is primarily conceptual, culminating in her choice to record without “owning” the guilt, an Earned Stasis that forecloses the path of exposing or removing the evidence. The stakes remain largely internal and intellectual, so the tension is quiet rather than gripping. The cost of her decision (and what she risks by leaving things hidden) could be made more legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of legacy, guilt, and the ethics of witnessing versus erasure emerge organically from the particulars: the burned diaries, the Prometheus formula, and Elara’s understated choice to map “a burden of knowing” rather than moralize. The walls’ “dream” becomes a powerful metaphor for how places hold history without absolution. A few lines verge on explicit statement (“a final, arrogant prayer”), but they still arise from the scientist’s voice rather than authorial sermonizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—her refusal to carry the guilt—that reweights the entire piece.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Elara’s sensory-focused profession and temperament. Diction and rhythm feel deliberate (“the scent of moss and the memory of rain”) and avoid register clashes. The narration stays firmly within her perceptual frame while allowing a lightly elevated, almost elegiac tone that suits the material. There is no POV slippage or unearned omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is polished, with varied syntax, strong verbs, and images that usually do double duty for atmosphere and meaning. Descriptive density is high but not so lush as to obscure sense or stall momentum. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding sentences, or figurative muddles in key beats, and the final line lands cleanly. A few metaphors echo familiar patterns (“a key… unlocked the wrong door”) but they are contextually apt.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The combination of a “corridor echo cartographer,” walls that “dream,” and a climate-collapse accelerant called Prometheus feels genuinely fresh. The story commits to its strange, textural premise and follows through conceptually, especially in how sound, guilt, and architecture intertwine. The twist that Prometheus accelerated rather than mitigated collapse is less novel than the cartography conceit, but the integration of that idea into a quiet, post-catastrophe ethical dilemma is distinctive. Overall, it reads as an original synthesis rather than a template with new names.</comment>
