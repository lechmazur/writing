<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Amal’s motivation is fierce, specific, and consistent—grief alchemized into a quasi-mystical research obsession—and her interiority is rich with character-particular detail (wedding geode, jasmine, missile crater). The interplay of scientific rigor and near-spiritual fixation feels credible and complex. There is some room for deeper contradiction or a sharper moment of moral doubt, but for this length her stance and final crystallization (“the grief…now had a trajectory”) are well earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The structure is clean: a single pressured window while the system cools, with backstory anchored to present stimuli and feeding directly into the current choice. Causality is strong—missile → obsession → overdriven array → coolant trip → brief window → discovery—and the ending lands as a resonant reconfiguration with clear conceptual cost. The only limitation is that the external plot remains mostly in the realm of data interpretation, but within that frame the escalation and closure are well controlled.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The observatory, capacitor bank, viewport, and coolant systems are vividly realized and consistently tied to Amal’s priorities, avoiding white-room syndrome entirely. The space setting and the geode work as environmental/micro-setting anchors that constrain her options (the cooling window, the isolation) and charge the final image. Detail is selective and purposeful rather than touristic, and the serene Earth-as-lie image deepens the atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—locating the reservoir of stolen potential before the system comes back online—is clear early and tightens as diagnostics signal time running out. The main escalation comes from the convergence of time pressure and the collapsing “noise” into a single spike, with the breaker’s reset giving a concrete cadence to the climax. Stakes skew conceptual rather than visceral, but the story does make the loss of “twenty-seven stolen futures” feel weighty enough to support that abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of grief, stolen futures, and potential as a divertible current are tightly woven through concrete images (geode, crater, “music that would never be played”) rather than through abstract sermonizing. The final realization reweights earlier material into a cosmological theft with genuine resonance. A few lines brush the edge of overt thesis (“It was theft on a cosmic scale”), but the ending mostly trusts image and implication to carry the thematic charge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is confident and coherent, blending technical vocabulary with lyric metaphor in a way that feels like Amal’s particular mind. Rhythm is varied and often striking (“not tracking the stone or the splash, but the precise volume of displaced water”), and psychic distance tightens appropriately at peak beats. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the voice maintains its texture under pressure without drifting into generic sci-fi exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong, with high information density and many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. The figurative language is rich but mostly controlled; occasional phrases flirt with purple or clutter (“monstrous, a web of tensors and integrals…”) and there is a small bracket artifact (“[ intricately tangible a force as gravity”) that should be cleaned. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum remain intact, and the final images land precisely.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of quantum-physics methodology, metaphysical grief, and the hunt for a reservoir of “unused potential” feels genuinely fresh and conceptually bold. The observatory frame and the idea of weaponized theft at the level of futures rather than lives distinguish this from more standard revenge or hard-SF grief stories. The risks taken—highly abstract stakes, dense metaphor, and conceptual closure—pay off without losing coherence, marking this as publishable-level ingenuity.</comment>
