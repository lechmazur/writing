<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrator’s motives (recklessness, swallowed guilt, skeptical mindset) are sharply etched and consistently drive his choices, especially the decision to confront the valve physically. Interiority is concrete and particular (“a three-word sickness I’d swallowed for a year,” “hunger to trade my own gnawing anxiety for a sharper, more immediate fear”). The internal conflict between disbelief and sensory evidence is credible and layered rather than toggled. The closing endurance—he still carries the weight but knows he can—is earned by prior beats and feels like a costly, believable shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Structure is cleanly causal: confession → sound → investigation → recognition of blame → re-framing as a solvable problem → turning the valve → altered atmosphere and internal repricing. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear within the first paragraph, and the psychic-radio frame is taught early and paid off thematically at the climax. Closure lands decisively: the ghost shift stops, the room empties, and his relationship to his own secret is reweighted on the page. The cost—physical struggle and unresolved but bearable guilt—is legible in the final image of bone-deep exhaustion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and specific, from the “damp, devouring dark” of the tunnel to “machinery loomed like sleeping iron beasts” over oily water. Environmental details do work: the submerged floor, darkness, and rising pipe constrain movement and focus attention on the valve as the only actionable locus. The industrial space plausibly houses a “factory ghost shift,” and that concept is embodied in sound, smell, and texture rather than mere label. The final quiet—a tunnel room emptied of spectral noise—feels like a reconfigured environment that mirrors his internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dominant stakes—being misidentified as the cause of a catastrophic failure and confronting his own failure to act—are clear and escalate as the factory’s attention narrows onto him. The turn from passive observer to someone who “had to appraise the scene not as a haunting, but as a problem to be solved” is a strong tightening that leads directly to the valve choice. Cost is more psychological than material but still felt in the effort and the lingering weight of his confession. The only slight limitation is that the underlying real-world catastrophe and his personal “doing nothing” stay abstract, keeping moral stakes just short of maximal vividness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres around complicity, inaction, and the possibility of partial atonement by bearing weight rather than escaping it. The talk-radio callers and the “factory ghost shift” concept are not decorative: they parallel his own guilt and shape his reframing of the haunting as a question of blame. The final realization (“I now knew I could carry it”) avoids moralizing while offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening problem of the swallowed truth. Ambiguity remains—his guilt is not erased—giving the piece lingering emotional and conceptual complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The first-person voice is confident, textural, and consistent, marrying elevated diction with lived-in immediacy (“drowsy alertness,” “the world feel porous and strange”). POV boundaries are tight; we never slip into knowledge he couldn’t plausibly have in the moment, and the psychic’s show is filtered through his particular skepticism. Rhythm and sentence length modulate well with pressure, especially around the approach to and struggle with the valve. The voice feels distinct enough that swapping in another narrator would materially alter the story.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences are purposeful, often doing double duty for atmosphere and psychology, and there’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent; images like “sleeping iron beasts” and “a thin thread in the oppressive quiet” sharpen rather than blur. Prose propels the scene—no dead paragraphs or confusing syntax—through to a clean, resonant ending image. The only restraint from an outright 9+ is that the density of imagery occasionally skirts on the lush side for a high-pressure beat, though it never truly muddies clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of an industrial haunting, late-night psychic radio, and a personal guilt-confession is an original synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The “factory ghost shift” as an imprint of repetitive labor is a fresh angle on ghost lore, and using call-in shows as an interpretive method is unusual and effective. The emotional arc—helping trapped workers resolve a disaster to calibrate his own burden—is thematically rich rather than twist-driven. Some elements (urban exploration, guilt-haunting) are familiar, but they’re sufficiently transformed by specificity and concept to clear high originality.</comment>
