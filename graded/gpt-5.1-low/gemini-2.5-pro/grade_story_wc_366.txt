<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Silas’s reticence, competence, and deep attachment to the routine and the unseen keeper are cleanly established and drive every choice once the light fails. His motivation to “protect” is rooted in a believable need for safety rather than heroism, and the moment with the logbook and the farewell stones gives him a quiet but tangible emotional cost. The internal conflict is understated but present—he can’t save the person, only the system—and his endurance at the end reads as earned stasis rather than epiphany. This could edge higher with one beat where his fear or reluctance visibly pulls against his competence under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The structure is cleanly causal: long-standing routine → light goes out → urgent trip through the storm → discovery of the keeper’s departure → repair and farewell. Orientation is excellent, with who/where/when established early, and the squall/lamp failure is a crisp inciting incident. Closure lands solidly with the repaired lamp and the farewell stone circle as a resonant reconfiguration of his bond with the keeper. The only limit is that the middle conflict (reaching and fixing the lamp) proceeds almost too smoothly, with little complication beyond weather.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sea, skiff, lighthouse, and cliff stairs are vividly drawn and consistently filtered through Silas’s practiced familiarity, and the storm meaningfully constrains his actions. The haunted lantern room functions as a charged micro-setting, its cold emptiness underscoring the emotional vacancy when the keeper is gone. The recurring sea glass and the mechanical details of the lamp give a tactile precision that supports both mood and plot. This is just shy of highest tier because the “haunted” angle remains mostly tonal rather than affecting tactics or choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The primary stake—protecting the light/implicit keeper—is introduced clearly when the beam vanishes, and the pressure of the storm and failing lamp coherently escalates toward the repair. His decision to go out into the squall is a meaningful tightening of risk, and the discovery of the logbook adds an emotional deepening. However, the repair itself feels relatively unopposed; there’s little on-page friction or cost in the mechanics beyond “he diagnoses and fixes it,” so escalation flattens slightly at the climax. The farewell stones and sea-glass-beam image reweight the emotional stakes more than the external danger.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of distance-intimacy, duty as a substitute for direct connection, and the attempt to preserve fragile safety are woven through the letters/stones motif and pay off with the logbook line “Thank you for the stones.” The final images—the protective circle of rocks, the resurrected beam, and the sea glass holding “all the light and all the ache”—offer a resonant, non-literal answer about what can and cannot be saved. There is no overt moralizing, and the keeper’s absence reframes the entire relationship without tidy consolation. A slightly sharper hint of Silas’s future stance (will he become keeper or retreat?) could deepen the thematic aftertaste further.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is steady, with a gentle, melancholic lyricism that matches Silas’s temperament and the maritime setting. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and the narrative remains plausibly within his perceptual and conceptual range without drifting into abstract or clinical language. The ghost story touch (“The ghost was just loneliness after all”) is folded into his worldview smoothly, avoiding jarring register shifts. It doesn’t quite reach the most singular, unmistakable voice tier, but it is distinct and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is generally tight and purposeful, with strong verbs (“churning,” “bucked,” “faltered”) and images that carry multiple jobs—advancing action while deepening mood. There are few, if any, redundant sentences or scaffolding phrases, and the rhythm modulates well between calm recollection and storm urgency. A couple of lines verge on the sentimental (“a luminescent ache filled Silas’s chest,” “all the light and all the ache in the world”) but they are anchored enough in concrete context to avoid purple excess. Minor trimming of such abstract formulations would sharpen an already strong line-level performance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The core premise—a silent relationship between supply skipper and keeper expressed via stones and anonymous notes—is a fresh, specific twist on lighthouse fiction. The stone-stacking language and the sea glass as a physical token of connection feel idiosyncratic, not templated, and the misdirected “haunted” reputation of the lantern room resolves into a poignant, non-gimmicky human truth. The plot itself (storm, failed lighthouse, repair) is familiar, but the emotional and symbolic execution makes it feel renewed. Bolder risk—perhaps one unexpected, character-driven complication under pressure—could push it into truly exceptional territory.</comment>
