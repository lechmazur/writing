<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s characterization is strong: her frugality, rationalism, and quasi-religious yearning through mathematics are specific and consistent, and details like buying the notebooks “for a fraction of their worth” reveal her. The inner contradiction—skeptic building an altar of equations—is clear and thematically alive. However, her emotional experience during the discovery mostly stays in a cool, essayistic register (“Mira's hands trembled” is the main embodied spike), so the cost and strain of her obsession feel relatively muted. The endurance choice at the end (quiet obscurity and a 17-year wait) is credible but not fully dramatized as a painful renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The structure is clean: a single continuous scene framed by brief, well-integrated backstory, with a clear progression from hypothesis to test to result to stance. Causality is coherent—her prior work and the polymath’s architecture lead directly to this night and its outcome—and the “invitation” reconfigures her future options. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she commits to a long, largely thankless vigil based on this contact. The only limitation is that the path from experiment to success is relatively smooth, with little on-page resistance or complication once the night begins.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and specific: Nebuchadnezzar’s palace with telescopes, lapis tiles, clerestory windows, and regime shifts creates a strong atmospheric frame filtered through Mira’s priorities. The “ancient Babylon…reimagined” idea feels coherent with the magic-square architecture and feeds the tone of palimpsest and forgotten projects. However, the environment rarely constrains her choices; it’s more an evocative stage than an active pressure or resource beyond providing solitude and the artifact. The final descent of the ziggurat nicely echoes the opening, giving the place a subtle structural role in the ending image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether she can establish communication with the unknown—is clear, and the tension is intellectual and spiritual rather than overtly dramatic. There is a meaningful deepening as the prime sequence emerges and resolves into the orbital “invitation,” which tightens what’s at stake in her work. Yet the night proceeds without real obstacles or reversals; nothing seriously threatens the experiment, her access, or her resolve. As a result, the escalation feels more like a steady unveiling than real pressure that forecloses options or exacts an immediate price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of mathematics as devotion, contact as covenant, and the tension between material frugality and metaphysical grandeur are well woven through specific images (magic squares, “love letters…in cipher,” the regimes forgetting her while “something” remembers). The ending reweights prior material effectively: her quiet decision to wait in obscurity crystallizes the idea of encrypted faith in the unknown. Some thematic statements verge on essayistic explicitness, slightly reducing the sense of discovery. Overall, the resonance is strong but rides on relatively modest on-page pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled, confident, and consistent: elevated but not overwrought, with a clear match to a rigorously intellectual protagonist. Phrasing like “encrypted devotion required no belief, only fidelity to the work” shows a distinct perceptual signature that blends scientific and spiritual lexicons. Psychic distance stays steady in a close-third mode, and reflection is anchored cleanly in present action. There is no head-hopping or register slippage, and rhythm modulates well between exposition and the more charged midnight discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is elegant and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and characterization without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language (“bridge built from numbers and devotion,” “dusky harmony of twilight”) is generally fresh and controlled, not stacked to the point of opacity. Syntax and paragraphing vary enough to maintain momentum, and crucial beats—like the primes emerging, or the 17-year orbital horizon—are rendered with clarity. Any mild tendency toward abstraction in reflective passages doesn’t significantly blunt the closure image or causal reading.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of sacred geometry, a reimagined Babylonian palace, and a rationalist treating mathematics as prayer feels fresh and fully committed. The notion of “encrypted devotion” and a magic-square architecture as an interstellar communication interface is conceptually striking without reading as a gimmick. The quiet, long-horizon “invitation” rather than immediate contact is a non-obvious but thematically apt resolution. While it nods to high-literary SF traditions, the specific combination of elements and tone reads as a distinctive vision rather than a template.</comment>
