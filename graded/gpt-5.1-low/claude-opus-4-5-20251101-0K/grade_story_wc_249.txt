<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation (honoring Elias and resolving the haunting) is clear, consistent, and her night-time rule-breaking and drumming are credible expressions of it. Interiority is specific—“quietly rebellious,” “she called it haunting,” the felt space as he leaves—though her conflict is more linear longing than truly contradictory impulses. The final shift to “Volunteer Seventeen again” with a different loneliness is earned and paid for emotionally. A slightly deeper dramatization of her ambivalence toward the lab and the haunting itself would push this higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Structure is clean: present-tense walk to the sculpture, backstory woven in, the drumming ritual, then release and aftermath, all under one scene-lens. Causality is coherent (she enters after hours → drums → garden responds → Elias separates), and the closure beat—being alone again but recontextualized—is legible with cost. The drive reads as primarily accumulative/textural, with the ritual performance escalating pressure toward the resonance event. Stakes are modestly scaled but consistent; a slightly sharper on-page sense of what she risks vis-à-vis the protocols would strengthen the structural spine.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sound wave garden and auric lagoon are vivid, specific, and tightly integrated with mood and action (the sculptures storing sounds, the lagoon’s glow syncing with rhythm). Environment actively participates—the staircase, platform, and resonant materials are what allow Mira to trigger the transformation, and the final image of the dimmed lagoon charged with Elias’ presence lands strongly. World rules (resonant sculptures, quantum fibers) feel internally consistent at this length. This is near top-tier setting work; a touch more tactile engagement beyond sight and sound in the peak might deepen the embodiment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Mira can externalize Elias and fulfill his dream versus remaining haunted—is clear and narrows into the choice to break rules and perform the drumming ritual. Escalation is primarily internal and textural (the garden’s response intensifying, her tears, the felt separation) rather than conflictual, but it does culminate in a non-reversible change: Elias leaving her mind to inhabit the garden. The cost of that success—her renewed solitude—is explicit and felt. Because opposition is largely implicit (protocols, loss) rather than actively resisting her, the sense of tightening pressure is strong but not maximal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of memory as haunting vs. legacy, art encoded into matter, and what it means to “breathe life into a shared dream” emerge organically from events and images, not thesis statements. The garden as vessel for dying languages and a dead man’s dream ties personal grief to cultural loss, and the final reweighting—loneliness that “felt like the space left after completing something that mattered”—offers a resonant, non-moralistic answer. Subtext about exploitation (the Resonance Project) is present but remains background texture rather than fully activated tension. A slightly more conflicted view of the project’s ethics on the page could deepen the thematic complexity further.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical without becoming opaque, and clearly filtered through Mira’s sensibility (e.g., “auroral sorrow,” “the hush of the universe inhaling”). Syntax and rhythm are varied and support the meditative but tense atmosphere; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Technical/scientific terms are sprinkled in but kept digestible and in keeping with the story’s speculative-literary register. At times the register leans slightly toward authorial-lyric rather than distinctly Mira’s, but it doesn’t break POV or clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, purposeful, and often do double duty (worldbuilding plus emotion), with relatively little redundancy. Figurative language is mostly apt and not overstacked, and paragraphing gives the piece a breathable, accumulative rhythm matching its contemplative drive. A few phrases (“auroral sorrow,” “grief made luminous”) sit close to the edge of purple but are thematically on point and don’t blur sense. Tightening a handful of abstract formulations or near-repetitions would sharpen momentum even more.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The fusion of a sound-archive garden, quantum-entangled memories, and the emotional arc of turning a haunting into a living composition feels fresh and particular. The garden’s function (extinct whales, last words, lullabies) and the idea of someone “becoming” that garden as a posthumous composition elevate this beyond a generic mind-link or grief story. The risk is more conceptual than structural, but the piece commits to its lyric-scientific imagery without hedging. Some Resonance-Project beats echo familiar SF motifs, yet they’re reframed through the art-and-memory lens enough to maintain originality.</comment>
