<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira is vivid, with embodied history (dead shore birds, the abandoned head keeper, the grandmother’s cork) and a consistent, particular sensibility about quiet attention. Her decision to stay, to answer the call, and to guide the boy is all clearly motivated. What’s missing at a top-tier level is sharper on-page contradiction—she rarely wavers or shows simultaneous opposing impulses under pressure. The boy’s characterization is poignant but a bit archetypal, serving more as emissary of grief than as a fully individuated presence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The structure is clean: an anchored opening, ascent, encounter, invitation, and descent toward a new stasis with the boy. Causality is coherent under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: the scent leads her to infer a call, the call leads to the boy, the cork-guided intention leads to his acceptance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external change, but the before/after—Mira alone with a neglected light vs. Mira with a student and a new kind of tending—is legible. The cost is primarily emotional and past-tense (dead birds, the boy’s loss), so the climax feels more inevitable than pressured, which keeps it just shy of exceptional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse, the heat-scorched coast, and the impossible night-garden scent are sharply evoked and always filtered through Mira’s tired, attentive gaze. The setting does more than decorate: the tower’s function as a listening post and “loud” beacon directly underwrites the thematic opposition of light vs. listening, shouts vs. whispers. Environmental detail evolves meaningfully—the shift from lethal heat to cool stone and ordinary sea air parallels emotional cooling and the boy’s stabilization. The final image of the tower’s long shadow and the objects in her hands is charged and specific, giving the setting true closure weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the boy’s quiet grief will be heard and guided toward release—is clear and emotionally present. Pressure accumulates via the eerie scent, the discovery that he has been pulled across the water, and the revelation of his funeral experience; Mira’s choice to actively beckon and guide him constitutes the main tightening. However, her internal or external options never feel genuinely constrained—it’s almost a foregone conclusion she’ll respond with care, and the world offers little resistance. The result is moving but low-friction, with minimal visible cost in the present tense.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The thematic weave—quiet vs. loud grief, listening as a form of lightkeeping, and the idea that some messages arrive as “broken children” rather than bottled notes—is strong and emerges from concrete particulars. The cork, the scent, the birds, and the boy’s backstory all echo the question of how intention travels and is tended. A few lines (“Some lights are kept not with fuel but with listening”) edge toward thesis statement, but they’re grounded enough in image to avoid feeling like pure moralizing. The ending’s notion of quiet goodbyes echoing across oceans reweights the whole piece with earned poignancy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The third-person limited voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct lyric texture (“the exact color of exhaustion after the heat wave finally broke”) that feels aligned with Mira’s sensibility. Psychic distance is well-controlled, moving smoothly from atmospheric description to close interiority. Dialogue is spare but natural and carries subtext—especially the boy’s account of the funeral and his mother’s dictum about quiet ones hearing better. The voice maintains clarity despite its lyricism, and the modulation at the end into more declarative, reflective lines mostly works with the established tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The line-level craft is polished: varied sentence rhythms, high information density, and metaphors that are generally coherent and purposeful. Images like “paint the exact color of exhaustion” and “fingers like dried flowers” do double duty for atmosphere and character. There is a slight tendency to stack figurative language in some paragraphs, which risks purple if pushed any further, but it doesn’t yet bog momentum or clarity. I see no meaningful scaffolding or synonym loops, and the final sentence lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The premise—an assistant lighthouse keeper attuned to nonverbal calls, answering a grieving boy’s “vibrations of intent”—refreshes common ghost/coastal tropes through specific, unexpected choices (the vial cork, the night-garden scent as signal). The emotional insight about quiet grief and listening has bite, even if the broad territory is familiar. The story commits to its quiet magic-system and thematic logic without flinching, and the closure image synthesizes these elements in a memorable way. It stops short of truly singular because the external situation could still be swapped into other reflective-ghost frameworks, but the execution is notably above-average.</comment>
