<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and specific—her practiced heart rhythms, her weeping over the locust shell before she understands why, and her calculated softness under surveillance all feel character-particular. Motivation (quiet defiance, then catalyzing open transformation) is clear and escalates credibly. The moment of “Mira understood now” is earned by prior set-up rather than a bolt-from-the-blue epiphany. The only limitation is that we don’t see much contradictory impulse or genuine doubt at the climax; once she chooses, the shift is fairly smooth and undebated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Structure is clean: one continuous scene with a clear turn when the statue starts climbing and another when she switches from hiding to signaling rebellion. Causality is strong under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: years of soft defiance → practiced heart-code → statue’s approach forces activation → resonance shatters the system. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual repricing—the sound-policing order fails on the page, and her new mission is legible. The main limit is that the personal cost of the risk is underplayed; the old enforcement threat dissolves quickly once she acts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The enchanted orchard and statues are sharply realized through tactile and sensory detail (silvered planks, rotting fruit, marble eyes, blossoms falling upward). World rules (sound-policing statues, Archives of Permitted Sound, Calcification) are embedded in action and perception, not dumped. Setting constrains choices—she plays softly to avoid detection, uses the sky-bridge’s vantage, and the orchard’s roots amplify the heart-rhythm rebellion—while the locust shell and upward-falling blossoms charge the final images. This is rich and economical, though a touch more embodied interaction with the fragile sky-bridge at the climax could further integrate environment and danger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Mira will submit to recalibration or risk a systemic uprising—is established and sharpened the moment the statue climbs to the bridge. Escalation is clear: from covert playing to heart-code activation to a sweeping, orchard-wide resonance that breaks the statues and silences the old system. Agency drives the turn; she consciously abandons safety-quiet as she realizes “The cicada had not fought its shell.” However, the conflict resolves somewhat easily—once she chooses, opposition crumples quickly, with little on-page struggle or visible price beyond implied prior fear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Themes of regulated beauty vs. wild expression and freedom as organic growth (rather than direct confrontation) are woven effectively through the locust shell, the Calcification, and the heart-as-instrument motif. The cicada metaphor reweights the whole piece when she realizes she must become “too vast to be contained,” and the ending’s image of statues awaiting dead instructions conceptually reprices the regime. Some thematic statements are overt (“Beauty was not mechanical, could not be regulated”; “The old laws had been built on silence, and silence had just ended”), tipping toward moralizing rather than pure image-driven resonance. The complexity is good, but the sermonistic lines slightly blunt its subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinctly colored by Mira’s sensibility, with images (dust stirred in their wake, Archives of Permitted Sound) feeling like her way of noticing. Psyche-distance is well controlled: we move from tactile present to reflection and back without disorientation, and there’s no head-hopping. Diction is elevated but coherent with the fable-like, slightly mythic mode. A few sentences lean into essayistic proclamation at the thematic peak, but overall the voice holds under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: varied syntax, mostly tight sentences doing double duty for mood and information, and vivid, coherent metaphors (the locust shell, Calcification, apple blossoms falling upward). There’s minimal redundancy; reflection is well-curated and doesn’t stall momentum. The main drag is occasional abstract or summarizing lines that sound like thesis statements more than lived perception, slightly dulling the immediacy in the final third. Still, there are no major artifacts, loops, or figurative muddles, and the closing image lands clearly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The combination of elements—a world that regulates beauty via sound, statues archiving permitted music, dissent via heart rhythms, and freedom modeled on a cicada outgrowing its shell—feels fresh and integrated. The rebellion-vs-regime skeleton is familiar, but the specific mechanics (volume-based policing, resonance cracking stone, orchards remembering pre-Calcification wildness) give it non-generic texture. The final conceptual flip—that the enforcement system collapses not under attack but under meaning it was never built to contain—is particularly strong. It stops just short of extraordinary because the resolution pattern of “emotion shatters the system” is not entirely new, even if well-executed here.</comment>
