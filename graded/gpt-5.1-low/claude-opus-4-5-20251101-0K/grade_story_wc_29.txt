<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation and competence are clear and specific—her history as an astrophysics grad and lone “interpreter” roots her choices well. We see her act under pressure (welding the door, building and then deploying the transmitter) with a consistent, pragmatic voice. What’s missing at this level is substantial internal contradiction or costed ambivalence; she never seriously wavers or missteps. The relationship pressures (Dean, Aldridge, the campus) stay mostly off-stage, so her emotional cost remains conceptual rather than felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: signal → divided campus → Mira’s plan → entities’ reaction → partial reprieve, with the countdown to demolition giving solid structural spine. Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (the signal corrupted, procession faltering) and a clear ongoing constraint (they’ll return). Some beats—especially the success of her improvised device and the tricksters’ recoil—resolve a bit quickly and smoothly, softening the sense of real risk. Still, for this length, the arc is coherent and satisfying without loose threads.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The basement studio, burnt coffee, and old electronics create a tactile, lived-in micro-setting that fits the story’s tone and premise. The university quad outside and the candlelit procession broaden the world just enough and visually embody the stakes. The station isn’t just backdrop: its equipment enables both the threat and Mira’s countermeasure. That said, the environment rarely constrains her tactics in a concrete way beyond housing the gear; one more moment where physical space or tools truly pinch a choice could elevate this further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The central stake—whether the campus (and by extension humanity) becomes psychic fodder—is legible early and stays in focus, with the board’s demolition deadline giving real temporal pressure. Conflict between cult, administration, and unseen entities forms a clear triangle of opposition, and the moment when the entities “know” and push back is a good tightening. However, Mira’s plan works essentially on first try, and she pays no immediate personal price beyond stress and isolation, so escalation feels more conceptual than visceral. The ethical or emotional trade-offs of defying both factions could be sharpened to deepen cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Themes of polarization as manufactured resource and the value of uncertainty/curiosity over righteous certainty come through organically from events rather than pure sermonizing. The “farmers of discord” metaphor and the ending image of spoiled harvest and human silence provide a resonant conceptual repricing of conflict. At times, the text edges toward explicit thesis (“They weren’t invaders. They were farmers…”) and the moral of manipulation vs. critical thought is fairly overt. Still, it leaves enough implication about media, belief, and agency to linger beyond the immediate plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and plausibly Mira’s—technical without becoming opaque, with a cool, observant tone that sharpens under pressure. Phrases like “patient as starlight” and “the most human sound Mira had ever heard” show controlled lyricism without breaking POV plausibility. There’s no head-hopping or stance drift, and interior access is calibrated well to the scene’s tempo. The voice is distinctive enough to be memorable even if it doesn’t push into truly idiosyncratic territory.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line by line, the prose is tight, vivid, and largely free of scaffolding or redundancy; sensory and conceptual work often share a sentence without clutter. Rhythm varies nicely between longer, atmospheric lines and shorter, punchier ones as the climax nears. Metaphors are mostly clean and apt (“tomb for WXHU’s broadcast equipment,” “farmers… cultivating human discord”), with no noticeable loops or purple excess. While a few formulations feel slightly familiar for SF (entities “vast and ancient”), they don’t materially dull momentum or clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of campus radio, astrophysics, cult dynamics, and cosmic “chaos farmers” is fresh and pleasingly specific, especially the idea of weaponized emotional subsonics countered with uncertainty and curiosity. The trickster-entities feeding on division is a recognizable genre motif, but the farming metaphor and technical implementation add originality. The arc itself (lone scientist vs. mind-altering signal) follows familiar SF lines and resolves somewhat neatly, which keeps it short of truly surprising inevitability. Still, the conceptual frame and details feel distinctive enough for a strong originality score.</comment>
