<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera’s motivation is clear, particular, and emotionally grounded in her grandmother’s history, and her psychometric process reads as a lived skill rather than a gimmick. Her internal state is embodied through tactile engagement with objects and spatial visions, though her conflict is more contemplative than sharply contradictory. The key choice—releasing rather than reclaiming the stored love—is credibly earned by what she learns in the reading. The main limitation is the relative softness of on-page ambivalence or visible cost at the peak moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The structure is clean: a present-time visit to the booth, a psychometric descent into memory/psychic space, and a return that yields a reconfigured stance toward the letters. Causality under an accumulative lens is solid—each step follows from the last, and the final act of loading the strip into the projector is a coherent response to what she’s discovered. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: the problem shifts from “retrieving unused love” to “planting it,” with a tangible ritual act. The arc is modest but fully legible with no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The projection booth and projector are vividly realized, with purposeful, POV-filtered detail (“smelled of nitrate dreams,” “seats folded shut like sleeping birds”). Setting is not postcard décor; it meaningfully frames the grandmother’s past, enables the psychometric reading, and becomes the locus for the final offering. The Simplex in particular functions as a charged tool-object that anchors both memory and closure. The only reason this doesn’t reach the highest band is that external constraints from the environment remain relatively gentle, more thematic than tactical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—what to do with the unused love embedded in the film strip—is clearly signaled and does tighten as Vera passes from observation to psychic immersion to decisive ritual. The internal conflict between retrieving versus releasing love is present but understated, with little resistance or real alternative path dramatized on the page. Escalation is primarily conceptual and emotional, hinging on the revelation of the golden room and the reframing of the letters’ purpose. The cost (letting go of a fantasy of reclamation and accepting a quiet, unseen destination) is felt but could be sharpened through more explicit friction or risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of unexpressed love, art as preservation, and “storage versus planting” develop organically from concrete particulars (celluloid, projection, handwritten frames) rather than abstract lecturing. The final realization—“It was not storage, she realized, but something closer to planting”—is explicit but earned, reweighting all prior imagery without tipping into sermonizing. The luminous jungle of film strips and the idea of a cistern of longing provide durable metaphors that linger. Complexity is maintained: the story honors the sadness of unused love without pretending it can be neatly resolved.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The close third-person voice stays tightly aligned with Vera’s sensibility, with a distinct, lyrical texture that feels consistent throughout. Diction (“nitrate dreams,” “architectures of memory,” “fertile shadow”) matches her profession and temperament, giving the piece a clear perceptual signature. Psychic distance is well controlled, shifting smoothly between sensory grounding and interior reflection. There is no head-hopping or register drift that breaks the spell.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is polished, with high information density—most sentences do multiple jobs (setting, character, theme) without fat. Metaphors are frequent but controlled and largely coherent, and there’s no obvious synonym-churn or structural scaffolding. Rhythm and sentence length vary in a way that supports the quiet, accumulative pressure. A few lines verge on lushness, but they do not obscure clarity or dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Combining psychometric crystal-gazing with a vintage projection booth and the metaphysics of “where unused love is stored” feels genuinely fresh rather than assembled from stock tropes. The idea of love preserved as goodbye-letter film frames and then “planted” in an old projector is an elegant, specific synthesis. The golden room of hanging film strips is a memorable, non-obvious image that nonetheless feels inevitable in hindsight. The piece takes stylistic and conceptual risks in a controlled way, staying coherent while pushing beyond familiar sentimental treatments of lost love.</comment>
