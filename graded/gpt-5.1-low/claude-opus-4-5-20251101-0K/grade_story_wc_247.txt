<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira is vivid and particular—her filmless camera, felt vibrations, and ghostlike observation give her texture—and Elena’s mix of power and exhaustion reads clearly. Motivations are well-rooted (Mira’s drive to translate silence; Elena’s to save the harbor) and their quick rapport feels emotionally plausible. What’s missing for a higher score is sharper contradiction or friction between them under pressure; they align almost immediately with little tested conflict. Mira’s “ghost” endurance at the end has cost implied, but her internal struggle between remaining invisible and stepping into influence could be more actively dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The structure is clean: one continuous nocturnal encounter, a clear setup (threat to harbor), and a closure beat where Elena departs armed with new understanding while Mira reframes herself from unseen witness to catalytic seer. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered images of silence rather than plot complications—and that through-line holds. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration rather than a decisive act; the before/after of Elena’s stance is legible and the cost (risk of loss, Mira’s continued marginality) is present if subtle. The vote itself is off-page, so the story leans heavily on conceptual rather than event-level payoff, keeping this just shy of top-tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The luminous harbor, weathered dock, and lighthouse cottage are sharply drawn, with water and wood doubling as emotional and sensory anchors, especially in the opening and closing images. Details are filtered through Mira’s visual and tactile bias, which feels apt for a deaf photographer; the harbor’s history is evoked economically. However, the environment mostly serves as atmosphere and symbol rather than an active constraint on choices—the same conversation could happen on another evocative waterfront with minimal alteration. The filmless camera and wooden planks do charge the final image nicely, but setting stops short of reshaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—the harbor’s demolition—is clearly declared, and Elena’s request for help provides a concrete goal: equip her to argue in a new “language” by morning. However, the conflict stays mostly abstract and cooperative: there is no on-page opposition, setback, or hard trade-off, just a nocturnal tutorial that goes smoothly. Escalation is more conceptual (deepening understanding of silence) than situational, so the cost and urgency of the vote remain somewhat distant. This keeps the tension gentle and lyrical rather than tightening around a tangible dilemma.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of silence, invisibility, and translation into other forms (music, political influence) are woven consistently through image and action—Mira’s mapping of pauses, Elena as a literal whisperer, and the harbor as an archive of unspoken histories. The final movement, where silence becomes a “torch” and the ghosts “become real,” reweights prior material in a resonant way without overt moralizing. A few phrasings (“joyful sorrow of possibility,” “music finally finding an audience”) flirt with abstraction but are grounded enough in the concrete situation. The piece invites reflection on what societies erase when they privilege audible power, while avoiding a tidy slogan.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a gentle lyricism that suits Mira’s visual, contemplative sensibility, and the integration of sign-language dialogue is clear and natural. Elena’s dialogue and signing carry a different cadence and status—more urgent, politically charged—which helps distinguish her. The narration generally stays within what Mira can perceive while still allowing for poetic metaphor, and there’s no head-hopping or register drift. While the voice is strong, it stops short of the kind of idiosyncratic rhythmic signature that would push it into the very highest band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, clean, and purposeful, with several striking images (“morning fog—present everywhere, touching everything, yet somehow intangible”) that do multiple jobs. Exposition is compact, and there’s little in the way of loops or scaffolding; nearly every sentence carries either emotional, thematic, or atmospheric weight. Some abstractions (“joyful sorrow of possibility bloomed,” “vocabulary of absence”) edge toward familiar lyrical shorthand but don’t derail clarity or momentum. Overall, the prose reads ready for publication with only light tightening possible around a few generalized emotional phrases.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The combination of a deaf protagonist who “reads” silence, a filmless camera, and a political whisperer seeking to learn a new language of absence feels fresh and thoughtfully synthesized. The notion of mapping silences like musical rhythms and using that as a political tool is an original inflection on both disability narrative and civic-drama tropes. The external frame—a threatened harbor and preservation vs. development conflict—is more familiar and handled in broad strokes, which slightly tempers the overall sense of novelty. Still, the story’s particular angle on perception and power marks it as distinctive rather than template-driven.</comment>
