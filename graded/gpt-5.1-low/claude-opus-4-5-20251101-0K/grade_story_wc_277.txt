<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Margaret’s motives (to understand her father, to decide what to tell the world) are clear and specific, and her investigative micro-choices track cleanly to those motives. The internal conflict between truth and protection is present but could sharpen into more simultaneous contradictory impulses under peak pressure. Her father is well-etched through artifacts and annotations, but Margaret’s embodied emotional life remains a bit cool and cerebral. The final choice—“something in between”—is earned yet could register with a slightly clearer felt cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight: the journalist’s call → observatory visit → examination of notes → discovery of the near-miss → decision about what to tell. The drive lens is clearly causal, and closure lands as an earned stasis/charged poise when she chooses a middle path and begins writing. The ticking date—tomorrow—concentrates structure into a single pressured window. The only limitation is that the asteroid’s safe passage is verified before the final beat, slightly softening late-scene tension even as it strengthens conceptual closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The observatory above the clouds, the tarnished dome, and the echoing dome interior are vivid and tightly filtered through Margaret’s gaze. The setting coherently mirrors isolation, distance from the world, and the burden of secret knowledge. The echo and the glimpse of the world through shifting clouds nicely charge the final third, though the physical environment doesn’t materially constrain her options beyond mood and vantage. Overall, description is economical and thematically aligned without becoming a static postcard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The core stake—whether to unleash panic by revealing the truth or perpetuate her father’s paternalistic secrecy—is legible and escalates as she uncovers the asteroid’s trajectory. The key tightening comes when she realizes the date is tomorrow and that her father has carried this alone for decades. Her final action (crafting a nuanced, partial revelation) is a credible crystallization of stance, but the cost of that choice remains mostly conceptual rather than sharply dramatized. A slightly more acute sense of what she risks—professionally, morally, relationally—would deepen the pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of truth vs paternalism, the ethics of information control, and inherited moral burdens are woven through concrete objects (newspaper empire, pen, star charts) rather than pure abstraction. The “orbits” motif (celestial bodies, regret, guilt) reweights earlier material once we understand the decades-long secrecy and near-miss. Lines like “He was honest with himself about humanity's inability to handle honest news” verge on overt thesis but remain anchored in her perspective. The ending’s decision to keep some orbits “invisible” offers a resonant, morally uneasy answer without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and suited to a thoughtful, educated protagonist. Phrasing such as “orbits of regret” and “correction fluid for the universe” gives the narration a distinct texture without drifting out of Margaret’s plausible lexicon. Psychic distance is mostly steady, with reflective passages emerging naturally from on-page stimuli and choices. There’s a mild essayistic sheen at times, but it doesn’t undercut focalization or clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences are clean, well-paced, and largely free of scaffolding or paraphrase loops; each line either advances action, character, or atmosphere. Metaphors are coherent and purposeful, with the orbit/guilt and ink/correction imagery carrying thematic weight without overgrowth. Rhythm varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony, and there are no clarity-harming artifacts or syntax errors. A few formulations push toward the ornate, but they stay controlled and don’t blur sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise—a hidden near-miss asteroid and a media figure deciding whether to reveal it—is familiar, but the specific combination of an inherited newspaper empire, a solitary observatory, and the rosewood editorial pen feels fresh. The idea that the paper is less a trophy than a suppression machine is a strong, character-rooted twist. Conceptually, “orbits of regret” and the notion of “correction fluid for the universe” add memorable inflections. It’s not radically innovative, but it’s an above-average, thoughtfully executed variation on a known pattern.</comment>
