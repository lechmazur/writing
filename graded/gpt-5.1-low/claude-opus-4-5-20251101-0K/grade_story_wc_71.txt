<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina’s sensibility as a “creeping normality noticer” is vivid and consistent, and her behavior—moving objects, walking abandoned houses, carrying the shard—flows cleanly from that trait. The realization about attention vs. objects is well-motivated by her experiment in the Whitmore house. However, her internal conflict is relatively mild; she doesn’t seem genuinely torn or tested so much as confirmed. The cost of her final stance (bearing the burden of endless witnessing) is present but underplayed on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The accumulative structure is clean: walk → experiment in the Whitmore house → reframed understanding → departure with a new mission, with a clear before/after conceptual turn. Causality is straightforward (her testing the displacement theory leads to the insight about attention and sanctification), and spatial/temporal orientation is excellent. Closure functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing of what “keeps a house alive,” with implied emotional cost. The simplicity of the external action and lack of concrete obstacles keep the structural stakes relatively low.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is richly and economically rendered—the bay, streetlights, swamp willows, and softened wood all feel tactile and specific. Details are clearly filtered through Marina’s sensibility, with smell (orris root), sound (water, heron), and light (amber, violet, honey) doing real atmospheric work. The Whitmore house and orris shard meaningfully charge the final image, tying place to memory and attention. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical choices, it deeply shapes tone and the story’s conceptual stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake is Marina’s need to understand why some houses “feel alive” and what that implies about presence and forgetting, which is clearly signaled early. There is a discernible deepening when she enters the Whitmore house and realizes the attention itself is the sanctifying act, which reweights her project. However, pressure remains gentle; there’s little sense of risk if she fails tonight, and no sharp reversal or dilemma that forces a difficult trade-off. The conflict stays mostly contemplative rather than truly testing her values or options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of attention, memory, abandonment, and sanctification emerge organically from Marina’s actions and the recurrence of displaced objects and scent, and the ending offers a resonant answer: patient noticing is a form of care that keeps places alive. Lines like “This was how you sanctify a space…” articulate the thesis somewhat directly, edging toward essayistic statement rather than leaving it wholly in image. Still, the orris shard as a “compass” and the idea of a “hushed blaze” in cold rooms give the theme textural embodiment. The piece invites reflection on what societies choose not to see, though it resolves a bit neatly for its subject.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by Marina’s way of noticing—phrases like “streetlights daydreamed their amber glow” feel character-specific rather than generic purple prose. Psychic distance is well-controlled, with smooth shifts between external description and interior reflection. Diction and syntax are sophisticated but not implausible for this focalizer, and there’s no head-hopping or stance wobble. The voice modulates gently rather than sharply under “pressure,” but that suits the contemplative mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm and structure, images are generally clean, and most lines do at least two jobs (advancing scene and theme together). Figurative language is frequent but mostly disciplined and pattern-coherent (breath, hush, scent, light), with few mixed metaphors. There is a slight tendency toward over-articulation of insight in a couple of sentences, but it doesn’t significantly bog momentum or blur clarity. No obvious scaffolding, loops, or technical errors interfere with the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The premise—a woman who “witnesses” abandoned houses back to a kind of life through attention and the displacement of objects—is a fresh, particular spin on hauntings and memory. The integration of a perfumer’s relic, economic erosion, and quasi-spiritual sanctification via noticing feels distinctive rather than templated. The emotional arc is quiet but specific to Marina’s worldview and occupation-like vocation. It doesn’t take large structural risks, but within a familiar lyric mode it demonstrates a notably coherent and individual vision.</comment>
