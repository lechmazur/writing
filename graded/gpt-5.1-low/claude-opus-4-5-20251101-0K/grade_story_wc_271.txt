<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mariam’s interiority is rich, embodied, and specific; her trauma history, present coping tactics, and vocation all cohere into a distinct psychology. The linkage between reading her own stress signals and reading plant stress is sharp and character-particular. There is credible contradiction (hope vs. realism; attraction to beauty vs. awareness of its precarity) without being over-explained. The only slight weakness is a mild sheen of therapy-language polish that makes her self-awareness feel a bit textbook at moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The structure is clean: one anchored present-day morning in the arboretum, with a single, legible backstory shard (the wedding strike) that directly charges the on-page panic episode and her coping choices. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds from ghostly remnants to hawk-triggered freeze to the final stance of contained stillness. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she recommits to inhabiting the present with cost fully acknowledged. It’s excellent but not quite transcendent in structural daring or complexity, keeping it just shy of the 9-band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The arboretum on the cliff, the fogged cypress grove, orchids, greenhouse, and dark lighthouse are vivid and tightly filtered through Mariam’s priorities. Setting is not postcard backdrop: the hawk, salt-blasted soil, and precarious cliff gardens mirror and pressure her inner state, and the final assertion that “the arboretum held her” explicitly charges the environment in the closure image. World rules and spatial logic are consistent and unobtrusively credible. The only thing missing for an even higher score would be one more explicit moment where physical constraints of the setting directly alter an on-page tactical choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Mariam can inhabit the present without being overrun by trauma—is clearly established and tightened via the hawk-triggered freeze and her deliberate use of somatic tools. Escalation is quiet but real: the panic spike is the central pressure point, and her choice to ride it out and return to work is an earned, costly endurance. Internal and external conflicts (PTSD vs. tending fragile life) interweave effectively. The stakes remain primarily internal and contemplative, so while they’re thematically weighty, the pressure doesn’t quite reach the sharpest edge possible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—how to live with irreparable loss while cultivating a fragile, non-naive hope—emerges organically from weddings and funerals, orchids and ocean, lighthouse and automation, without lapsing into sermonizing. The “pearl of stillness” and “the dead lived in the living” recur with shifting resonance, culminating in the closing image of being held by the arboretum. The explicit line about anchoring optimism in realism brushes the edge of direct thesis, but it’s grounded enough in concrete particulars to feel earned. Overall, the thematic weave is sophisticated, honest, and lingering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent and textured, with a clear perceptual signature: a mind trained on somatic signals, plants, and quiet calibrations. Diction and rhythm are controlled and varied, with lyric touches that feel motivated by character rather than generic prettiness. There is no POV leakage or head-hopping; the narrative distance tightens appropriately around stress. A slight gloss of essayistic polish around therapeutic concepts keeps it from feeling absolutely singular in voice, but it’s still very strong.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The line-level craft is excellent: sentences carry multiple jobs (character, mood, theme) with minimal redundancy, and the imagery (“categories of before and after,” “small vote for the future”) is fresh and coherent. Rhythm modulates well between long, reflective lines and tighter, bodily detail during the panic beat. There’s little to no scaffold or synonym churn, and figurative language is sparing enough not to cloy. A couple of abstractions (“what purpose meant when the world kept turning regardless of human presence”) lean slightly essayistic, which keeps this just under top-tier.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of an automated lighthouse, cliffside arboretum, PTSD survivor, and somatic-therapy-informed coping yields a distinctive frame on trauma and resilience. The “pearl of stillness” motif and the mapping between reading one’s nervous system and reading plant stress feel notably fresh. The emotional arc itself—survivor finding fragile peace in tending life—is familiar but executed with enough specificity to avoid template territory. It’s thoughtful and memorable without taking the most radical formal or conceptual risks.</comment>
