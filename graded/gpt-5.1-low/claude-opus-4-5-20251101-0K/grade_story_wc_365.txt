<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation—to understand her mother’s disappearance and the nature of her gift—is clear, consistent, and drives every beat. Her embodied relationship to surfaces and the shard gives her interiority some specificity. However, she faces little on-page ambivalence about risking herself; the decision to continue her mother’s dangerous work feels moving but not meaningfully contested. The mother is sketched effectively through a short confrontation, but we don’t see Mira’s flaws or contradictions complicate the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The causal spine is clean: shard → bay → mapping → rift vision → revelation → renewed commitment, with a legible temporal shard where she witnesses the past. The closure—a conceptual and emotional reconfiguration of her mother’s “abandonment” into sacrifice, followed by a decisive step into the rift—lands clearly with implied cost. Structure is straightforward and appropriate to length, with no orientation debt. The main limitation is that the toxicity risk never quite tightens into a concrete dilemma on the page, so the climactic choice feels safe despite the stated stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport repair bay is vivid and purposefully rendered: “cathedral to obsolescence,” frozen drones, lipstick-stained cups create atmosphere and history. The magnetic coupling unit and floor concretely matter, serving as the physical locus for her mother’s trail and the rift itself. Details are filtered through Mira’s professional sensibility as a sensory mapper, which helps ground the speculative elements. The setting does more textural and symbolic work than constraining tactical options, but it still charges the final image effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Mira will discover and accept the truth of her mother’s choice and what that means for her own—is clear from early on. Pressure nominally escalates through the building surge and the revelation of dimensional toxicity, and knowledge deepens with the overheard argument. However, conflict is almost entirely informational; no one opposes Mira in the present, and she never seriously wavers about stepping into the rift, so there’s little sense of foreclosed alternatives or trade-offs in the climactic action. The stakes read as important but not sharply felt in the moment of decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Themes of inherited responsibility, the costs of exploration, and the “weight” of withheld truth reconfiguring grief are coherent and well-rooted in particulars (the shard, the bay as a monument to failed ambition, the toxicity price). The revaluation of her mother’s disappearance and the line about truth as anchor rather than burden offer a clear thematic answer. That clarity tips into mild didacticism with explicit phrasing (“The weight of truth, she realized, wasn't a burden”), smoothing away potential ambiguity. The piece invites some reflection on sacrifice and agency but doesn’t fully embrace moral or emotional messiness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled, gently lyric SFF register that fits both the speculative premise and Mira’s sensory vocation. Phrasing like “reality felt thin as membrane” and “stacked like pages in a book” gives a distinct, if not wholly original, texture. POV remains stable and modest—no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience—and the brief dialogue feels natural to the world and situation. The main ceiling is that the narrative idiom feels genre-familiar rather than uniquely tied to this individual consciousness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and generally concise, with good sentence-level rhythm and a decent blend of image and information. Most lines do at least two jobs (world-building plus emotional or conceptual charge), and momentum is maintained without obvious scaffolding or synonym churn. A few phrases lean generic or explanatory (“the truth she sought had weight,” “finally understanding the price of the gift”), dulling the sharpness of otherwise strong images. No serious figurative muddle or structural artifacts impede clarity, but there’s room to trim minor abstraction and let concrete images carry more of the load.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The core ingredients—multiverse travel, a disappeared parent, dangerous crossings—are familiar, but the specific combination of a “sensory map maker,” dimensional toxicity, and a green shard as both filter and legacy has genuine freshness. The abandoned spaceport as a “cathedral of forgotten ambitions” adds a strong, thematically aligned backdrop. Nonetheless, the story largely follows expected emotional beats without a truly non-obvious turn or morally knotty complication at the end. It reads as high-quality genre work rather than something formally or thematically daring enough for the very top tier.</comment>
