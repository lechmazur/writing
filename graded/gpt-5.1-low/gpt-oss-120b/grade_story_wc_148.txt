<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The boy’s core motivation—seeking redemption and hush after a legacy of false alarms—is clear and consistent, and his choices (following the corridor, retrieving the chest, going to the reef) align with it. However, his emotional life remains somewhat abstract and symbolic; we get little concrete, embodied ambivalence or fear as he faces eerie bodies and impossible magic. Internal contradiction is hinted (guilt vs. purpose) but not dramatized in specific, pressured micro-choices. The final peace feels earned enough for the length, but with limited visible cost or moral friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The causal chain is coherent: lattice pulses → corridor → chest/map → reef → bodies → return, with a legible before/after shift from ignored warner to guiding light. The structure is linear and clear despite the lyricism, and closure lands via a reconfiguration of his role and the lighthouse’s meaning. However, the stakes around the bodies and any real danger to the boy are underdeveloped; nothing resists him, so many beats feel like preordained procession rather than pressured turns. The cost of success is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison, jagged reef, fog, and copper glow are vividly rendered and recur in ways that charge the atmosphere and final image. The environment isn’t just backdrop: the reef, fissures, and prison isolation underpin the logic of missing bodies and the need for a map. Sensory detail is rich and mostly purposeful, though sometimes leans toward decorative lyricism. The closing return to the balcony and beam solidly ties setting to thematic transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—redeeming his false-warning legacy by uncovering and guiding others to the bodies—is clear, and there is a basic escalation from cell to hidden corridor to reef and rising bodies. Yet external conflict is nearly absent: no guards, no environmental hazard that truly threatens him, no serious risk of failure once the lattice activates. Internal tension around fear, doubt, or moral conflict (“disturbing” the dead, exposing truths) is more implied than dramatized, so the resolution feels gentle rather than hard-won.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of truth, the burden of warning, and reconfiguring a cursed legacy into guidance are woven through recurrent images (lattice, reef, hush, lighthouse-as-prison/beacon). The line “every warning is a thread, not a wall” is strong but very explicit, edging toward thesis rather than letting the images do all the work. The hush transforming from escape fantasy into earned, quiet redemption at the end has real resonance. Overall, the piece invites reflection without collapsing into full sermonizing, but subtlety could be sharpened.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The third-person lyric voice is consistent, with distinctive phrases like “copperlight repose” and a controlled, incantatory rhythm that suits the fable-like premise. POV is stable and doesn’t head-hop; the narrative distance remains close enough to his perceptions while allowing some mythic framing. Occasionally, diction strains toward preciousness or abstraction (“knowing his motivation was to thread a labyrinth with your own story”), slightly breaking the spell. Still, the voice feels intentional and largely under control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose is lush and imagistic, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (e.g., the lattice bending light and shadow as a metaphor for his impossible role). There are some noticeable repetitions (“through the scuffs on a narrow door left ajar for decades” appears twice almost verbatim) and a few near-purple constructions that risk blur rather than clarity. Momentum holds, but density of metaphor verges on excess in places, and some abstractions could be pared for impact. Line-level craft is strong but not yet at a ruthlessly distilled, elite-publication level.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of “boy who cried wolf” lineage with a haunted lighthouse prison, a carved confessional lattice, and the idea of “chasing hush” is genuinely fresh. The map unfolding into a glowing 3D maze and the reframing of warnings as threads rather than walls offer distinctive conceptual turns. While the arc (burdened child redeems legacy through an act of truth) is familiar in broad strokes, the concrete machinery and tone feel idiosyncratic rather than templated. Some images and phrasings could be further individualized to avoid the feel of high-concept prompt-collage.</comment>
