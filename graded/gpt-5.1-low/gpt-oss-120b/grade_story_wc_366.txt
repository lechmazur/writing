<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Marek’s motivation—to recreate and protect a feeling of safety from childhood voyages—is clear and consistently expressed through his ritual and care for the sea glass. His interiority is particular (stones as “silent punctuation to an anonymous letter chain”), giving him a distinct sensibility. However, there is little genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulse; he rarely feels truly torn or under pressure. The final “surge of purpose” feels earned but low-cost, more affirmation than change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Structure is clean: one continuous scene from arrival to departure, with a clear accumulative drive as the ritual builds and the lighthouse’s mood shifts. Causality is soft but coherent: the extinguished lamp → Marek’s ritual → stone spiral pulse → reconfigured sense of sanctuary. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change: the haunted room becomes a sanctuary and Marek leaves with a talismanic sea glass and a vow. The main limitation is low felt cost; no option is meaningfully foreclosed, so the before/after remains more tonal than consequential.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse, lantern room, wind, and sea are rendered with vivid, selective detail that strongly supports the mood: “sigh of wind against the iron ribs,” “cold stone slab,” and “broken panes” all feel lived-in and textured. The micro-setting—the lantern room with its dead lamp and stone slab—directly enables Marek’s ritual and charges the final image of the glowing spiral. The haunted aspect is more atmospheric than actively threatening, but the environment’s transformation into “sanctuary” at the end reweights earlier details nicely. The setting is tightly integrated, though more direct constraint on his options could push it higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake is emotional/ritualistic: whether Marek can preserve or recreate a sense of safety and meaning in a failing lighthouse. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than through concrete obstacles, and external stakes (a dark beacon, a lone fishing boat) never truly bite—no ship is in visible danger, and no one opposes him. The main tightening is the lamp finally flickering out, triggering the stone spiral’s pulse and solidifying his decision to carry the sea glass as a talisman. Still, the conflict remains mostly abstract and inward, with little sense of risk if he failed or chose otherwise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Themes of safety, memory, anonymous care, and emotional infrastructure (a “lighthouse for hearts”) emerge organically from the ritual and the stone/letter metaphor. Recurring images—sea glass, stones, light/dark—are reweighted at the end when the haunted room becomes a sanctuary powered by collective memory. However, some lines tip into explicit statement (“a simple promise that safety could be bottled and shared,” “a lighthouse for hearts as much as for ships”), nudging toward mild moralizing rather than trusting subtext. The resonance is real but slightly over-articulated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is stable, with a gently lyrical cadence that suits Marek’s “warmly observant” nature. Diction is mostly consistent and character-appropriate, with good control of rhythm in sentences like “each stone a silent punctuation to an anonymous letter chain he imagined.” The narration doesn’t head-hop and maintains a coherent psychic distance throughout. At times the lyricism becomes uniform, with similar emotional notes repeating, which slightly flattens modulation across the piece.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose is generally polished, with strong imagery and relatively high information density—many sentences carry both atmosphere and character. Some phrases and concepts recur a bit too often (“safety bottled,” “anonymous letters,” glowing stones), edging into mild redundancy and a touch of purple prose. Syntax and grammar are clean, and action is easy to follow; nothing essential is obscured by language. Tighter cutting of near-duplicate sentiments would sharpen momentum and keep the lyricism from feeling over-insistent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The combination of a crumbling lighthouse, a supply skipper performing a stone-and-sea-glass ritual, and an “anonymous letter chain” encoded in rocks is a genuinely fresh angle on maritime and ghostly tropes. The idea of a lighthouse as an emotional network for unseen sailors, made literal through the spiral of stones, feels particular rather than generic. However, the story stays in a fairly safe emotional register and doesn’t push its strange premise toward a more surprising or risky turn. The ingenuity is notable but not yet at the level where every beat feels inevitable and singular.</comment>
