<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lia’s motivation—professional curiosity that becomes a moral commitment to the lost crew—is clear and consistent, and her actions follow logically from it. However, her interiority remains relatively thin and idealized; we rarely see contradictory impulses or real doubt under pressure. Her emotional responses are more implied by atmosphere than embodied in specific, character-particular reactions. The closing vow to guard the archive feels earned but not deeply conflicted, which keeps the arc solid but not piercing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: resurfaced patch → number pattern → deliberate test/lie → algorithmic scattering → hidden server farm → checksum key → vault → final conceptual shift about “deleted” presence. Structure is linear and coherent, with a clear closure unit centered on conceptual repricing of deletion as a form of stored presence. Cost is more conceptual than dramatic—no real sacrifice or double bind—but the before/after in Lia’s understanding and in the archive’s function is legible. The piece holds a mostly causal lens with light accumulative texture from the recurring motifs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The setting—the social network archive, vaulted servers, obsolete emojis, rusted racks—is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Lia’s archivist gaze. Environmental details (hidden sublayer, concealed server farm) directly shape her path and the story’s discoveries rather than acting as backdrop. Atmosphere (“hum of forgotten data,” “digital afterlife”) supports the core thematic concern with memory and absence. The final image of the archive “puls[ing] with the living echoes” neatly ties environment into closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering the lost crew’s final messages and reconfiguring what “deleted” means—is present but largely intellectual, and practical resistance is minimal. Lia’s main tightening is her decision to lie with the tribute post, which successfully escalates pressure by provoking the system, but everything after that unfolds with little friction or risk. There’s no serious threat of failure, institutional opposition, or moral dilemma to force a costly choice. As a result, tension remains gentle and the arc satisfying but not gripping.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of digital afterlife, the persistence of memory, and the transformation of absence into presence are well-integrated through motifs (deleted songs, hidden sublayer, recurring numbers). The final message, “We are still here, stored in the silence you felt as absence,” neatly crystallizes the thematic argument but does so in explicitly thesis-like language that borders on didactic. Lia’s shift from abstract curiosity to relational responsibility for the dead grounds the theme in character. The resonance is real but a little too tidy and articulated to feel fully layered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The third-person voice is stable, mildly lyrical, and well-matched to an archivist protagonist moving through haunted digital spaces. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with recurring phrases building a coherent tonal fabric without major register slips. There’s a clear perceptual signature in how the narrator notices songs, patches, and data as quasi-sacred artifacts. The voice could push further into idiosyncrasy or tension under peak beats, but it’s already polished and confident.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose is generally clean, concentrated, and rhythmically varied, with many sentences doing double duty for plot and atmosphere. Some metaphors and repeated phrases (“echo of forgotten songs,” “hum of forgotten data”) verge on the familiar or slightly purple but don’t cloud meaning. There’s little scaffolding or synonym-churn; information flows forward with decent momentum despite the reflective mode. Line-level craft is strong enough for competitive venues, though a pass to trim repetitions and sharpen a few images would elevate it further.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The fusion of a corporate memory keeper, a social network’s hidden sublayer, and a missing space expedition encoding itself into comment metadata feels fresh and conceptually coherent. Using algorithmic behavior and recurring numbers as a breadcrumb trail into a digital afterlife is an inventive twist on both cold-case and SF tropes. The final conceptual turn—that the absent are “stored in the silence”—reframes platform ephemera and deletion in an interesting way. It stops just short of startling originality because the emotional and institutional frictions around such a discovery remain relatively unexplored.</comment>
