<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Caleb’s reticence, sense of duty, and “warmly observant” nature are clearly dramatized through his routines, attention to detail, and quiet ritual with the cairn. His motivation to protect both the literal light and the emotional “feeling of safety” is coherent and drives his choices. Internal contradiction (comfort vs. unease with the ghost, isolation vs. connection through letters) is present but only lightly probed rather than fully dramatized in conflict. The final endurance—continuing the chain and guarding the light—is credible but could carry sharper, more specific cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The structure is clean: lamp failure → discovery of sea glass/ghostly presence → bottling ritual at the cairn → relighting → morning reply. Causality holds under a largely accumulative/textural lens, and the closure—a resonant reconfiguration where safety is “bottled” and the chain reaffirmed—lands clearly. The emotional cost is mostly implied rather than sharply turned, but the before/after (an unbroken but now more consciously sacred duty) is legible. No orientation or lens-clarity issues undermine the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse, lantern room, cairn of stones, and sea are vividly and economically rendered, with details (rust, salt crust, mossy rocks, churning dark) filtered through Caleb’s professional eye. Setting is not just backdrop: the lantern room’s haunting, the steps, and the cliffside cairn directly shape his tactics and options. Recurring objects (lamp, sea glass, bottle, stones) charge the final image and embody the thematic stakes. Atmosphere (“luminescent ache”) is consistent and organically anchored in physical environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the lighthouse’s promise of safety, including for an unseen correspondent and a restless ghost—is clear from the lamp’s failure onward. Pressure escalates modestly via the growing ghostly presence and the symbolic risk that the sanctuary’s implicit contract might be broken. Caleb’s choice to bottle the sea glass and reaffirm the letter ritual is a genuine, if quiet, narrowing of options that re-commits him to this burden of care. The conflict remains largely internal and atmospheric, so tension is felt but never truly sharp.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of safety, loneliness, unseen connection, and the burdens of caretaking emerge convincingly from the particulars of the lighthouse, the secret correspondence, and the ghost. The act of literally bottling a feeling and placing it in the letter-chain cairn ties premise and theme in a concrete, satisfying way. However, some lines verge on thesis (“The lamp may falter, but the feeling of safety, once bottled, never fades”; “safety bottled”) and lightly undercut subtext. The final sense of “luminescent ache” lingers, offering resonance beyond neat moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is stable, gentle, and slightly lyrical, matching Caleb’s temperament and the maritime setting. Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent, with recurring phrasing (“luminescent ache,” “feeling of safety”) working more as motif than crutch, though they edge toward overuse. POV modesty is sound; we never leave Caleb’s knowledge or perception. The voice is pleasant and distinctive enough for publication but could risk a bit more idiosyncrasy to feel singular at a top-tier level.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and generally economical; most sentences carry both atmosphere and story. Imagery is coherent and tactile (sea glass “smooth as a whisper,” stones like “silent sentinels”) without descending into muddled metaphor. There is some conceptual repetition around safety, luminescence, and ache that slightly flattens momentum but does not obscure sense or closure. Line-level craft is solidly above average but not yet razor-honed for maximal compression.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>A haunted lighthouse and ghostly presence are familiar ingredients, but the anonymous letter chain, stone-stacking code, and literal bottling of safety give the setup a fresh inflection. The integration of these elements into a quiet emotional arc feels organic rather than gimmicky. Still, the emotional and plot patterns (solitary keeper, benevolent ghost, recommitment to duty) track recognizable templates and do not quite surprise in their moral calculus. The result is graceful and appealing but not yet strikingly original for a “prestige” market.</comment>
