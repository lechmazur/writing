<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sensei’s interior arc from post–ego-death numbness to reintegrated feeling is clear, motivated, and paid for with concrete cost (“grief stabbed through him like a tanto blade”). His core contradiction—valuing enlightenment/emptiness yet reaching for the jarred brain—is dramatized rather than merely stated. The clones are more symbolic modes (duty/legacy/technique) than individuated people, which slightly flattens relational pressure. Still, his final synthesis feels credibly earned by prior setup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: timeline fracture → clones and temporal instability → imminent solidification → sensei chooses vivify/integration → clones collapse and history resolves. Closure is a decisive change with clear cost: he reclaims feeling and stabilizes reality at the price of grief and the loss of his prior transcendence. World rules (ego death, vivify, complementary opposites) are compressed but consistent enough in a mythic mode. The structure holds as a single intensifying scene without orientation issues.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo, vast sky, and temporal storm are vivid and tonally apt, mirroring his inner void and later reconstruction. Environmental shifts (dojo flickering between “ancient and newborn,” then crumbling) effectively echo and charge the closure. However, the setting rarely constrains concrete choices; the same arc could mostly occur in a non-floating dojo. Strong atmosphere and symbolic integration, slightly less strong as a functional constraint on action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—who gets to exist and whether to restore feeling—is legible early and narrows toward the choice to vivify and integrate. Pressure escalates once the temporal storm threatens to “solidify them into permanent, separate beings,” creating a clear now-or-never decision. The climax is internally driven, but the clones mostly freeze rather than actively contest, so opposition feels more conceptual than dynamically antagonistic. Still, the cost of his decision (return of pain, loss of pure emptiness) is clear on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The central theme—survival through integration rather than sterile transcendence—is coherent, grounded in his history of ego death and the literal merging with the DUPLICATE brain. The last act offers potent images (tears cutting “salt trails,” stepping off the dissolving edge) that embody the thematic stance. However, several lines slide into explicit moralizing (“No more katas without heart, no more technique without soul, no more enlightenment without the mess of being alive”), reducing subtext and ambiguity. The insight feels earned but over-articulated for top-tier literary subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and suitably elevated for a mythic martial-arts metaphysical tale. It maintains a coherent psychic distance, blending close interior access with declarative world-framing without head-hopping. Some sentences verge on authorial thesis rather than character-filtered perception, which slightly undercuts the sense of a fully character-bound voice. Overall, the rhythm and diction are distinctive and mostly well-managed under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose is often strong and image-rich (“light arced between them in silver-blue veins,” “stones melting like ice in the sun of causality”) with good momentum and clear sequencing. There is occasional purple or redundant abstraction, especially in the final thematic paragraphs, where ideas are reiterated rather than sharpened. Figurative density sometimes piles on instead of varying texture, but it rarely obscures meaning. Line-level craft is solid and publishable, though a stringent edit could trim excess and heighten impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of clone-custody metaphysics, ego death, a floating rock dojo, and a literal brain-in-a-jar backup is striking and feels like a specific, non-template vision. The resolution—choosing neither original nor duplicate but a painful integration that reweights “enlightenment”—is a fresh angle on well-trodden transcendence tropes. The temporal rewriting backdrop and emotional architecture backup push the concept beyond familiar martial arts mysticism. Some thematic articulations are familiar, but the overall combination and execution read as genuinely original.</comment>
