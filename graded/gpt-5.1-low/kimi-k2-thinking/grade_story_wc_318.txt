<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eleanor’s motivation—to restore her daughter’s laughter—is vivid, specific, and drives every choice, especially the calibrated use of the pull cord so as not to push Sarah into madness. Her interiority feels particular (“mournfully eager,” “spectral heart a bruised fruit”) and her acceptance of fading at the end reads as an earned cost. Sarah is sketched mainly through behavior (dishwashing freeze, plate drop, cracked laughter, phone call), which keeps her from becoming a mere symbol. The mother’s contradictory impulses (urgent need to help vs. restraint so as not to harm) are dramatized cleanly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The structure is cleanly causal under an accumulative/textural lens: Eleanor’s death → tunnel → wind-lullaby haunting → Sarah’s reaction → adjusted haunting → sibling reconnection → Eleanor’s release. Closure is strong and on-page: Eleanor’s cord dissolves and she begins to thin just as the house “begins to thaw,” a resonant reconfiguration with clear emotional cost. The echo tunnel and cord recur as through-lines, preventing the lyricism from feeling formless. There are no orientation or causality slips; the piece sustains one coherent arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The echo chamber tunnel, house above, and autumn wind are sensually and functionally integrated: the tunnel amplifies sound, carries lullabies, and later captures the siblings’ voices, while the cord is a concrete interface between realms. Details are selective and purposeful (“concrete walls slick with memory and groundwater,” “wind…like a choir of broken kazoos”), and the micro-setting constrains the haunting method rather than being decorative. The final image of the tunnel keeping her music recharges the opening and charges the environment with ongoing meaning. A touch more physical choreography of the house/tunnel relationship might heighten it to the very top tier, but as is it’s highly effective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Eleanor helping Sarah grieve without unmooring her sanity—is clearly signaled and tightened through the escalation from soft wind to howling, from plate-shattering to laughter, and then Eleanor’s conscious easing off. Her agency directly drives the central turns: pulling harder, then moderating, then one last gentle pull after overhearing the siblings. The emotional cost is legible in Eleanor’s felt “proper weight of her own absence” and her dissolution, even though the conflict remains quiet and internal rather than oppositional. The pressure arc is convincing but more a steady swell than a sharp crucible, which holds it just shy of the very highest band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of grief, the work of tending the unspoken, and what a “true haunting” might be emerge organically from actions (the macerating wind, the off-key lullabies, the call between siblings). The recurring images—leaf blower symphony, macerated silence, the tunnel—shift meaning by the end toward caretaking rather than fear. However, the final paragraph edges into explicit thesis (“A true haunting does not frighten; it holds… It tends to what we cannot say”), which slightly undercuts the otherwise implicit resonance. Even so, the emotional aftereffect is strong and specific rather than sentimental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The third-person voice is close to Eleanor yet allows brief, clean access to Sarah’s external reactions without head-hopping into her mind, maintaining a coherent focal lens. Diction and rhythm are distinctive and controlled, with playful grotesquerie (“choir of broken kazoos,” “cymbal’s sharp kiss”) balanced against tenderness. Psychic distance modulates well: more expansive and metaphorical around the haunting, tighter around key beats like Sarah’s cracked laughter or the cord dissolving. The slightly essayistic closing lines about what haunting is are tonally consistent but a bit more expository than the rest.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is vivid and information-dense; most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and psychology without obvious scaffolding. Recurring metaphors of maceration and sound rarely feel redundant and help unify the texture instead of looping meaninglessly. There is some risk of lyrical overload (“mournfully eager tune,” “bruised fruit,” “macerated the hard silence”), but syntax remains clear and momentum steady, and no figurative muddle obscures causality or closure. Line-level control is strong enough for elite venues, with only a hair’s breadth of purple at the thematic wrap-up.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The combination of a leaf-blower “symphony conductor,” an echo-chamber tunnel, and grief-work via off-key wind and half-sung lullabies feels genuinely fresh within the ghost/haunting subgenre. The idea of haunting as caretaking that “macerates silence” rather than frightening is a non-obvious but inevitable-feeling reframing by the end. Specific choices—the tacky pull cord grip as ritual object, the plate crash joining the “symphony,” the tunnel archiving her music—are imaginative rather than generic. It stops short of radical formal innovation, but the conceptual and imagistic synthesis is distinctive and memorable.</comment>
