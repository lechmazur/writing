<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The survivor’s fear, embodied in counting heartbeats and carrying the shard, is specific and consistent, and her choice to defragment the ghost to “fetch wisdom” is well motivated. Interior texture is strong but skews contemplative rather than conflicted; we rarely see truly contradictory impulses operating at once. Her final reorientation—carrying the shard as lesson rather than loss—feels earned by prior causality. The absence of on-page relationships limits the crucible for deeper character complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The structure is clean: she arrives with a goal, engages the ghost via ink and shard, completes the defragmentation, then reinterprets her own “clerical death” through that experience. Causality under a mostly accumulative/textural lens holds: each step (ink mapping, shard contact, ghost’s revelations) deepens rather than resets the situation, and closure lands as a conceptual repricing of failure and identity. The late flashback to the death-certificate event is anchored and clearly tied back to the present frame. Stakes are modest and largely internal, but they cohere without structural confusion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The opal observatory, snow, old-circuit air, ink, and porcelain shard create a vivid, coherent atmosphere, and the recurring objects (ink, shard, terminal) meaningfully charge the final image. The environment functions mostly as mood and metaphor rather than as a hard physical constraint, but the observatory and “machine” heartbeat parallel the protagonist’s ghosted status in a way that feels integral. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, rarely lapsing into cataloguing. The shard and ink in particular operate as effective micro-settings that frame action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reclaiming a livable identity and meaning after being misfiled as dead—is signaled early and coherently tied to her efforts with the ghost. Pressure does tighten as she moves from static listening to actively tracing ink, merging shard with terminal, and finally accepting the ghost’s mirror claim about her heart. However, the conflict remains largely internal and contemplative; there is little sense of risk if she fails, and no real competing obligation or cost beyond emotional discomfort. The escalation is sufficient for a quiet piece but not especially bracing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of failure as map, fracture as guide to mending, and the kinship between digital and bureaucratic ghosts are well seeded and recur in concrete images (shattered teacup, splintered code, cracks). The final realization—that she will “mend her own life as she had mended the ghost” and carry the shard as a token of lesson—is coherent and emotionally plausible. However, the ghost’s line “In failure, there is a map; each crack teaches the path to mend” and later paraphrases edge into direct thesis-statement territory, softening subtext into moral. The resonance is genuine but somewhat over-explained.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The third-person limited voice is steady, lyrical, and well controlled, with a distinct texture (“rose from the snow like a frozen thought,” “air tasted of old circuits and winter”). Psychic distance remains consistent, and the brief ghost dialogue fits the established tone without jarring register shifts. The narrative confidently balances concrete image with abstraction, and there is no POV leakage or gratuitous exposition. Some lines (“write a new chapter”) feel more conventional than the rest, but they don’t break voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose is generally strong, with varied rhythm, high information density, and evocative metaphors that mostly hold (“ink spread like nerves,” “ghost file,” “quiet curtain over the opal dome”). There is some conceptual and lexical repetition around “failure,” “map,” “fragmented/fractured,” and “lesson learned” that slightly blunts impact and introduces a faint sense of scaffolding. A few closing phrases lean toward cliché compared to the more original early images. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are maintained, and no figurative muddle undermines the ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a clerical death, a digital ghost of failed memory capture, an opal observatory under snow, and ink-based defragmentation via porcelain shard is fresh and memorable. The mirroring between bureaucratic error and experimental failure, and between human heartbeat and machine pulse, feels conceptually integrated rather than gimmicky. While the underlying lesson about failure and resilience is familiar, the specific mechanics (ink as nerve-mapping, shard as bridge between ceramic and data) give it a distinctive inflection. The piece takes stylistic and conceptual risks within a controlled frame that mostly pay off.</comment>
