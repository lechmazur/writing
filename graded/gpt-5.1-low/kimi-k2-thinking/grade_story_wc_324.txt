<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s compassion and curiosity are clear and consistent, and their choice to follow the pulse and then intervene is well motivated. However, interior conflict is light: they rarely experience contradictory impulses or genuine hesitation under pressure. The “contact tracer for hearts” concept gives personality but is not deeply probed for flaws or blind spots. The final stance (renewed purpose) feels earned but carries limited visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: hearing the pulse → misattributing it to the dead → discovering the collapsing man → intervening → paramedics arriving → narrator’s purpose reconfigured. Orientation is strong; we always know where we are and what’s happening, and the twist that the pulse is living rather than dead is coherent and grounded. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator’s role shifts from medium of the dead to protector of both dead and living. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than sharply dramatized, which keeps it below top-tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium, stone pillars, marble floor, and dew-slicked surfaces create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that meshes with the liminal dead-calling hour. Details are selective and purposeful, repeatedly tying setting to mood and function (echoing pulses, fog, glass shattering). The photograph and the hearing aid operate as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, but it does heavily charge tone and thematic space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The central stake—whether faint pulses belong to the dead or to someone in immediate danger—emerges clearly and tightens with the crash and discovery of the man. There is a meaningful escalation from quiet listening to urgent physical intervention. Still, the conflict lacks a hard trade-off or deeper moral calculus; once the man appears, the correct course is obvious and unambiguous. The internal and external stakes align smoothly, perhaps too safely for a higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of listening, liminality between living and dead, and unplanned/“incidental” heroism are coherent and arise from concrete events and recurring images (pulses, photograph, mist, hush). The idea of protecting vulnerable voices is dramatized rather than purely stated. However, the ending edges toward mild explicitness (“for this is my purpose: to listen, to protect, to assure”), nudging into near-thesis territory. Resonance lingers, but the piece leans slightly on articulation where an image-only close could have been stronger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The first-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through the narrator’s sensibility; phrases like “contact tracer for hearts” and “reeling hush” feel voice-specific rather than generic. Psychic distance is steady, and the narration’s certainty matches what the character can plausibly know. Dialogue is sparse but natural and functional. At times the lyricism borders on over-patterned, but it remains controlled and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythm and strong sensory images that maintain momentum rather than stall it. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and layered (“voices thin as fog,” “curiosity flares like a struck match”). There is some repetition of motifs and a slight drift toward purple in places, yet it rarely muddies clarity or causality. Minor tightening could trim redundancy, but line-level craft is clearly above-average.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The notion of a “contact tracer for hearts” using a decades-old hearing aid to listen when the dead call is a fresh, memorable premise. The twist that the pulse belongs to a living man, and that heroism arises incidentally from misinterpretation, gives the piece a distinctive angle. The atrium and mist setting, plus the tonal commitment to hush and liminality, feel more singular than templated. While not radically experimental, the synthesis of concept, tool, and theme is notably original.</comment>
