<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The keeper’s desire to uncover what happened to the missing engineers is clear and consistent, and her key choices (lying to the AI, copying the video, creating the mirror) align with that drive. However, she experiences little visible internal contradiction or fear, so the emotional cost of defying the corporation remains mostly implied. Her interiority is serviceable but generic at points (“felt the weight of a thousand vanished voices”), with limited character-specific texture beyond her role. The closing shift toward quiet hope is believable but not hard-earned on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The causal throughline—from noticing the numbers, to investigation, to lying for access, to uploading the video—reads coherent and accumulative, and the ending offers a resonant reconfiguration (she’s turned passive archivist into active subversive. Closure is present: the cold case is no longer “cold,” and her creation of the mirror forecloses silent complicity. However, obstacles are minimal and easily passed (the security AI is defeated in a sentence; the sealed vault opens without friction), so escalation feels low-risk. The repeated return to the numbers and songs gives an accumulative structure, but some beats feel like restatements rather than new turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The archive—with humming servers, corrupted blocks, backup tapes, and a sealed vault—is vivid and meaningfully tied to her work and to the theme of digital ghosts. The mission patch functions as a small, recurring object that charges the atmosphere and final image. Environmental details (archive vs. humming city vs. private apartment) are selective and tonally aligned rather than touristic. The setting could constrain choices more concretely under pressure, but at this length it serves character, tone, and theme well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering suppressed truth about the missing engineers versus corporate erasure—is clear but largely conceptual, with little concrete jeopardy. There is one major tightening beat (her decision to forge the clearance token and access the vault), and another when she chooses to upload the video externally and erase logs. However, no path is visibly foreclosed with cost: the corporation’s surveillance, potential punishment, or personal risk never come onstage as active pressure. As a result, tension remains steady but modest rather than truly escalating.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Themes of memory vs. erasure, corporate control of history, and the persistence of the “absent” emerge clearly through the recurring motifs of ghosts, numbers, and songs. The patch, the mirror, and the closing sense of the missing becoming present in “every byte, every note, every number” offer real resonance. Yet the piece leans into explicit thematic statement (“truth, like data, never truly disappears”; “some things cannot be erased”) that borders on moralizing rather than trusting implication. Complexity—especially around the ethics or danger of her defiance—is gestured at more than dramatized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The third-person limited voice is stable and cohesive, with a consistent lyrical, slightly solemn diction that suits the subject. Refrains like “ghosts,” “echo of forgotten songs,” and the number string create a recognizable texture. However, the voice sometimes drifts toward template-poetic phrasing rather than an idiosyncratic, character-specific idiom, and the rhythm can feel monotone in its solemnity. Even so, POV control is clean and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prose is generally clean, grammatical, and readable, with some strong images (backup tapes as a “mournful hum”) and efficient sentences. However, there is heavy repetition of concepts and phrases—especially “echo of forgotten songs,” “ghosts,” and the number sequence—without each recurrence adding new information or pressure. Several adjacent lines paraphrase the same idea of persistence of memory/absence, which blunts momentum. The lyric mode is apt, but tighter line-level pruning and more variation in imagery would significantly sharpen impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The core synthesis—corporate archivist as detective of erased lives inside a monolithic social network—has real promise and some freshness. The use of recurring numbers embedded in logs and songs as a hidden signature is a strong organizing device, though the specific sequence evokes a well-known pop-cultural reference and thus feels a bit derivative. Structural risks are modest; this is more a polished execution of familiar cyber-noir/ghost-in-the-machine tropes than a radical reimagining. It’s solidly engaging but not yet singular or surprising at a top-tier level.</comment>
