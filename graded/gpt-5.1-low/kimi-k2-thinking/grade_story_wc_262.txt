<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation (to locate and rescue unused love before demolition) is clear, consistent, and builds naturally into the final acceptance of carrying the Rialto’s archive. Interiority is specific (“her spatially imaginative mind mapping each wire as constellation memory”) and embodied, though her internal conflict around becoming this vessel and around Elena’s memory could be dramatized more directly instead of mostly implied. The moment she recognizes her own unused love in the booth is a strong, character-particular turn that earns the eventual burden she takes on. The arc is an earned endurance/renunciation, but a touch more friction or hesitation at the cost would deepen it further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The structure is cleanly accumulative: discovery of the film → psychometric reading → incubation → revelation that the Rialto is a storage architecture → transfer of love into Mira → departure. Causality within the lyric frame holds and the closure (Conceptual Repricing plus Earned Stasis) is legible: the building’s soul migrates into her at real cost. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is taught early and maintained; the demolition deadline adds a faint situational clock without over-complicating. One could argue the incubation step is somewhat hand-waved mechanically, but it doesn’t break the internal logic or closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The projection booth and palace are rendered with vivid, selective specificity (“hot metal and celluloid ghosts,” “gap between seat G12 and G13”) that is always POV-filtered and thematically active. The setting is not postcard; its architecture and micro-spaces literally store the unused love and constrain what Mira can perceive and do, and the final image of her leaving the now-empty palace is charged by that knowledge. The recurring objects-as-setting (booth, staircase curves, seats, sidewalk cracks) clearly shape the story’s conceptual stakes and the closure image. Environment, tools, and architecture are indispensable to both action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (can Mira locate and preserve unused love before demolition) is clear, and there is one meaningful tightening when the film dissolves into a map and she realizes she must personally carry the accumulated love. Escalation is primarily internal/conceptual rather than conflictual, appropriate to the lens but keeping pressure in a narrow band. The cost—bearing ninety years of unspent love and leaving the building to its fate—is present and felt, though the demolition deadline doesn’t actively pinch her choices on the page. A moment of more explicit dilemma (e.g., resisting or negotiating that burden) would strengthen the sense of narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme—unused love as neither vanished nor harmless, but changing address into spaces and objects—is richly developed through concrete particulars (seat gaps, balcony rails, projection angles) rather than abstract commentary. The notion of goodbye letters as transfer protocols and buildings as vaults gives a fresh, resonant answer to the central question by the end. The final paragraphs extend the idea beyond the Rialto (sidewalk cracks, the next palace), reweighting the entire story without slipping into overt moralizing. A few sentences (e.g., “for crystal gazers know what others forget”) approach thesis-statement territory, but they’re brief and integrated enough not to feel like sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The third-person close voice has a distinctive, consistent texture—lyric, image-heavy, and keyed to Mira’s sensibility (“silver screen’s hidden reels,” “hushed thunder of revelation”). Psychic distance is stable, with no head-hopping, and the rhythm modulates well between dense metaphor and clearer expository bridges. Diction is elevated but coherent with the slightly mythic register of a “last crystal gazer” in an old palace. There’s mild repetition of certain constructions (“spatially imaginative mind,” “hushed thunder”), but it reads as motif rather than leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is lush and largely precise, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept; images like “love unused…became dense as neutron star matter” and “each step writing new letter into pavement’s latent silver” are striking and legible. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled, with only occasional verge into purple or conceptual redundancy (“forgotten lyrics searching tune” is reused a bit). Sentence rhythm varies and momentum rarely stalls despite the lyric density. A light line edit to trim a few repeated motifs and slightly overloaded phrases would bring it to elite polish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The central conceit—cinema architecture as a literal storage medium for unsaid love, made legible via psychometry and film incubation—is unusual, coherent, and followed through with integrity. Familiar tropes (haunted theater, last show, psychic reader) are fully transformed by specific, inventive choices like goodbye letters on each frame and love compacting into gravitational “nodes” in physical gaps. The final conceptual turn that love “simply changes address” and migrates into Mira and then into the world is a non-obvious but inevitable-feeling synthesis of prior images. The piece takes a formal risk with dense, metaphor-driven accumulation and largely earns it.</comment>
