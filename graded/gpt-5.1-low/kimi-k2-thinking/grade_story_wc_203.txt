<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marlon is sharply sketched through his occupation, habits of perception, and long-running obsession with ceilings; the ghost-witness angle feels lived-in rather than gimmicky. His motivation to decode what the dead want and his final choice to take one barrel read coherent and earned. Internal contradiction is lighter—he rarely feels truly torn, just resigned and curious—which keeps the characterization from the very top band. Still, his worldview and micro-choices (reading dust, climbing, pocketing one object) are specific and revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The structure is clean: a single, continuous scene that moves from malfunctioning light to ghostly manifestation to discovery and then to a reweighted exit. Causality is strong under a mostly accumulative lens—the lights die, the dust pattern cues attention upward, the mainspring amplifies the ghosts, and the cache of barrels reframes the haunt as testimony. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: Marlon’s role shifts from fixer to permanent witness with an ongoing psychic cost. The only thing keeping it from a higher band is that the escalation feels relatively safe and observational, with no moment where options dramatically narrow beyond the ethical realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office is vivid and functional, from buzzing fluorescents and dust spirals to false ceilings and cracked façades; we always know where we are and why it matters. Environment and micro-setting constrain action: only by climbing onto the counter and into the ceiling space can Marlon uncover the truth, and the circus context makes the engraved names and wage-theft resonance possible. The final image of the cracked façade breathing secrets grants the setting a thematic afterlife. This is top-tier work for length, just shy of 9-band only because the spatial and physical risks in the environment remain low.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The stakes are primarily moral and epistemic—will Marlon respond to the ghosts’ demand for witness or treat this as another job—and they focus nicely on his ongoing haunting. Escalation is there: malfunction → presence of ghosts → activation via the barrel → discovery of the hidden wages → decision to carry a burden. The cost is conceptual rather than immediate danger, but the text makes that cost explicit in the “spring wound tight beneath his ribs” and in how the ghosts finally release him. It’s strong but not searing; at no point does he plausibly consider refusal or failure, so tension stays more atmospheric than agonizing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of hidden labor, time, and the ethics of bearing witness are tightly woven through objects (mainsprings), setting (ceilings, façades), and Marlon’s vocation. The ghosts’ line “We wound the clocks. We kept the time. But time forgot us” elegantly crystallizes exploitation without over-explaining. The ending slightly edges into abstract thesis language—“silenced mechanisms of ordinary cruelty”—which feels a touch didactic compared to the richer images. Even so, the conceptual repricing of “what’s above” from heaven to structural cruelty lands with real resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The third-person limited voice has a clear, controlled texture: technical, observant, and slightly haunted, matching an elevator technician with an eye for patterns. Diction and rhythm are consistent, with nice modulations between concrete occupational detail and lyric turns (“dust itself became a language”). There is mild slide into editorial abstraction near the end, but it doesn’t break POV or clarity. Overall, the perceptual signature feels distinct and steady.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line by line, the prose is tight, image-rich, and generally free of scaffolding or loops; most sentences carry multiple weights (world, mood, character) efficiently. Metaphors like dust spirals as “choreography” and ghosts like “damaged film reels” are vivid and coherent with the visual/temporal motif. A few phrases verge on purple or essayistic (“architectural longing, a structural grief”; “silenced mechanisms of ordinary cruelty”), but they don’t obscure sense or momentum. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the piece propulsive and readable at this length.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The blend of elevator repair, ghost testimony, circus ruin, and horological wage-theft is genuinely fresh, especially the use of mainspring barrels as frozen, unpaid time. The focus on ceilings as sites of hidden cruelty rather than transcendence offers a non-obvious thematic pivot. The story also avoids easy horror tropes in favor of a quiet, morally charged haunting. It falls just shy of the very top originality band only because the final moral framing leans on somewhat familiar “ordinary cruelty” language instead of fully trusting its singular images.</comment>
