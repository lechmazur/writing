<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation and vocation are clear and specific, and her actions (saving the negative, returning with equipment, compiling and sending the report) align well with her drive to “discover what walls dream about.” However, internal conflict is mostly gestured at (“burden,” “obsession”) rather than dramatized through competing impulses in particular moments. The emotional arc from obsession to purpose is convincing but somewhat smoothed over in summary rather than felt through difficult micro-choices. This keeps the characterization strong but short of truly deep, conflicted interiority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The accumulative structure—discovery of diaries/negative → development of the image → decision to map and share the corridor’s dream → sending out the report—reads coherent and causally linked under a textural lens. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: legacy’s burden is reweighted from shame to directive, with the final message “Remember, but act” clearly marking a before/after. Some late-stage developments (“weeks in the passage,” movement-wide impact) are summarized rather than dramatized, slightly diluting the sense of on-page cost at the ending. Still, orientation is clean and the drive lens holds consistently.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned university and ivy-veiled passage are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through Mira’s sonic perception, giving the setting a lived, eerie specificity (walls “dream,” corridors “breathe easier”). Environmental elements—stone absorbing intention, frost-vine hybrids, the cracked ceiling admitting milky sun—are not mere backdrop but deeply entwined with the premise and final image. The corridor itself becomes a character whose “dream” shifts, directly charging the ending. This tight integration of place, mood, and thematic function is a major strength.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Mira can transform inherited, suppressed knowledge into purposeful, restorative action—is clear, but the on-page pressure remains relatively low and abstract. Discoveries unfold smoothly, with little resistance or felt risk beyond generalized emotional weight; there is no moment where a real option is foreclosed or a meaningful trade-off is dramatized. The escalation is primarily informational (learning the formula, recognizing its suppression, then disseminating it) rather than conflict-driven. This keeps tension present but muted, more contemplative than truly testing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—how legacy’s burden can shift from paralyzing guilt to active responsibility—is coherent and well-rooted in the premises of echo-cartography and climate collapse. Recurring motifs (walls’ dreams, the diaries, the negative) support this reweighting. However, the story increasingly explains its own thesis in abstract terms (“Legacy’s burden was not to mourn what was lost but to rebuild what was possible”), tipping into overt moralizing in the final third. That explicitness blunts complexity and subtext just enough to hold the piece below a higher literary tier.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The third-person-limited voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly colored by Mira’s professional and sensory bias, yielding a distinctive perceptual signature. Diction is largely consistent and apt for both the character and speculative-literary aims, with nice rhythmic variety. Some repeated phrases (“sensitively perceptive,” “through the half-burned diaries, she glimpsed”) and slightly generic abstractions in later thematic statements keep the voice from feeling razor-honed at the highest level. Overall, though, POV control and tonal consistency are strong.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is generally polished: sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and information-dense, with vivid images like the negative’s emulsion “cracked like dried riverbed.” There is some redundancy and phrase recycling, particularly around key motifs and the “sensitively perceptive” tag, creating a mild sense of scaffolding. A few abstractions and thesis-like sentences in the final section slightly slow momentum and reduce the sharpness of the closing image. These are notable but not structural issues in otherwise solid prose.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The central conceit of a “corridor echo cartographer” reading walls’ sonic fossils of human time, paired with climate-collapse and suppressed climatological warnings, feels fresh and thoughtfully synthesized. The negative strip, diaries, and dreaming corridor create a memorable fusion of haunted-archive SF and lyrical mythos. The final reconfiguration of “legacy’s burden” into a forward-driving compass is thematically satisfying and non-obvious. While some individual lines lean familiar, the overall imaginative stance and integration of concept and character are notably original.</comment>
