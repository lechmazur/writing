<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The engineer has clear, coherent motivation (duty to the lighthouse/sacred artifact) and a distinct inner split between training (“parse fear as frequency”) and compassion for the parasite. Her emotional life is embodied in sound, temperature, and pressure, not generic feeling labels. The main limitation is that we see only one mode of her—high-competence, high-empathy under duress—without much sense of her flaws beyond costly empathy. The final shift (her heart now tuned differently) is earned but could land harder if more of her pre-scene baseline or potential blind spots were dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: trapped at the marina → shadow-thing rises → demand for the flute → she chooses adaptation via sonic tools → dissolution and afterimage of the drowned keeper. The drive lens reads primarily causal with lyric coloration, and closure is a decisive change plus resonant reconfiguration: the guardian freed, her role clarified, and her inner “tuning” altered. Cost is present but subtle—emotional exhaustion, changed heart rhythm, ongoing duty rather than release; nothing undercuts it. Structure is a single, contained scene that escalates logically without orientation or rule-breaking issues.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina and lighthouse world are vividly and economically realized through concrete sensory detail—bronze taste, frozen kelp, snapping coat, rose-gold mirror ice. Environment genuinely constrains choice (boats locked in ice, forced to confront the shadow here and now) and then participates in the solution (the ice singing, forming a bridge). World rules around sound, frequency, and spiritual physics are internally consistent and revealed through action rather than infodump. The final tableau of still, rose-gold ice and emerging stars solidly charges the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—protecting the sacred artifact and resolving the lethal grief-frequency under the ice—is legible early and threads cleanly through the encounter. Escalation is clear: initial measurement of 7.8 Hz → emergence and threat from the shadow-thing → tactical choice to match vibration and use the key and flute in concert. Her agency is decisive in shaping the outcome, and internal conflict (logic vs sorrow) colors how she engages, though the battle tips in her favor fairly swiftly, with minimal sense of real risk or potential failure. The emotional and ethical stakes are strong, but a sharper price or nearer brush with loss would elevate the pressure further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of grief, absolution, and the dual vocation of engineer/keeper emerge organically from the sonic metaphysics and her choices, not from abstract lecturing. The repeated translation of emotion into frequency/amplitude, and sorrow into music, builds a coherent exploration of how structured rationality and deep empathy can coexist and be necessary to each other. The final lines (“She had adapted, as engineers must, but she had also released…”) are a bit on-the-nose but still rooted in concrete events and images, not platitudes. The aftereffect is contemplative and specific rather than moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The close third-person voice has a strong, consistent signature: technical yet mythic, filtered through someone who genuinely thinks in terms of frequency, resonance, and instruments. Diction and imagery (e.g., “unburied grief and saltwater corpses,” “sorrow’s geometry”) feel unified rather than stitched, and shifts in rhythm track the scene’s emotional peaks well. There is no POV leakage or unjustified omniscience; even the drowned keeper’s relief is conveyed through her perception of light and vibration. The lyric compression is confident and legible throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, and motion) with striking but intelligible metaphors, and there are no real loops or scaffolding remnants. The prose borders on purple in places, with high metaphor density in nearly every line, but the vehicles are thematically coherent (sound, cold, metal, light) so clarity generally holds. Rhythm varies well, with some long, lush lines offset by shorter, grounding beats. A slightly leaner line in a few mid- and late-story sentences could sharpen momentum, but the closure image remains clear and potent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse engineering, sonic physics, and spiritual absolution feels genuinely fresh, especially in concretizing emotions as specific frequencies and using tools (key, flute) as tuned devices for grief-release. The “frequency parasite” guardian and the Schumann-resonance-like 7.8 Hz grief frequency ground the fantasy in quasi-scientific myth in a way that’s memorable. The final re-valuation of her role—balancing tactile precision and transcendent empathy—is a non-obvious but inevitable-feeling extension of the premise. It stops just short of the truly startling, but it’s distinctly above the genre median in originality and integration.</comment>
