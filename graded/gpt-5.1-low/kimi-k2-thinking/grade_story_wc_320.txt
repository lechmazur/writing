<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira’s competence, pragmatism, and stubborn curiosity are well realized, and her profession is convincingly embodied in how she works the equipment. Her motivation (mentor’s charge, last of her kind) is clear and consistent. The internal shift from “amplify the signal” to “become silence and listen” is earned but sketched more as idea than as conflicted emotion, with little push-pull between fear, ego, and surrender. A touch more contradiction or visible cost to discarding her identity as transmitter would deepen the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The structure is clean: problem established (unknowable shard), failed attempts summarized, new tactic chosen, executed, and paid off in a reconfigured understanding of the towers’ purpose. Causality is tight under a largely causal/accumulative lens—her choice to strip down and listen directly leads to the realization that the shard is a seed and to the tower’s transformation. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing and decisive change: the world’s communication paradigm flips from broadcasting to listening with a clear “before/after.” The cost is more conceptual than visceral but legible: she abandons her prior framework and commits to a long, solitary project.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The abandoned radio tower city over a black gorge is vivid and specific, with details like mossed steel, swaying platforms, and humming “ghost frequencies” giving a strong lived-in feel. The environment constrains and shapes action (she climbs, strips gear, rewires copper on the tower itself) rather than sitting as backdrop. Cosmic elements—the gorge, moon, and perigee—are integrated into atmosphere and theme, not just spectacle. The final image of the hundred dark towers “waiting” is strongly charged by everything we’ve learned about this setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The primary stake—can she decode or properly respond to the shard, on which “life and death” in this world implicitly depend—is clear, but largely conceptual rather than embodied in immediate danger. Escalation comes from her shift in tactics (discarding hardware and assumptions) and the increasing cosmic pressure of lunar perigee, culminating in the rewiring of the tower and the emergent tone. The resolution is earned by her altered stance, not by coincidence. However, the on-page pressure remains fairly serene; we’re told the stakes are survival, but we rarely feel that risk biting into her options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of listening versus broadcasting, beginnings nested in endings, and silence as generative rather than empty are rich and coherent with the concrete action of dismantling and rewiring. The “shard of hush as seed” image nicely reweights earlier material and aligns her internal arc with the world’s reconfiguration. That said, the thematic statements are frequently explicit (“Every ending… contained compressed within it the code for what came next”), edging into essayistic explanation rather than leaving more resonance in subtext. The wisdom feels mostly earned but could trust image and implication a bit more.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is confident, with a distinct texture that blends technical concreteness (“amplifier modules,” “copper wire”) and lyrical cosmology without losing control. Diction and rhythm are consistent with a highly skilled, quasi-poetic technician and stay stable under pressure. The narrative distance is well managed; we remain inside Mira’s perceptual lens without unjustified omniscience or head-hopping. The few meta/abstract phrasings still feel like her thoughts rather than authorial intrusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and generally do more than one job, keeping momentum despite a reflective bent. Figurative language (“silence as presence,” “geometry of patience”) is frequent but controlled and thematically aligned, rarely muddling sense. There’s minimal scaffolding or synonym loops; most lines advance scene or concept. The prose edges toward purple in a few spots, but clarity and propulsion remain intact, including at the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The combination of celestial signal interpreter, “shard of hush,” and a city of decaying radio towers repurposed from transmitters to listeners is fresh and memorable. The piece commits to its premise, following through on the implications of silence-as-technology rather than using it as mere metaphor. The final reconfiguration—towers as patient listeners seeded by fallen star fragments—feels both surprising and inevitable given earlier beats. A slightly more idiosyncratic emotional knot in Mira could push this into truly exceptional territory.</comment>
