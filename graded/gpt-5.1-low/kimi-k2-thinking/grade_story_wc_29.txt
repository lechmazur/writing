<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s role, professional competence, and cautious hope are clearly and consistently motivated, and her decision to risk the station to protect the community tracks with what we know of her. However, interior conflict under peak pressure is more implied than dramatized; the risk to her career and safety never quite fractures her composure on the page. The story leans on summary (“spent three sleepless nights”) rather than fully embodying her psychological wear. The final endurance—remaining at WKUZ, still cautiously hopeful—feels earned but not deeply costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: escalating signals → discovery of subsonic manipulation → plan to interfere → dawn broadcast → partial communal reset. The drive lens is primarily causal with a light thematic overlay, and closure lands with a decisive change in the signal landscape plus lingering costs in human mistrust. There are no serious orientation issues; time (“each passing week,” “three sleepless nights,” then the dawn execution) and stakes remain clear. The main limitation is that institutional fallout and material risk are gestured at more than structurally tested, softening the sense of paid price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The radio station and campus are vividly evoked—peeling paint, burnt coffee, old vinyl—and these details are filtered through Mara’s professional and emotional lenses. The station’s aging equipment and the transmission tower are not just backdrop; they materially shape tactics and danger around the subsonic interference. The broader campus unrest (quad protests, faculty senate, student senate debate) coheres with the celestial manipulation and modulates the atmosphere. While the environment doesn’t fully choke her options, it does meaningfully constrain how and where she can fight back.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Mara can blunt the aliens’ manipulation before the community tears itself apart—is clear and escalates from abstract tension to an on-air, timed counterattack. The alien and institutional power pressures converge at the climax (risking equipment, career, and credibility during a live broadcast). However, the “dangerous” method pays off a bit cleanly: no visible backlash from the administration and no equipment failure, so the price feels more theoretical than enacted. Internal versus external stakes are interwoven but could use one sharper on-page loss or compromise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of division as a harvestable resource, information warfare, and the fragile possibility of human solidarity emerge organically from concrete events (archived broadcasts, protests, senate debates, cosmic tricksters). The story avoids tidy moralizing by noting that human grudges and mistrust persist even after the alien influence is blunted. The final image—a lone heart in a shabby booth pushing back with “static, stubborn faith”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer about resistance amid manipulation. Some phrasing edges toward explicit thesis (“celestial gaslighting,” “fed on the community's division”), but it still mostly lets scene and image carry the weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is controlled, with a distinct blend of technical lexicon and slightly lyrical metaphor that fits a scientifically trained but emotionally invested protagonist. Diction and rhythm are consistent, and free indirect access to Mara’s perceptions (“cosmic tricksters,” “celestial gaslighting”) gives the narrative a particular flavor. There is minimal dialogue, but Dr. Chen’s brief on-page presence reads plausibly and in line with his role. The main constraint is that the voice rarely pushes into truly idiosyncratic territory; it’s strong but not singularly unforgettable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft is generally tight: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and plot) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors like “paint peeled from the walls like dead skin” and “interference patterns now dissolving…like frost under sunlight” are vivid and legible, and figurative density stays just short of purple in high-pressure beats. Syntax varies enough to sustain momentum, and crucial causal steps are clear. A few formulations (“malevolent intent,” “cosmic tricksters”) verge on stock or on-the-nose, but they don’t materially blunt the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The fusion of campus radio, subsonic psychological manipulation, and “cosmic tricksters” gaming human division feels fresh and conceptually coherent. Using a counter-frequency broadcast as a kind of exorcism and framing it as “celestial gaslighting” gives the alien-contact trope a sharp, contemporary inflection. The institutional politics (dean, corporate sponsors, rival academic) are familiar but well-integrated into the SF premise rather than bolted on. It stops short of radically surprising structural or moral turns, yet the synthesis is strong and memorable.</comment>
