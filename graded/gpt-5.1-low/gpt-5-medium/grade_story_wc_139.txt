<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrator’s motives—honest work versus the family’s con-artist legacy—are sharply articulated and drive every choice, from aiding Arman to insisting on truthful paperwork. Interiority is specific and embodied (“air that tastes like coins,” the squeeze on the wrist), and the father’s shadow provides credible internal conflict without melodrama. The final stance—taking evidence instead of bribe—reads as an earned evolution of her ethics, not a sudden revelation. Arman is thinly drawn but functions credibly as a scared, disciplined co-agent under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: the prep-room job enables the ruse; the known alarm reset and director’s habits create the breach; their plan unfolds stepwise into Arman’s escape and the acquisition of incriminating account numbers. Stakes and options are legible throughout, and each beat (“He leaves the bolt hanging”; “the reset chime dings”) narrows their window plausibly. Closure lands both in Arman’s successful transfer to the van and the narrator’s new leverage for asylum, with clear conceptual cost for the corrupt officials. The drive feels primarily causal with a strong lyric overlay, and that lens holds through the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The funeral home prep room is intensely particular—“citrus, ethanol, and deathly vitality,” pumps and vents as a “calendar without numbers”—and every environmental detail serves tactic or mood. The setting directly shapes the plan (steel table, cart, service elevator, reset alarm, security camera) rather than feeling decorative. The ink pot functions as a micro-setting object whose properties (age, scars, blue ink) charge the final image and the narrator’s ethical calculations. Spatial and procedural choreography remain clear despite the lyric density.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—getting Arman to asylum as a form of fair trade—is clearly established and tightened through the director’s inspection, the alarm reset, and the brief, risk-filled corridor to the van. Escalation is subtle but effective: the knock at the door, the bolt left hanging, the camera cycling off/on, each constricting their margin. The narrator’s choice to take incriminating numbers instead of money and to trust legal channels heightens moral stakes at the end. The only limit is that external resistance remains relatively smooth; nothing truly threatens to derail the plan once the director leaves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—mathematics of fairness versus inherited fraud—is woven through concrete motifs (ledger, ink pot, “inverse function”) rather than abstract sermonizing. The asylum plot enacts, rather than states, the idea of an honest trade in a corrupt system, culminating in “I sign that I saw, that I held, that he chose to live and to testify.” The father’s “carnival math” contrasted with the narrator’s ledger-keeping and witness-signing gives the ending a resonant, non-literal answer about what fairness can look like in dirty systems. A few direct statements (“If I write, I must write the truth…”) flirt with explicitness but still feel earned by context.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility—mathematical, tactile, and steeped in deathwork. Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure (more clipped around the breach, more expansive in reflective lines) without losing clarity. Metaphors feel character-specific (“fairness is a curve, not a curtain”; “calendar without numbers”) and help define POV rather than sounding like generic lyricism. No POV slippage or register missteps under stress are evident.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line by line, the prose is dense yet purposeful; most sentences do multiple jobs (advancing action, deepening character, reinforcing motifs) with minimal redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but pattern-consistent and rarely feels strained; the imagery of ink, math, and mechanical breath builds a coherent texture. The closing sequence—from the alarm chime to the ink pot returning to the cabinet—lands with clarity and rhythm, without clutter or scaffold. I see no significant loops, mixed metaphors, or syntax artifacts that impede momentum or sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise—an embalmer in a corrupt family using a fake cadaver ruse to secure political asylum and a “fair trade”—feels strikingly original, both in situation and moral calculus. The fusion of mortuary detail, mathematical language of fairness, and the con-artist legacy produces a fresh thematic and tonal blend. The ink pot and ledger as instruments of both fraud and witness give the ending an inventive conceptual repricing. Risks in lyric density and metaphorical ambition pay off rather than reading as gimmick.</comment>
