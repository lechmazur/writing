<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The archivist’s motivation and worldview are sharply etched and consistent, and the woman’s grief and tentative hope feel specific and embodied (“breath she lost,” fingers on the knot, the locket clicking). The “haunted euphoria” is credible and character-particular rather than generic melancholy. Internal contradiction (tender archivist versus the almost ecstatic response to loss) is present but not fully dramatized as on-page conflict, which keeps this just shy of the very top band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → consultation → ritual of recounting proximate causes → jetty walk → reunion, with a clear before/after in the woman’s relational state and the archivist’s belief in his work. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive act, and the final image (“sealed the entry with salt”) has cost in the implied risk of renewed covenant. The man’s appearance at the end leans a bit on coincidence rather than a fully earned causal turn, which slightly softens the drive lens but doesn’t break it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The jetty, tide, sea thrift, and barnacled boards are not mere backdrop; they tightly inflect the ritual (walking the planks, locating the original photograph’s context, the sea as a “ledger of foam”) and charge the ending. Environmental specifics constrain action (the linear walk along the jetty, the tide as temporal pressure) and are thematically fused to memory and covenant. Minor reason for not going higher is that the setting shapes mood and symbolism more than overt tactical choices under pressure, even though it’s exquisitely rendered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The central stake—whether memory via “proximate causes” can recover or regenerate a broken covenant—is clear and deepens as they move from small details to the rupture and finally the tentative reunion. The main escalation is interior and textural rather than conflictual, with pressure rising through the layering of remembered minutiae and the woman’s embodied reactions. The late reappearance of the partner functions as a satisfying turn but sidesteps a fully agentive choice or trade-off, keeping the stakes from feeling as sharp as they might in a truly elite piece.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of memory, context, and how relationships are built from “proximate causes” are woven through objects (ink, locket, tide, ledger) and actions, culminating in the idea that archives preserve the conditions for covenant rather than the vows themselves. The final movements—their reunion framed through small shared moments instead of a declaration of forgiveness—offer a nuanced, earned answer to the premise. The last explicit statement of the archivist’s mission (“That is my work, and why I return…”) edges toward thematic over-articulation, slightly reducing the lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and internally consistent, with a strong perceptual signature in its metaphoric habits (“swallows stitched dusk to the sea,” “a gull let the wind hold it in a white parenthesis”). Elevated diction feels organic to this quasi-mystical archivist rather than tacked on, and psychic distance is well controlled. Dialogue is sparse but effective and embedded with subtext (“They talked not of forgiveness first, but of proximate causes”), keeping the voice unified across narration and speech.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet mostly disciplined; nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs—image, theme, and emotional shading—without major redundancy or confusion. The figurative density is very high, but metaphors stay coherent and motif-tied (ink, tide, steeping, ledgers), and action remains legible despite the lyricism. One could argue for a touch of overrichness that slightly blurs urgency, but it does not materially obscure causality or the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise of a walnut-ink archivist who reconstructs relationships via “proximate causes” on a tidal jetty is fresh, and the execution pushes beyond mere conceit into a fully realized mini-myth. Familiar elements (lost lovers, reunion) are transformed by the procedural, almost liturgical approach to memory and covenant, and the ending’s quietness feels like a deliberate artistic risk that pays off. Slightly softer causal stakes and reliance on coincidence keep this just under the very top originality band, but the synthesis is still striking and memorable.</comment>
