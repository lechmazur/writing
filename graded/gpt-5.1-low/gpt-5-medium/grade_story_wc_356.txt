<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrator’s ambition (“a restless root seeking stone”) and sensory curse create a distinct, consistent psyche whose choice to plant the corpse flower is fully motivated. Interiority is specific and embodied through scent and motion rather than generic feelings. Internal conflict (ambition vs. communal fear, attraction to rot vs. disgust) could surface more sharply in the planting moment, which now feels a bit too serene. The final softening into stewardship is earned, though the cost is more conceptual than viscerally dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The accumulative structure is clean: village unrest → arrival of seed/grandmother’s message → risky planting → overwhelming bloom → council breathing through the stink. Causality is coherent under a textural lens, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the bridges steady and the protagonist’s role shifts. The cost of the choice (stench, social risk, confrontation with grief) is on the page, if somewhat underplayed. Orientation—who/where/what kind of world—is quick and stable despite the lyric density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The treetop village, swaying bridges, and rope-convergence heart are vividly specific and always filtered through the herbalist’s wind-and-scent consciousness. Setting is not postcard: the hung homes, trembling bridges, and rope junction literally dictate where the seed must be planted and what’s at stake. Environmental conditions (wind hush, canopy currents, “turning of the tide’s thought”) directly shape when and how decisions are made. The final steadied bridges and communal breath are charged by all this accumulated spatial and sensory groundwork.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring serenity in a motion-sick village by embracing a taboo bloom—is clear and threaded from early ambition to the council’s climactic stillness. Pressure escalates via mounting communal unease and the social/spiritual risk of planting a corpse flower at the bridge’s heart. However, opposition remains mostly atmospheric and murmured; no concrete challenge or near-failure sharpens the planting or blooming beats. The cost is real but felt more as a brave acceptance of stink and grief than as a hard trade-off under acute external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of rot as a route to balance, grief as a guide, and “knowledge does not sit still but flows beneath choices” emerge organically from events and images, especially the corpse flower and the undercurrent motif. The flies’ lesson and grandmother’s four-word note avoid feeling like pasted-on morals because they are grounded in the protagonist’s sensory curse and family practice. The final image—journal as map of breath, ambition softening into stewardship—reframes the whole piece without overt sermonizing. A touch less explicit articulation of “wisdom” might heighten subtext over statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The first-person voice is confidently lyrical with a distinct perceptual signature centered on scent, motion, and vegetal metaphors. Phrases like “tide’s thought,” “storm sap,” and “world through currents of scent that stitched the canopy” create a cohesive, character-bound idiom rather than generic prettiness. Psychic distance is steady: reflective but anchored in concrete present actions (planting, drumming, inhaling the bloom). Under peak beats, the voice holds its texture without collapsing into abstraction or explanatory scaffolding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level writing is dense but controlled, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and interiority at once). Figurative language is abundant yet mostly coherent and thematically unified around motion, roots, and breath, avoiding mixed-metaphor muddle. There’s little redundancy or scaffolding; rhythm varies enough to keep the lyric mode from droning. A few constructions (“I journalize as I work”) risk slight stiffness, but they do not impede momentum or clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a scent-attuned herbalist in a treetop village, corpse flower as communal rite of grief, and the metaphysical “turning of the tide’s thought” feels genuinely fresh. Journals as doodled maps-recipes and flies as philosophers of rot are surprising yet integrated, not quirky for their own sake. The story commits fully to its premise—accepting stench and carrion beetles as a path to equilibrium—without hedging back into safer, prettier magic. The closure image (wildflower hush, map of breath, ambition→stewardship) reconfigures the premise in a non-obvious but inevitable way.</comment>
