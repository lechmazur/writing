<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The summoner’s motivation—to “hush a prophecy spoken in code” via listening rather than force—is clear, consistent, and particular. Interiority is implied through perception and choices rather than spelled out, but we do get a credible ethic (“I do not erase; I release what was trapped in noise”) that informs every action. Internal contradiction is subtle rather than dramatized—there’s little sense of fear or doubt despite the task being “simple and impossible”—which keeps this just below the very top tier. The relationship with the fox is atmospheric rather than a crucible, so pressure remains essentially solitary and internal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The structure is a clean, single-ritual arc with accumulative logic: arrive at the brook → deploy the wing → confront the resistant code → locate and loosen the “seam” → exit with a reconfigured future. Causality is coherent within the lyric-magic frame, and the drive lens (accumulative/textural) is taught early and held through closure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the prophecy’s path is altered, the brook and night are conceptually changed (“like water after stone is lifted”), and the future has “room” again. The main softness is that cost is more implied than sharply dramatized, keeping this shy of a 9-band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is richly specific and fully integrated: the brook, moon, fox, alder, and stones are all active participants in the ritual rather than backdrop. The environment constrains and enables tactics—the mapping literally depends on current, foam, and reflective surfaces—and the final image (wing, brook, altered night) is inseparable from place. Details are consistently filtered through the summoner’s sensibility (grammar of water, “moon threw a ladder upon the brook”) and evolve as the conflict shifts. The nocturnal haven’s rules (sound as “smoothed hush,” code in stones/fireflies) stay stable and do meaningful world-building at this length.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing an “iron noon” future—is clear and escalates when the code “balks at vanishing,” tightening into a concrete obstacle. Pressure functions mainly at a conceptual/ritual level, with the key turn being the summoner’s shift from general working to targeted attention at the “seam where time had snagged and raveled.” The resolution is earned by that focused, patient agency (“not pulling, only offering direction through stillness”), and the future’s options are reweighted on the page. However, the stakes remain somewhat abstract and emotionally cool, so the felt cost and tension never quite reach maximal intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A cohesive theme of listening-as-mercy, patience versus mechanization, and releasing rather than erasing runs through the entire piece and is embodied in concrete ritual acts. Recurring motifs (hush, grammar of water, code vs. silence, terrestrially cosmic scale) reweight themselves by the end so that the final charge (“listening keeps the world from hardening”) feels grounded rather than tacked on. There is slight explicitness in the closing moral articulation, which edges toward spelling out the thesis instead of trusting pure image. Nonetheless, the conceptual repricing of prophecy and future is strong and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is assured, distinctive, and consistent: a controlled, lyric third with a strong perceptual signature (syntax as “grammar,” arithmetic of the brook, “moonmilk,” etc.). Rhythm varies well, with short declarative sentences punctuating more sinuous ones, and the stance never slips into explanatory or prosaic register. The diction and metaphoric palette feel unified and apt for the mythic-intimate mode, especially under pressure at the code’s resistance and the final reprieve. There’s no head-hopping; the slight omniscient touches (“Somewhere distances away...”) are clearly framed and support the conceptual scope.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is very strong: dense but mostly precise imagery, minimal redundancy, and sentences that routinely do double duty for atmosphere and narrative motion. The metaphoric layering around sound, water, and code remains coherent; I see no mixed metaphors that impair clarity, and momentum rarely stalls despite high figurative density. A few phrases (“terrestrially cosmic” twice, “tranquil blaze”) edge toward self-consciousness but are thematically consistent rather than ornamental fluff. There are no noticeable syntactic templates or loops, and the closing cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>This is an unusually fresh synthesis: prophecy as code, ritual as “mapping silence,” and the mechanical apocalypse reframed through a quiet, anti-heroic act of attention. The origami wing, smoothed hush, and brook arithmetic feel idiosyncratic rather than generic fantasy props, and the conceptual turn—unwriting the future through listening—reads both surprising and inevitable in hindsight. The piece takes stylistic and conceptual risks (dense lyricism, abstract stakes) that cohere instead of feeling gimmicky. It would be hard to transpose this plot into another setting or voice without losing its core identity, which signals high originality.</comment>
