<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The keeper’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent, with his “softly persistent” temperament expressed through methodical, almost ritual choices (examining seams, testing the flower in the notch, sending the light-signal). Motivation is clear and rooted in character: he sees himself as an accountant of the sea’s dead, and decoding the gesture fits his self-imposed role. Emotional contradiction exists but is understated—duty vs. eccentricity, belief vs. uncertainty about the answering light—so the arc feels more like deepened endurance than a sharp turn. The final choice to answer and then erase the visible trace (“what is rescued does not need a shrine, only a witness”) is credibly earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Structure is tight: the inciting incident (dying stranger + Edelweiss + pointing) flows cleanly into investigation on the dock, discovery of the notch, recalled backstory of the girl, and culminates in the lighthouse signal. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is sound—each physical clue (notch, scratches, flower) and recalled image escalates toward the decision to send the specific light pattern. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the keeper fulfills the stranger’s request and adopts the ongoing burden of witness, with the ledger entry and swept dock marking an earned stasis with cost. Orientation (where, who, when) is clear early and remains coherent without any lens ambiguity at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly particular—“opal dock in mist,” gull behavior, harbor bar, ice-chiming winters—filtered through the keeper’s sensibility rather than as neutral description. Environment actively shapes choice: the notch between planks is the puzzle’s lock, the dock “keeping” pain explains the borrowed memory, and nautical twilight enables the coded lighthouse reply and the answering low light to be seen at all. The recurring micro-setting of dock/lantern/mist charges the final image of him holding “the flower and the light” as a kind of portable version of that liminal space. Weather and sea atmosphere are not decorative; they underpin the whole logic of communication and witness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to decode and honor the stranger’s final gesture—remains legible throughout, and pressure deepens as the keeper moves from abstract belief (“the tide keeps its own ledger”) into a concrete test of that belief (fitting the flower, reading the notch, sending the signal). The key tightening is the recognition that the gesture mirrors the girl’s long-ago code, turning a simple puzzle into a two-way promise between living and dead. Stakes are quiet but real: his self-concept as witness is on the line, and his decision to treat the faint answering light as enough is a meaningful, not cost-free, stance. The escalation is more contemplative than dramatic, yet it coheres under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—witnessed isolation, the ethics of remembrance, and the idea that signals between separated people can matter even without proof of reception—emerges organically from the concrete actions (knocking codes, flowers in notches, sweeping away shrines). The Edelweiss and ledger motifs reweight at the end: what began as a brittle object becomes a key to reciprocity (“the signal runs both ways”), and the ledger entry wrapped around a salt packet elegantly literalizes keeping the sea’s debts. The story resists moralizing; lines like “what is rescued does not need a shrine, only a witness” express an ethic through behavior rather than sermon. The final sense that “the answer felt its way through” offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s question about whether such gestures matter.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and controlled, with recurring patterns (“by observing gaps,” “they call me…”) that feel intentional rather than mechanical. Diction and metaphor are consistent with an eccentric, contemplative lighthouse keeper—sea, stone, light, ledgers—without drifting into registers that feel alien to him. Psychic distance is well-managed: we stay inside his perceptions while still allowing for measured, reflective commentary, and there’s no POV leakage or unexplained omniscience. The rhythm modulates effectively, from long, sinuous descriptive sentences to slightly tighter, more decisive lines around key actions (fitting the flower, swinging the lantern, sweeping the dock).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence carries more than one function (image, characterization, or thematic charge), and the metaphoric texture—stones, opal, ledgers, gaps—feels cohesive rather than overgrown. There are no significant redundancy loops or scaffolding sentences; the reflection about the girl and the dock’s stored pain advances both plot and theme. The prose approaches the edge of purple in places, but rhythm and clarity are preserved, and figurative language stays legible and grounded in the established world logic. The final paragraphs, in particular, balance abstraction with concrete action (writing the name, folding the page, sweeping the dock) in a way that keeps momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The combination of an eccentric lighthouse keeper, a coded Edelweiss signal, and the quasi-mystical notion of a dock that “returns” borrowed memories feels fresh and specific, even though lighthouses and the sea are familiar literary terrain. The central move—treating gaps, absences, and failed communications as investigative tools—gives the piece a distinctive conceptual spine. The closure image of holding “the flower and the light like a promise that can be borrowed but not owned” re-synthesizes these elements in a non-obvious but inevitable way. It’s original more through synthesis and emotional honesty than through any single wild conceit, which suits the story’s quiet ambitions.</comment>
