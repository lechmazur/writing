<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The janitor’s interiority is rich and specific—his mix of hiding, yearning for connection, and reverence for maintenance feels particular rather than generic. His arc from “came here to hide” to “polish them into guidance” is credibly earned by accumulated attentiveness to machines and ghosts. Contradictory impulses (fear vs. readiness, wanting repair vs. accepting transparency) are present on the page without over-explained psychologizing. The only small limit is that his prior life and the broken love remain abstract, keeping some potential emotional cost off-stage.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The structure is a clear accumulative lyric, moving from routine cleaning to meteor burst and power failure to the boundary-revealing map and final stance. Causality is soft but coherent: his ongoing attention to the station leads to understanding the machines, then to responding meaningfully when the system fails, which in turn precipitates the map revelation and boundary choice. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he reprices his purpose and the station’s “overlooked era,” accepting a charged stasis in “flourishing stillness…full of spared collision.” Stakes are modest and interior, but the before/after is legible and carries conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The station is vividly embodied through sensory detail—the copper-and-tea floor, the big observation window, the fans’ breath, the ice-salted wind—and all of it is filtered through the janitor’s maintenance mindset. Environment and object-as-setting constrain choices: power failure necessitates the lantern; the roof and cold wind frame his final act; the meteors’ angle around an old boundary literally shapes the charged final image. The recurring window and lantern are not just decor but tools that change how he can attend to the sky. This is a fully lived-in, thematically resonant setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to live with hurt and obsolescence by finding meaning in attention—emerges early and is tightened by the meteor burst and blackout. Those external pressures force him into specific responses (lighting the lantern, tracing arcs on dead glass, speaking names) that deepen his relationship to the station and ghosts. The cost is largely internal—accepting a “small life” and a path of waiting and watching rather than escape—and it’s felt but understated. Because the conflict remains so inward and contemplative, escalation reads more as deepening than as sharply narrowing options, holding this just below the very top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of maintenance-as-love, attention as a form of empathy, and strength-through-vulnerability are woven through concrete acts (cleaning switches, keeping a story notebook, kneeling to listen during alarms). Recurring motifs—the lantern, the window, fingerprints, “flourishing stillness,” the boy and his mother—shift valence by the end so that “spared collision” becomes a moral and emotional repricing of non-impact and waiting. The line “I realized the purpose of my small life…” flirts with explicit thesis, but it’s grounded in the specific accumulated images, so it reads as earned insight rather than sermon. The ending invites reflection beyond the scene without collapsing into a tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The first-person voice is lyrically distinctive, fusing technical observation with almost animistic empathy (“consoles…pulse points, places where fear and wonder held hands”). Diction and imagery stay consistent with this psyche—a maintenance worker whose spirituality flows through tools and machines—as the rhythm flexes smoothly between long, meditative sentences and shorter, sharper turns at the meteor burst and blackout. There’s no POV slippage; all perceptions and metaphors feel plausibly his. The elevated language is sometimes ornate but remains character-grounded rather than sounding like an external essayist.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, emotion, and theme), rhythm varies, and metaphors are mostly fresh and coherent (“fossil pollen,” “a coil would shiver like a throat”). The density of figurative language is high but patterned and purposeful, fitting the lyric mode rather than reading as purple for its own sake. There are no obvious paraphrase loops or structural artifacts, and the closure image is clear and cleanly rendered. A slight risk is that nearly every line is metaphorical, which might exhaust some readers, but it doesn’t materially blur causality or momentum here.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The “cosmic janitor” premise and his method of empathizing with machines by correlating their squeals to meteor paths feel genuinely fresh. The fusion of industrial maintenance, ghostly memory, and cosmic boundary-respect produces a non-obvious synthesis that seems inevitable by the end. While “lonely caretaker of an obsolete facility” is a known trope, the execution—yellow lantern glass, “fossil pollen” fingerprints, flourishing stillness full of spared collisions—distills it into something distinctive. The story takes stylistic and conceptual risks that pay off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
