<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s vocation, vow, and sensitivity cohere into a vivid interior life, and their conflict between aestheticizing ruins and “mapping faithfully” gives them a real moral tension. Embodied responses—ear to lime, hopscotch to test echoes, feeling the shawl of legacy—keep emotion grounded. The final acceptance of the burden (“a shawl woven from echoes”) feels earned by what precedes. The only limitation is that internal contradiction under peak pressure could be made a shade sharper or riskier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is tight: discoveries progress from diaries → negative → hopscotch child → unsent letter → vow, each deepening the core question of how to bear the house’s legacy. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early, and the lyric drift never muddies where we are. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator accepts the promise and leaves a charged map behind while the house “rose slightly on its stilts of memory,” with the cost of ongoing responsibility and self-effacement on the page. Nothing important feels unkept or arbitrary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The drowned district, ivy-veiled passage, tidal cycles, and the house’s physical tilt create an immersive, coherent world filtered through the cartographer’s acoustic priorities. Setting is not backdrop: ivy “weather reports,” water as “landlord,” and the house lifting on “stilts of memory” all constrain the possible lives here and charge the final image. Objects like the negative, baseboard, and coals are tactile tools the narrator uses in scene, not mere symbols. The environment’s rules (climate-shifted ruins, recurrent tides) stay consistent and meaningfully shape both method and stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the narrator will truly shoulder the house’s inherited guilt/legacy rather than produce “pretty symbols”—is clear and coherently pressured by each new revelation. Escalation is quiet but present: the negative’s glimpse, the hopscotch test, and the unsent letter successively intensify what it would mean to accept or refuse the vow. Agency is expressed in attention and ritual play, then crystallized in binding the negative into the ledger and mapping “notes that sounded like forgiveness.” The one limitation is that external jeopardy remains abstract, so tension stays more contemplative than knife-edge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of legacy, guilt, climate grief, listening as citizenship, and the ethics of representation emerge organically from particulars—the diaries that never reach a secret, the house’s rehearsed quarrel, water as inescapable landlord. The recurring idea of “legacy’s burden” is dramatized through choices rather than preached, and the cartographer’s method becomes a ritual of ethical attention. The final map of “future footfalls” and “thresholds that ask questions” offers a non-literal but resonant answer: right relation to ruins is earned listening, not ownership. The piece avoids tidy moralizing while still taking a clear ethical stance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The first-person voice is distinctive, consistent, and intimately tied to the character’s profession and sensitivity, with acoustics and climate-haunted imagery shaping diction. Lyric density is controlled; metaphors like “landlord no one could evict” or “shawl woven from echoes” feel organic to this mind. POV never wobbles into information the narrator couldn’t have, and the distance stays stable while flexing for reflection and immediate sensation. The modulation from wonder to responsibility by the end is handled through voice rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: high information density, varied syntax, and almost every sentence doing double duty (world + emotion, image + theme). Figurative language is frequent but not muddled; the metaphors are coherent, context-appropriate, and rarely feel decorative. There are no noticeable paraphrase loops or template cadences, and rhythm supports the accumulative, listening-driven mode. Any hint of “purple” is countered by clarity of action and image, especially around the negative, hopscotch, and letter beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise of a “corridor echo cartographer” in a post-climate-shift drowned district mapping what walls dream is strikingly original and fully inhabited. Familiar concerns—climate change, memory, inheritance—are filtered through a genuinely fresh method (acoustic cartography, hopscotch as listening instrument, legacy as architectural guilt). The final conceptual move—maps as routes of future ethical attention rather than spatial diagrams—reweights both fantasy and cli-fi tropes. The risks in style and concept feel integrated rather than gimmicky, yielding a memorable, singular piece.</comment>
