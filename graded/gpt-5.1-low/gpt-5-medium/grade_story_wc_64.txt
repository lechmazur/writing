<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The gardener’s motives and temperament (“blithe…yet shadowed,” “tenderly organized, even in grief”) are specific and consistently dramatized through his methods and care with objects. His internal shift from almost playful curiosity to grave respect (“his blithe mask soften into respect”) is earned by what he uncovers. The piece could push his conflict a bit harder—there’s little sense of moral struggle about exposing or protecting the widow’s lie—but what’s here is coherent and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: wait for the chess clock, read the tapestry, discover the missing grave, investigate the asters, then the poplar, and reframe the burial lie. The accumulative/lyric pattern is taught early and sustained, and the closure—a reconfigured understanding of the widow’s intentions plus his choice to mark and later plant poppies—is legible with conceptual cost. Some steps (e.g., the quick leap from tapestry to two perfectly located sacks) feel a touch convenient, but they don’t break the underlying logic or stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cobalt silo, cemetery, asters, poplar, and tapestry form a striking, coherent environment whose details are filtered through the gardener’s sensibility and grief. Setting is not postcard: the silo’s metal “listening,” the earth carrying echoes, and the sovereign case as a provisional grave marker all constrain tactics and charge the final images. Sensory and atmospheric specificity is high without losing spatial clarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The central stake—uncovering the truth and “the shape of intentions” behind a missing grave—is clear and escalates from abstract listening to concrete discovery and ethical implication. The main tightening occurs when the tapestry reveals a missing grave and he chooses to disturb the asters and the earth, then to follow the map to the poplar, culminating in his decision to honor the truth with a new marker and planned poppies. Pressure is mostly contemplative rather than sharply oppositional; the cost is felt but gentle, so the conflict never quite bites as hard as it could at this level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of truth versus comforting fiction, how love and duty coexist, and how memory is inscribed (in thread, earth, and metal) emerge naturally from events and objects rather than being stated. The widow’s dual loyalty and the gardener’s final act—marking an “empty” grave to honor both absence and devotion—give a nuanced, non-moralizing answer to the initial question about intentions. Symbolic elements (tapestry, echoes, flowers, sovereign case) shift meaning at the end without feeling forced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The third-person close voice is lyrically consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (“velvet unwinding from a well-kept secret,” “tapestry hangs here like a pinned night”) that matches the gardener’s temperament. POV is stable and does not leak into omniscient commentary beyond what fits the established, gently omniscient-lyric stance. At times the diction feels slightly more ornate than strictly character-bound, but it remains coherent and controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and generally multi-functional, advancing atmosphere, character, and plot at once. Figurative language is frequent but mostly well-chosen and legible; the imagery stack rarely muddies sense or momentum. There is mild risk of over-lushness in places, yet clarity and propulsion to the discoveries and final decision remain intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The combination of a blithe cemetery gardener, a listening metal silo, a funerary tapestry that encodes a falsified burial, and echoes that migrate from air to soil feels genuinely fresh and integrated. The twist—that the “missing grave” hides a deliberate absence protecting a smuggled lover—reframes prior details in a non-obvious but earned way. The piece takes formal and imagistic risks without losing coherence, and the final repricing of absence as a kind of presence is memorable.</comment>
