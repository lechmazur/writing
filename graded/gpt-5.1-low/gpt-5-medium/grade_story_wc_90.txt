<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and particular—her pacifism, grief, and strange buoyancy all feel integrated—and her arc from brittle avoidance toward integrated compassion is clearly earned by the shadow work. The motive to open the lock is consistent and drives her choices, especially the decision to face her own "wolves." Emotional life is slightly more conceptual than embodied at times, but the contradictions (joy that must coexist with sorrow) are dramatized rather than merely stated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The accumulative structure is clear: orienting intro, approach via the tear-maps, inner calibration, then the lock test and the seed-library reveal. The closure beat—choosing to open only what can be tended and to remain as caretaker—is a resonant reconfiguration with evident cost (embraced solitude, bound duty). Causality is consistent under a textural lens, and there are no orientation gaps or late rule-changes that undercut the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship, comet-anchor, greenhouse, albums, and bulkhead-scale are vivid and always filtered through the narrator’s needs. Crucially, the environment constrains choices: gravity variation, the lock’s weight-sensitivity, star-positioning via tear-salt, and the sterile greenhouse all impact tactics and meaning. The final image of keeping the ship warm with new sprouts directly charges the prior setting work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—opening the locked dimension by achieving an emotional-weight balance—is clear and escalates through increasingly demanding inner work and a timed-feeling lock test. Pressure builds as miscalibration threatens closure ("If I floated too far...if I sank..."), and the choice to lean with "forgiving weight" instead of wrenching is a meaningful, thematically charged resolution. The stakes remain more metaphysical than visceral, which softens felt jeopardy slightly but not fatally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of compassionate pacifism, integration of shadow, and beginnings-after-apocalypse emerge organically from the particulars: kwan yin's tear, the unarmed solutions, the seed-library. Recurring motifs—tears, seeds, stitching, weight—shift meaning by the end, especially the move from "unborn futures" to "art of beginning again." A few near-aphoristic lines (“Compassion without its shadow is brittle…”) edge toward explicit statement but are anchored in concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with metaphors tuned to this consciousness (gravity, quilting, tears as maps). Distance and tense are steady, and the modulation from haunted to gently hopeful is smooth. There is no head-hopping or explanatory overreach; the narrator’s perceptions, not authorial commentary, carry the piece.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense, and purposeful, with very little scaffolding or repetition, and images such as “a bead of compassion hardened into something that could weigh” do multiple jobs at once. Figurative language is frequent but rarely muddled, and rhythm supports the contemplative pressure rather than stalling it. The sheer density of metaphor borders on excess in places, keeping this just shy of the very top band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis is strikingly original: emotional gravity as a lock mechanic, navigating by dried tear-salt, a pacifist last-human opening not a weapon but a seed-library. Each unusual element is thematically and causally integrated rather than ornamental, and the final conceptual turn—futures as “sleeping words” in a library of beginnings—reweights the entire premise. The risks in style and concept feel fully committed and coherent.</comment>
