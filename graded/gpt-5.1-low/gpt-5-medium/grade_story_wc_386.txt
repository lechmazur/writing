<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrator’s vocation, ethics, and competence are vividly particular (“I am the kind of guide who weaves truth carefully”), and their choices—diving, decoding, staging a communal revelation—track cleanly with that nature. Emotional life is more implied than directly conflicted; we see care and restraint but little on-page struggle or contradiction beyond the principled refusal to “shout.” Secondary figures are sketched efficiently through specific details (the harbor pilot’s son, Sofia’s husband) but don’t exert much individualized pressure. The ending’s quiet endurance—holding space rather than grandly accusing—feels earned and character-true.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under a largely causal lens, the chain from dreams → decoding the taps → dive → recovery of the globe → communal listening → exposure of the company is coherent and inevitability-building. The closure unit is a resonant reconfiguration: justice surfaces and the world’s moral alignment subtly shifts while the dead can rest, with clear cost in communal shame and grief. The piece teaches its mosaic/lyric pattern early and maintains orientation and stakes throughout. The only arguable softness is the off-page handling of formal consequences, but the story’s chosen scale (moral exposure, not legal process) feels fully satisfied.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The glacier shrine, black water, wreck, and candles are rendered with exceptional specificity and mood; details like “portholes I cut into the ice” and “breath makes halos” feel both concrete and thematically charged. Environment constrains tactics—ice windows, cold, depth, darkness—and the melted snow globe as object-setting becomes the narrative’s hinge and its closing image. The world’s rules remain consistent across the liminal space between dreams, shrine, and wreck. Setting is inseparable from theme and action; this story could not exist anywhere else without breaking.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stakes—truth for the drowned vs. the temptation of blunt exposure—are clear, and pressure meaningfully tightens when the narrator chooses a slow, communal unveiling over simple accusation. Escalation is more accumulative than sharp: the discovery of the globe, then the courtroom-like gathering, then confronting the company foreman all deepen rather than radically turn the conflict. The ethical trade-off (gentle blade vs. cracking the ice) is legible and gives the climax quiet moral tension. The relative lack of direct jeopardy or reversal keeps tension from reaching the highest band, but for a lyric piece the pressure holds well.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—about how the dead seek truthful remembrance, and how justice can be restorative rather than vengeful—emerges purely from image and action, not thesis statements. Recurring motifs (windows, tapping rhythms, borrowed starlight, the snow globe) all shift meaning by the end, from eerie connection to communal testimony and then rest. Lines like “exposure is a gentle blade when you want the wound to heal without infection” ride close to aphorism but remain grounded in the concrete ice-metaphor and situation. The ending image of Sofia’s husband cranking the globe to stillness offers a quietly profound, non-literal answer to the story’s questions about what “salvage” means.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The first-person voice is distinctive, with a consistent lexicon and metaphor palette tied to diving, cold, and liturgy (“borrowed starlight,” “prayers drift like plankton”). Lyric intensity is sustained without losing clarity, and the piece modulates rhythm well—long, image-dense lines easing into simpler, quieter ones at the end. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrator’s way of noticing feels unified and character-specific. The voice bears the weight of worldbuilding, plot, and theme simultaneously, which is rare at this level.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentence-level craft is strong: high information density, purposeful metaphor, and minimal redundancy, with each line typically advancing both atmosphere and narrative. The figurative language is frequent but controlled; images of ice, breath, metal, and rhythm interlock rather than compete. A few phrases verge on lushness, but they don’t obscure action or stakes, and the final paragraph’s simplicity lands cleanly. Grammar, pacing, and transitions are smooth, with no discernible scaffold or template artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of wreck-diving, ghost-mediated dreams, an ice shrine, and a communal, almost liturgical exposure of corporate negligence feels genuinely fresh and conceptually integrated. The “language of silt, steel, and memory” and evidence encoded in a snow globe’s music box transform familiar ghost-justice tropes into something singular. The choice to make justice a measured, gentle ritual rather than a dramatic confrontation is a bold risk that deepens the piece thematically. In hindsight, every early image (windows in ice, tapping dreams, borrowed light) reads as groundwork for the final reweighting.</comment>
