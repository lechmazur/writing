<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s internal contradiction between lifelong control (“years of arranging”) and her emerging practice of listening is clear, specific, and dramatized through micro-choices (tying knots, then stepping aside; keeping a ledger of what she hasn’t forced). Her emotional life is embodied in plant-focused perceptions rather than labels, and the shift to “care as subtraction” feels earned instead of epiphanic. The cost—relinquishing professional certainty and identity as an arranger—is legible but quiet. A slightly sharper on-page consequence or slip when she experiments with letting go could push this higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The accumulative structure is coherent: storm season and the river crossing set pressure, mid-story she’s forced to reconsider her tactics as storms untie her arrangements, and closure lands when she reframes her role publicly and privately. Causality is soft but consistent—weather, town need, and plant responses all push her toward releasing control. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: her vow at the trellis and the “daily practice of attention” clearly mark a before/after with conceptual cost. The primary limitation is the relative gentleness of external stakes; nothing challenges her new stance in a way that might threaten backslide on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is rich and purposeful: storm season, runoff, tin roofs, the mossy trellis, and the nursery aisles all interact with her choices and metaphors. Weather is not decorative; it prunes the town’s “certainties,” ruins arrangements, drives worried customers, and shapes plant behavior. The mossy trellis and linden leaf return at closure to charge the final vow image, making environment and object inseparable from theme. A touch more concrete spatial choreography inside the nursery during customer scenes could take this into truly exceptional territory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to tend (plants and people) under ongoing disruption—is signaled early and coherently tightened as storms undo her efforts and the town’s anxiety mounts. The meaningful turn comes when she starts keeping a ledger of what she has not forced and later articulates this stance at the community hall; she forecloses the path of command/control as her primary caregiving mode. Internal and external pressures (weather, customers, town expectations) are interwoven, though never explosive. Because the conflict remains mostly contemplative and never quite corners her into a painful live trade-off, the escalation feels strong but not searing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of control versus attention, care as subtraction, and transformation through listening emerge organically from repeated plant images and small tactical shifts (knots loosening, jasmine braiding with hop, observing drift rather than reconstructing rows). The linden leaf and trellis motifs accrue real thematic weight and reweight prior material by the end. Some thematic articulation in her speech (“I am not an authority…care can be a subtraction”) leans close to thesis-stating, slightly diminishing subtext in favor of explicit takeaway. Nonetheless, the final vow and image largely restore resonance by letting the garden “hear itself through her” without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Mara’s plant-centric sensibility—she “hears roots thinking,” describes customers’ questions as “raw as bark,” and treats weather as a slow teacher. Rhythm and syntax modulate appropriately, with more spacious, looping sentences around reflection and tighter lines around concrete shifts. Dialogue is sparse but functional and in character, especially the boy’s simple question and her oblique, sincere answer. The voice occasionally edges toward essayistic abstraction, but it remains grounded enough in image to keep the POV vivid.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, with figurative language that mostly feels fresh (“droplets clung to everything like second thoughts,” “it was not a tangle but a treaty”). Repetition of key phrases (“mossy trellis after rain,” “reconstruct,” “listening”) is purposeful rather than looped scaffolding. There is a high metaphor density, but it’s controlled and thematically aligned rather than purple or muddled. A very few abstractions (“sustaining transformation,” “old impulse to fix everything”) could be tightened into more concrete expressions to reach the very top band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise—storm-season nursery as a lab for learning to relinquish control, with quasi-animistic attention to plants’ “own calculus”—feels distinct and thoughtfully realized. The integration of botanical detail, emotional care work, and a philosophical shift in tending practice is fresh rather than gimmicky. The narrative avoids big twists, instead committing to a quiet but non-obvious revaluation of authority and reconstruction. It doesn’t quite risk a structurally daring move or a deeply unsettling cost, but as a lyrical piece it shows a clear, original vision.</comment>
