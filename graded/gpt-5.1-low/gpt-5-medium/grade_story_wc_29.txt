<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrator’s blend of skepticism, duty, and “cautiously hopeful” pragmatism is sharply drawn and stays consistent under pressure. Her motives—protecting genuine choice versus surrendering to seductive control—credibly drive every key action from rooftop investigation to subsonic counter-broadcast. Internal conflict (temptation by offers of tenure and painless nights vs. her ethic of evidence and breath) is present and resolved with a felt though quiet cost. The main slip is that the final maxim (“teach people their breath”) edges toward tidy aphorism, though it’s fairly well earned by prior beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The causal throughline is clean: strange signal → investigation → recognition of manipulation → active countering → negotiated détente and redefined role. The structure escalates coherently from studio unease to rooftop confrontation and citywide psychic shift, then into a reflective but still pressurized denouement. Closure is solid Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she refuses power’s neatness, accepts a messier, slower community, and repurposes the signal’s gift into an emergency channel, with the cost of ongoing vigilance and foregone prestige on the page. No orientation or lens-clarity issues; the hybrid causal/lyric drive is taught early and held.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The university radio station, campus, and theater roof are vividly particular and tightly filtered through a sound-obsessed professional: mixer lights as constellations, cables as throat singing, kettles hissing at dawn. Environment materially constrains options—her access to antenna arrays, subsonic frequencies, and the campus grid is what makes resistance possible. The charts-as-object function as micro-setting in the end, literally bearing the reweighted rule (“teach people their breath”) and charging the final image. Atmosphere (election-season hum, peeling posters, rain-softened posters) supports the themes of manipulation vs. unscripted community without feeling contrived.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the community’s emotional tempo will be externally orchestrated or self-owned—is clear and sharpened by the election backdrop and the dean’s pressure for “neutrality.” Escalation is steady: from eerie pattern recognition to realizing campus groups are being synchronized, to direct psychic contact with the trickster wave and its bribes, culminating in her risky subsonic “countersigns.” The price is subtle but legible: she forgoes easy power and prestige, accepts slower, messier discourse, and commits to an ongoing, unglamorous custodial role. The only limit is that physical or social peril never feels acute; tension remains primarily conceptual/ethical rather than viscerally dangerous.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of media ethics, the myth of neutrality, breath/pause as political act, and resistance to algorithmic/trickster amplification emerge organically from events rather than didactic commentary. The cosmic signal’s love of predictability and chorus neatly refracts contemporary concerns about polarization and engagement farming, while her intervention literalizes creating space for genuine choice. The closing annotation reweights the entire story as a lesson in teaching embodied attention rather than offering messages, landing a resonant answer to the implied question of how to resist manipulative power. The single-line aphorism edges close to explicit moral but is justified by the concrete struggle that precedes it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The first-person voice is confident, idiosyncratic, and acoustically minded; metaphors consistently arise from sound, astronomy, and campus life (“static had tempers; silence had accents”). POV control is tight, with no leakage beyond what this narrator could plausibly infer, even during the quasi-telepathic contact with the wave. Rhythm and diction modulate well between lyric density and clipped, wry observations (“Neutrality is a station myth, and the wave seemed to smirk”), preserving character specificity. Sparse dialogue feels natural and carries subtext, especially in the dean calls where institutional anxiety contrasts with her more grounded stance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prose is dense yet economical; nearly every sentence advances character, world, and theme simultaneously with minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is vivid but controlled—extended metaphors about sound and celestial patterns are coherent and pattern-consistent, avoiding purple excess. There are no noticeable loops, synonym churn, or structural tics; sentence variety and paragraphing sustain momentum despite the lyric mode. The final third maintains clarity and pressure, with the last few images (posters in rain, dawning quad, chart annotation) landing cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of campus radio tech, election-season polarization, and an ancient cosmic trickster operating via subsonic political entrainment feels strikingly fresh. Using rhythmic counter-signals to salt pauses into rallies and disrupt a borrowed metronome is an inventive, non-obvious tactical turn that grows logically from prior particulars. The cosmic entity’s motives and aesthetics (loving us as noise, harvesting choruses) avoid standard alien tropes and deepen the metaphor for algorithmic power. The risk of a quiet, concept-heavy piece is fully embraced and paid off in a way that feels singular rather than template-driven.</comment>
