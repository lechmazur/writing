<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and specific, with the narrator’s ethical self-reckoning (“ethics I had not yet earned”) feeling grounded in past behavior rather than abstract guilt. The decision to reconfigure the troupe’s method and invite the woman in is clearly motivated and costs ego and control. Internal contradiction—wanting to do good while having exploited others—is present, though the final serenity comes a touch smoothly, with little residue of resistance in the last beats. The woman from the bar is sharply but briefly drawn, serving as a strong ethical counterweight despite limited on-page time.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The structure is clean: argument → solitary reflection in the dome → decision to change method → arrival of the woman → joint redesign → first performance under new rules. Causality holds under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the troupe’s practice is materially altered. Some middle moves (designing and staging the new show) are summarized rather than dramatized, but the chain is legible and emotionally continuous. Cost is conceptual but real: renouncing exploitative tactics and accepting followership in place of leadership.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome, cables, moths, “meteor hush,” and ribs of scaffolding are vivid and integrated into action and theme. The acoustics and curvature justify the emphasis on listening and silence, and the ribs metaphorically echo the ethical “body” being measured for healing. The setting doesn’t heavily constrain physical options, but it clearly charges the final image of a quiet, open performance. Details feel chosen rather than touristic, with the dome’s strangeness aligning with the experimental, reflective work being attempted.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether and how they can practice “ethical storytelling” without theft—is clear early and carries through. Pressure escalates when the woman whose story was used enters and claims authority via the stick, forcing the narrator to put their new ethic into practice rather than keeping it theoretical. The cost is primarily moral and social (ceding control, exposing the troupe’s own glibness), so the tension is cerebral rather than visceral. Still, the reversal of power between performers and subjects, and the commitment to reverse any harmful scene, read as a genuine narrowing of options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of consent, power, and responsibility in storytelling emerge organically from concrete practices: the puppet shows, the story stick, and the switching of roles between audience and troupe. Subtext lives in images like strings as constellations and applause pressing others into the floor, effectively reframing familiar “satire does good” rhetoric. At times the language edges toward explicit thesis (“if we meant to explore ethical storytelling…”), but the final meteor-hush listening and refusal of applause keep the ending from feeling moralistic. The conceptual repricing of what counts as “doing good” is clear and resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The first-person voice is distinct, controlled, and plausibly urbane, with metaphors that feel like this narrator’s way of thinking rather than generic lyricism. POV remains stable and modest about what it can know, even when speaking for the troupe as “we.” Rhythm varies effectively between lush, image-dense lines and plainer ethical assertions, tightening toward the final quiet. Diction is elevated but coherent with a salon-trained calligrapher, avoiding register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is consistently strong, with most sentences doing dual work—advancing ethical stakes while enriching atmosphere (“half-lit epiphanies rose like smoke that forgot its fire”). Figurative language is frequent but rarely muddled; images extend each other (strings, ribs, constellations, current) instead of clashing. There are no obvious loops or scaffolding, and syntax has healthy variety. A few metaphors verge on density that could risk reader fatigue, but they don’t materially obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The combination of a decommissioned radar dome, a campfire story stick as prosthetic conscience, and subversive puppet shows used to interrogate ethics of representation feels genuinely fresh. The story doesn’t rely on twist or template; it commits to a non-obvious moral calculus about power and subjecthood in art. Recurring images (strings, hush, vellum, reversal) cohere into a unique conceptual system rather than decorative quirk. The choice to center consent and co-authorship in such a compressed, lyrical frame shows high-level ingenuity.</comment>
