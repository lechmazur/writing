<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrator is sharply etched: involuntarily truthful, ritual-minded, with a concrete value hierarchy (“wonder prefers careful company”). His choices—demanding the riddle, withholding the box until the “right listener” arrives—clearly arise from that core trait. Mara is sketched efficiently with profession-specific detail and clear competence. The main limitation is that his internal conflict never bites very hard; truth and wonder are aligned here, so his flaw is not truly tested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The structure is clean: a single causal arc from blackout to Mara’s arrival, to the test, ascent, calibration, and partial restoration of the city. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world restarts and the narrator recommits to his toll-keeping stance with a reweighted sense of purpose. Causality is intact and easy to follow, with no orientation debt despite the lyric style. The main weakness is the relative softness of cost—almost everything goes right, and no serious alternative path is dramatized or foreclosed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is richly specific and integral: the lightning collection tower, lacquer box, capacitors, and drone hives are all tactile and world-defining. Environmental details (“nectar dusk,” “stormfruit,” “hive-warm twilight”) are filtered through the narrator’s sensibility and echo the bee/ritual motif. The tower and box also function as tools that constrain options and drive the action at the crown. A slight risk of sensory overabundance remains, but it supports rather than stalls momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the drone hives and, by extension, the city’s ecological and civic rhythm—is clear and escalates once Mara appears and the hidden box becomes relevant. The key tightening is the choice to reveal the tray/box and climb, folding the narrator’s ritual/wonder ethic into the practical crisis. However, opposition is mostly implicit (urgency, forgetfulness, the city’s desire for “comfort of repeating”) rather than personified or sharply obstructive. As a result, tension is more conceptual than visceral, holding the piece below top-tier pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of wonder vs efficiency, ritual vs routine, and truth as both constraint and service emerge organically from action and imagery. The drones’ “forgetting” and the queen tone’s restoration mirror the human risk of losing purpose in mere functioning, nicely reweighted by the ending. Lines like “Wonder needs a ritual, even in crisis” come close to thesis-stating but remain supported by concrete beats. The final image of the narrator resuming his candid toll-keeping after renewal offers a quiet but resonant answer to the initial problem.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and internally consistent, with metaphoric language grounded in the narrator’s preoccupations (bees, nectar, ritual, towers). POV control is tight; we never slip outside his knowledge, and his diction—“apiarist of code,” “queen of calibration”—feels like a coherent personal idiom. Brief dialogue is clean, purposeful, and voice-differentiated. The only restraint on a higher score is that the register remains uniformly elevated, with little modulation under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, densely informative, and typically do double or triple duty for character, world, and theme. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and pattern-coherent, building the honey/bee/lightning lexicon rather than drifting into mush. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding, or syntactic glitches, and the closure lines land cleanly. A few metaphors (“screens brightened like petals”) are more decorative than pressurized, keeping this just shy of the very top band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a lightning collection tower, ritual toll-keeping via riddles, and drone beehive infrastructure is fresh and memorable. The “queen tone” as a calibration queen for metal bees and the idea of charging toll in wonder, not coin, reframe familiar SF and mythic motifs in a non-obvious way. Emotional truth about boredom, routine, and crisis-driven curiosity grounds the high concept. The only minor limitation is that the conflict could be riskier to match the conceptual originality.</comment>
