<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrator is sharply drawn as a failed revolutionary turned heterodox scholar, with motives (reimagine the civilization, defend a more collective past) that clearly drive their choices. Ledger, though mostly summarized, functions as a legible foil whose skepticism raises real stakes. Internal conflict—fear that they are simply projecting their “poet’s hunger” onto the past—is present but more implied than deeply dramatized in embodied moments. The emotional life trends conceptual and lyrical rather than fully felt in the body, which keeps this just short of the very top tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is tight: discovery of the shard → invention of the mirror ritual → public storm-readings → council adjudication → coda of ongoing practice and the shard’s cracking. Each phase clearly grows from the last, and the council scene reconfigures the stakes on the page with a visible before/after (the archive vote, Ledger’s muffled laughter). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: the civilization’s meaning and the function of ornament are revised at a social level. The only slight limitation is that the council’s decision is briskly summarized rather than more fully dramatized in beat-by-beat interaction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid and visible-time storms are vividly particular and integral, not backdrop: veils of years, ruptured salons, and time-squalls create both mood and mechanism. Environmental features directly constrain tactics (storms as the moments when the shard sings; mirrors that must be covered to let the song emerge) and shape the climax in the council hall. The shard, linens, and stormlight operate as charged objects in a lived-in ritual space rather than as static symbols. Description is lush yet controlled and consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The central conflict—who gets to define the vanished court, tyrants or communal artisans—is established early via Ledger’s stance versus the narrator’s, and it tightens meaningfully through petition, public readings, and the high-stakes council storm. The protagonist’s agency (devising the ritual, insisting on mirror coverings, demanding a storm in the hall) drives the major escalations. Stakes are conceptual but real: control of memory, academic authority, and the narrator’s access and credibility. The price paid skews toward emotional and ideological (revolution still failed, shard cracked) rather than materially crushing, which slightly softens the felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Thematic work is exceptionally integrated: ornament as solidarity and archive, the politics of historiography, and the tension between superstition and method all emerge from concrete actions (covering mirrors, reading the shard, the council storm) instead of abstract lecturing. Recurring motifs—mirrors versus listening, storms of time, collective making—shift resonance by the end, especially in “we made, we made, we made, until the making made us equal.” The piece resists tidy moral binaries: it concedes superstition yet vindicates its procedural value, and Ledger’s graphs are not straw-men. The final image of continued mirror-covering “not to forget but to listen” offers a nuanced, non-didactic thematic answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The first-person voice is distinctive, baroque, and confident, with metaphors and syntax that clearly belong to this specific “poetically inclined” revolutionary. Lexical and tonal choices like “ornament as ledger for debts canceled by beauty and labor” and “planets ticking like clockwork grapes” feel both character-true and world-consistent. POV is stable and controlled; even reported speech (Ledger’s mockery, council procedure) remains filtered through the narrator’s perception. High lyricism never collapses into vagueness or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The line-level craft is densely imagistic yet remarkably precise; phrases such as “the covered mirrors sighed like sleeping swans” or “planets ticking like clockwork grapes” do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, theme) without redundancy. Sentence rhythm varies well across the piece, sustaining momentum in a largely reflective, lyric narrative. Figurative language is frequent but patterned and coherent, avoiding metaphor muddle or synonym churn. A few lines verge on conceptual abstraction, but they remain anchored enough in objects and action that clarity and closure never suffer.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements—visible time, baroque asteroid archaeology, revolutionary historiography, and ritualized mirror-covering as research method—feels genuinely fresh and necessary rather than gimmicky. The story fully commits to its oddities, following through on the implications of time made visible and ornament as social archive. The council-storm performance and the repeated veiling of mirrors as a way to “listen” rather than look offer a non-obvious but inevitable-feeling turn on the premise. Emotional truth (failed revolution, fragile shard, partial victory) grounds the conceptual fireworks, elevating this beyond merely clever worldbuilding.</comment>
