<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The carver’s interiority is rich and specific—her rituals with the ribbon, her apprenticeship habits, and her inherited ethos from her mother all build a coherent, motivated self. The father and the dead mother both apply real pressure: the father’s steadying/not-crying stance and the mother’s “less a ghost than a gust” corrections force the narrator to calibrate ornament vs. silence. Contradictory impulses (devotion to craft vs. fear of breaking grief, desire to hold many names vs. not becoming stone herself) are present, though mostly in implication rather than explicitly dramatized crisis. The arc from tentative, hush-guided carving to articulating “movement… is the shape of our collective grief” reads earned and costly without tipping into sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The structure is accumulative and very controlled: nightly returns, butterfly migration, and recurring visits from the father and the spectral mother build a clear pattern. The closure—finishing the daughter’s stone with “a single spare curve” as the butterflies depart—functions as a resonant reconfiguration, reweighting the entire practice of carving as mapping collective grief. Causality in an accumulative sense is tight: apprenticeship → ribbon → father’s selection → evolving mentorship → final kite image; nothing feels arbitrary. Cost is legible in the “quilt I could not finish” and the choice to keep working under that endlessness, making the before/after of her understanding of grief and movement clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse is exquisitely realized and always functional: glass ribs, condensation “planets,” broken vents, cracked roof, and lettuce beds all shape mood and behavior. It constrains choices (a protected, ritual space where grief is processed; the hush that carries the mother; butterflies testing the roof and landing on words) rather than serving as backdrop. Environmental shifts—the storm that “tests the roof,” the migrating butterflies, the ash gold evening—track the emotional arc and the passage of time. The space charges the final image, even if the kite itself is on stone rather than in air, by having taught us to read controlled calm and fragile shelter as the condition for this work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether and how the narrator can hold others’ grief without hardening—is clear, and the arrival of the father at dusk tightens it beautifully. Escalation is quiet but real: initial solitary ritual → shared poem selection with the father → storm that threatens the sanctuary → ongoing accumulation of stones and spectral corrections → timed completion as the migration ends. The cost is primarily internal and conceptual (accepting endless work, living within grief’s movement rather than closure), which fits the mode but may feel low-pressure to readers expecting a sharper external test. Still, the father’s repeated visits and the narrator’s deliberate adjustment of her carving style under his gaze and her mother’s corrections give the climax genuine weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The thematic web—grief as movement rather than progress, names needing silence to grow, butterflies and tide as models for collective mourning—is intricate and coherent. Recurring motifs (ribbon with poems, table extended into the greenhouse, storm that doesn’t break the panes, butterflies as commas) all accrue meaning and reconfigure at the end with the “single spare curve” kite. The one overt thesis sentence (“Movement… is the shape of our collective grief”) is close to a thematic statement, but it feels earned by the prior particulars rather than imposed. The ending leaves a charged, contemplative ambiguity about cost and endurance without defaulting to moral or sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The first-person voice is assured, consistent, and distinctively meditative without drifting into abstraction. Diction (“thundering calm,” “spectral mentorship sharper than any chisel,” butterflies as an “orange river”) stays plausibly within this artisan’s lyrical but grounded sensibility. Psychic distance is well controlled: we remain close enough to feel each tap of the chisel while the narration compresses weeks and patterns in a way that suits the reflective mode. Dialogue fragments are minimal but resonant, and the father’s lines feel tonally distinct through what he chooses to say and where he stands (by the lettuce beds) rather than through heavy tagging.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prose is dense but remarkably clean: metaphors are fresh and coherent, rarely stacking to the point of blur, and almost every sentence does double duty in image and character. Rhythm varies well—long, sinuous lines about environment and craft are punctuated by shorter, declarative insights at key beats (“Grief migrates as well, I thought…”). There are no noticeable paraphrase loops or scaffolding sentences; information and feeling move forward continuously. The closure image is sharp and un-muddied, with prior motifs (kite, migration, restraint) distilled into that “single spare curve.”</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The combination of elements—a gravestone carver using poem-marked ribbon in a greenhouse, mentored by a spectral mother while butterflies migrate—is strikingly specific and feels organic, not gimmicky. Familiar topics (grief, parents and children, craft) are filtered through unusual but convincing particulars that would be hard to transplant to another setting. The idea of spectral mentorship via drafts and butterfly landings is especially inventive, giving the supernatural a quiet, functional texture. The final synthesis—collective grief as tidal, migratory movement mapped into stone—lands as both non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
