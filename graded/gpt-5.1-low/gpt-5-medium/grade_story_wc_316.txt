<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrator’s numbness, duty as “recorder and the blade,” and eventual thaw are coherent and motivated, and Neri/Rae’s contrasting traits feel specific rather than token. Interiority is vivid and embodied through images (frost, teeth static) rather than label-speak. Internal conflict—wanting to stay numb vs. being moved by the training and the jar’s responses—plays out credibly. The main limitation is that Neri and Rae remain slightly emblematic; their own blind spots and costs are more implied than dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The structure is accumulative but clear: training days, petitions, the narrator’s growing dialogue with the jar, realization about “circuit,” and the joint custody decision form a coherent progression. Causality under a textural lens holds: the practices and visions lead to the redefinition of “custody,” and the closure (Conceptual Repricing + internal shift) lands with cost for the narrator’s numbness. The piece maintains orientation in space and stakes without confusion. It does, however, lean more on lyrical build than on sharply dramatized turns, which keeps it below the very top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo, clouds “like slow rivers of breath,” bells in the sky, umber tiles, and rearranging statues create a richly particular, lived-in weird setting. The environment is not just decorative: “high air” and history rewriting charge the sense that choices here imprint reality, and the brain-on-altar plus static in their teeth directly shape perception and the final image. Details are economical but layered, with recurring elements (clouds, altar, tiles, courtyard) evolving as the conflict tightens. The only mild limitation is that the dojo rarely constrains tactics in a concrete way—it is more spiritual pressure than physical constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dual stakes—custody of the brain and the narrator’s battle with numbness—are signaled early and braid together by the end. Pressure deepens as training fuses Neri and Rae’s opposites and the narrator’s private communication with the jar reframes the test from ownership to “circuit,” culminating in the joint-custody choice that forecloses unilateral claims. Escalation is more a steady intensification of pattern and insight than a sharp reversal; conflict never quite bites as hard as it could on the page between the claimants. That softness of external friction keeps the stakes from feeling fully maximal despite the elegant resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of complementary opposites, ownership vs. relationship, and reanimating a self/lineage after void are woven tightly through dojo practice, clone-law petitions, and the narrator’s internal thaw. The realization that the test is about completing a circuit, not winning custody, reweights everything prior and gives a non-didactic answer to the central question. Recurring motifs—river, breath, history rewriting, teeth static—shift meaning at the end in a satisfying way. The single explicit line, “the test was not about guardianship but about a circuit,” edges toward essayistic clarity, but it’s supported by enough concrete experience that it still feels earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The first-person voice is distinctive, with a consistent lexicon and sensibility that filters everything through bodily-strange images (teeth, frost, river stones, bells in the sky). The lyric compression is controlled and legible; even high-concept ideas (“while history rewrites itself”) remain anchored in sensory anchors. POV is stable and confident, with no leakage or artificial exposition; the narrator’s way of noticing is a clear perceptual signature. Under peak moments the rhythm tightens without becoming opaque, meeting high-venue standards.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is dense but precise, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, and theme) without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. Metaphors are fresh and internally consistent (“a key fits a wound,” “clouds wrote and wiped the world below,” “names loosened like threads in seawater”) and rarely feel strained. Rhythm varies well across the piece, and there are no line-level artifacts that muddy causality or the closing image. The one arguable risk is sustained figurative intensity, but here it reads as intentional texture rather than purple excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of ego-death recovery, a floating dojo, legalistic clone custody over a labeled brain, and the method of complementary opposites is strikingly original and internally coherent. The idea of custody as an “alternating current” circuit that vivifies both brain and survivor reconfigures standard SF tropes in a non-obvious, emotionally grounded way. The history-rewriting frame and sensory mode of the brain’s communication (taste, teeth static, remembered river) add further freshness. It just stops shy of the most radical risk-taking in structure or conflict that would push it into truly rarefied territory.</comment>
