<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and particular—her identity as a sensory map maker, her relationship to smell, and her complicated feelings toward her mother all feel individualized and grounded in concrete perceptions. The reveal that she herself pressed REDIRECT is well-motivated and reconfigures her self-concept in a way that’s earned by prior beats (“obedient to a pattern that moved me like tide”). The moral stance at the end (neither forgiving nor blaming the child-self) preserves genuine ambiguity rather than smoothing it away. The only minor gap is that we don’t see more immediate, irrational resistance or self-deception at the moment of recognition, which could deepen her internal contradiction under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The structure is cleanly accumulative with a causal spine: return to the bay → use the shard to interrogate records → discover her childhood act across universes → reprice that knowledge into a new mapping mission. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she accepts culpability as part of her cartographic practice rather than seeking erasure, with a clear before/after in how the shard and bay function for her. Parallel universes are handled legibly as variations on a single charged moment, and the mother’s silent choice in one strand retroactively clarifies the lifelong “withheld truth.” A touch more concrete sense of consequences (bodies, losses, or specific “people who survived by accident”) would make the stakes feel less abstract and push this toward a full 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The repair bay and its sensory palette (ozone, rain, sleeping coolant, chains that are chains/snakes in other strands) are rich, specific, and consistently filtered through a scent-obsessed consciousness. Setting is not decorative: the bay itself “keeps better records than prideful silence,” the terminal and shard interface drive the key discovery, and the unlocked bay across differences in the ending image embodies the reconfigured stakes. The micro-setting of the terminal, chains, and fuel system constrains what she can know and how she can act. World rules around the spaceport and equipment are sketched economically yet feel coherent with the emotional and thematic needs of the piece.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering and bearing the truth of the failed evacuation—is signaled early and escalates as she moves from revisiting the bay to confronting the specific moment of REDIRECT. The central tightening is strong: realizing that the child in the log is herself forecloses the fantasy of external blame and forces an ethical choice between erasure and integration. Internal and external conflicts braid well: her mapping ability and inter-universe travel are both a gift and the mechanism of her original harm, so her final decision to “redirect the lost” carries visible cost without facile absolution. Some of the material consequences of the REDIRECT remain abstract (we don’t tangibly feel any single loss), which slightly softens the immediacy of the stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from action and image: responsibility for unintended harm, the ethics of knowing versus erasing, and the possibility of turning trauma into guidance rather than redemption. The shard’s evolving meaning—from souvenir of catastrophe to prism of truth to warmed tool for others—embodies a conceptual repricing of guilt and memory. The story resists moral simplification (“I do not forgive the child or blame her; I fold her into the chart”) and lets the mother’s silence hold both love and terror without explicit judgment. A slight tendency to summarize thematic insight in abstract terms (“a map that lies becomes only decoration for ruins”) keeps it just under the very top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The first-person voice is distinctive and coherent, defined by sensory mapping and rhythmic, pattern-conscious diction (“each universe agrees on smell before arguing about color”). POV distance and access are stable; even the more abstract or philosophical lines feel clearly like this narrator’s mind rather than authorial intrusion. Recurring phrases (“cyclically spontaneous,” “redirect”) are motif-driven rather than tic-driven and modulate in meaning as the story progresses. The lyric register is consistently controlled, though a few lines edge toward overt statement where image alone might have carried the same weight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is excellent: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, often doing double duty for image and thought, with very little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is dense but precise—“planetary aurora poured into cheap tempered glass,” “chain of exits becoming entries”—and rarely feels mixed or overextended. Information flow remains clear despite the lyricism; cause-and-effect and temporal shifts are easy to track, and the final cadence lands cleanly. There are a handful of slightly expository abstractions that could be rendered more concretely, but they don’t materially blunt momentum or closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of sensory cartography, parallel universes, and the ethics of redirected destiny feels fresh and memorable; this is not a template multiverse story. The insistence that smell is the first shared language across universes and her vocation as “sensory map maker” give the piece a unique conceptual and emotional texture. The child’s small, rhythm-driven choice as the fulcrum of large-scale consequence is a non-obvious but deeply human angle on cosmic SF premises. It stops just shy of the most radical risk by keeping the structure fairly conventional, but within that frame the imaginative commitment is high.</comment>
