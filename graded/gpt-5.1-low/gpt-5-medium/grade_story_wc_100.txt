<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The undertaker’s weariness, professional competence, and quiet, obstinate compassion are all clearly dramatized, and his motivation to “give rest a permanent address” coherently drives every choice. Interiority is specific and embodied through perceptions (“names feel waterlogged,” “I was never brave, only hired to look unafraid”) rather than abstract labels. Internal contradiction exists—fatigue and fear versus inadvertent stubbornness—but remains relatively subtle and archetypal rather than deeply particularized. The final stance, accepting ongoing work in the library’s service, feels earned and costs him an easier, more detached life.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The causal spine is clean: package → underwater library journey → manual and ritual → confrontation with the “mantled thing” → reconfigured signal and addresses → new stasis. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with a solid causal underpinning, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where distress signals become invitations to rest. Cost is legible in his self-binding to this new duty and in the risk of “miscall[ing] storms” with a broken lens. Orientation (who/where/what-now) is solid from the first lines, and there are no causality breaks or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is vivid, specific, and constantly functional: the mortuary, harbor, service well, glass-domed city, and the “forgotten underwater city library” all inflect choices and tactics (service well descent, using vents and plankton light, shelves as addresses). Environmental details are strongly filtered through the undertaker’s sensibility (shelves as “old divers,” water “thin as breath”), tying atmosphere to character. The recurring objects and spaces—the broken lens, domes, vents, catalog—directly shape the ritual and final image. World rules are fantastical but internally consistent and learned through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming the dead’s unending distress into a permanent, peaceful address—is clear early and threads through every beat. Pressure escalates from eerie disturbance to the concrete threat of the mantled thing testing the dome and the warning that a broken lens can “miscall storms,” adding genuine risk to his continued ritual work. The main turn is his decision to ignore the warning and keep aligning shards until the signal redefines “home,” which reads as earned and consequential. The stakes are metaphysical rather than visceral, so the conflict feels intense but meditative rather than harrowing, which slightly softens impact in a high-competition field.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of rest vs surrender, memory, and bureaucratized grief (“giving rest a permanent address”) emerge organically from actions, not lectures, and recur through concrete images like catalogs, shelf numbers, and forwarding orders. The redefinition of distress signals from SOS to “SOR, stay or rest” reweights the entire premise with a quietly powerful conceptual cost. The one more explicit line—“I realize rest is not surrender but location”—skirts on-the-nose but is supported and deepened by surrounding imagery instead of replacing it. The ending leaves a resonant sense of ethical commitment rather than a tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The first-person voice is distinctive, consistent, and closely tied to profession and worldview, with metaphors that feel native to an undertaker living by the sea (“measure days by the weight of names”). Psychic distance is stable, with lyrical compression that never loses track of physical reality. Diction and rhythm are carefully controlled, modulating from eerie to quietly resolved without jarring register shifts. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the story’s lyric mode is taught immediately and carried through closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is dense and musical, with high information load per sentence and frequent figurative language that usually pulls triple duty (advancing world, emotion, and theme simultaneously). The rhythm varies enough to avoid mechanical cadence, and there’s very little scaffolding or paraphrase; most lines earn their keep. At moments the metaphor saturation (“chased stillness,” “water slackens like a vow kept,” “routes the current honors”) edges toward purple and might, for some readers, blur rather than sharpen pressure, which keeps it just short of flawless at a top-tier standard. Nonetheless, clarity at the climax and ending remains intact, and the final images land cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a weary undertaker, a forgotten underwater library, distress signals, and the administrative idea of “permanent addresses” for the dead feels strikingly original and internally necessary. The core turn—recasting SOS into SOR and redefining lighthouses and catalogs as instruments of rest rather than return—is both conceptually fresh and emotionally grounded. The piece commits fully to its strange premise, following implications (broken lens miscalling storms, mantled stillness having “no quarrel with addresses”) without retreat into generic afterlife tropes. This is memorable, high-risk material executed with confidence and coherence.</comment>
