<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s mix of guilt, professional obsession, and “carefully reckless” temperament drives every choice from persisting with the stele to devising the promise-suite. Lio is sketched efficiently but distinctly through fear of uncontrollable awakenings and his initial “terrible courtesy.” The relationship under pressure credibly shifts from stalemate to tentative collaboration as they revise the coda. A few emotional moves are phrased in high-level abstraction (“truth harms…bruises without accompaniment”) rather than embodied contradiction, which slightly distances us from peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The structure is clean: arrive with an aim (restore trust), compose the interconnected promises, trigger Lio’s return, and reach a joint revision that reconfigures their dynamic. The salt ravine flashback is well-anchored and directly informs present stakes, clarifying why this particular apology form matters. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: they accept ongoing risk while altering how they’ll handle truth and doubt, with the archive’s “breath” and the open door image marking a clear before/after. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with consistent causal links, and cost (emotional exposure, renounced silence-as-safety) is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The extinct language archive is vivid, specific, and constantly active (“Every shelf has a throat; you learn to pitch the room as an instrument”). Environmental details are filtered through the linguist’s sensibility, so dust, shelves, Breviary, and stele all read as linguistic tools rather than generic props. The setting constrains tactics (she must use the archive’s acoustics and listening spots to deliver the apology) and directly participates in the turn when the room answers Lio’s reading. The final outside/dawn image is charged by contrast with the archive’s earlier hush, giving the environment clear influence on closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether trust and collaborative work can be restored without repeating past harm—is clear from early on and tightens as she moves from private composition to placing the pages and inviting Lio to “test the promises.” Escalation is quiet but effective: the risk level rises from internal resolve, to summoning him, to letting him voice each movement and then co-author the coda. The price is vulnerability and the abandonment of silence-as-shield, with a specific new obligation to “confess doubts aloud” and plan “rescue” for meaning. The conflict could be sharpened slightly by one more moment where refusal or backsliding feels like a live option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—truth needing accompaniment, and trust as choreography rather than monument—emerges organically from the archive’s function, the stele incident, and the design of the promises. Recurring motifs (music, vows, doors, breath) shift meaning by the end, especially in “pages stood like a door held open by joined hands” and “lamplight seemed a promise kept.” There is a rich, complex stance on vulnerability and epistemic risk without tidy moralizing. A few sentences skirt essayistic exposition (“Symphonies of truth require themes…”) which slightly blunt the otherwise scene-driven resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The first-person voice is highly controlled, with a distinctive lexicon that fits an “arcane linguist” and stays consistent from opening to close. Diction, metaphor choice, and syntax all feel like extensions of this particular mind (“a maker of risks with railings,” “memo, the cruelest dialect”) rather than generic lyricism. Dialogue is sparse but pointed, carrying subtext about shared guilt and fear without over-explaining. There is mild register convergence when Lio speaks, but it reads as two similarly trained people rather than a loss of POV control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is lush yet mostly precise, with high information density—lines routinely carry setting, character, and theme at once (e.g., “Dust motes hung like annotations, each particle a footnote to vanished grammars and failed vows”). Rhythm varies well between long lyric sentences and shorter, grounding beats, so momentum rarely stalls. Metaphorical saturation is high but coherent within the musical/linguistic frame; it does not devolve into mixed metaphors or obscured causality. A handful of lines tilt toward abstraction or slogan (“truth harms…bruises without accompaniment”) which slightly undercut the otherwise exemplary line-level control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise—an apology and trust-rebuild composed as a musical-linguistic score in an archive of extinct languages—is strikingly fresh. Integrating vows as notation, shelves with “throats,” and the idea of “symphonies of truth” yields a non-obvious synthesis where concept, setting, and emotional arc are inseparable. The salt-ravine stele and fear of awakening uncontainable language add an inventive speculative pressure that remains intimate rather than grandiose. The risks in structure and diction pay off cleanly, giving the piece a memorable identity beyond standard reconciliation narratives.</comment>
