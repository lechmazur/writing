<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrator’s motivation (“map empathy onto action”) is clear and consistently embodied in her choices: going to the mirrors instead of declaring a verdict, proposing shared watches, deciding to stay a season. Interiority is specific and textured, with concrete self-conception (“shadow-laced peacekeeper,” “patience made a method”) rather than label-speak. Internal conflict is relatively quiet—there’s tension between demanded verdict and chosen process, but little sense of genuine temptation to do otherwise, which slightly softens the felt cost. Matilde and Harun function more as articulated positions than fully individuated people, though they do exert credible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: dispute → relic/shard → trip to vintage store → mirror-mediated reconstruction → return and proposal → charged gathering and decision to stay. Structure is essentially two shards (town/mirrors and orchard assembly) that cohere under a situational/accumulative lens, and the ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she commits to an ongoing, embodied peacekeeping practice instead of a one-off verdict. Cost is legible (she binds herself to the town and to a slow, labor-intensive process), though the emotional and practical price could be more sharply dramatized on the page. All major set-ups (shard, mirrors, child’s death, floes) pay off without loose threads or retroactive rule changes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is vivid, strange, and fully integrated: “lighthouse orchard perched above shifting ice floes” with lantern pears and biting floes creates a strong atmospheric and symbolic frame. Environment is not merely decorative; the floes and proposed beacon saplings directly shape the amends-plan, and the child’s death on the ice is the core shared wound. Details are consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility, avoiding tourist listing while keeping the world’s rules legible. The final floe-splitting “like a page turning” elegantly charges the last movement, though one more concrete interaction with the physical peril in the present scene could have tightened the felt stakes further.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the orchard keepers and fishers can move from blame to a shared, enacted responsibility—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates through revelation of the child’s death, the controversial proposals, and Matilde/Harun’s pointed questions about fault and oversight. The narrator’s agency drives the key turn (offering a “wheel of tasks, not a pit” and choosing to remain), but the scene stays relatively decorous; we never see anyone come close to walking away, refusing, or making a high-cost counter-move. The stakes feel important, yet the conflict plays out more as thoughtful negotiation than as a truly knife-edge ethical test, which tempers the intensity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—peace as practice rather than verdict, guilt as compost not a flag, and “courageous anomaly” as a seed for changed norms—is deeply woven into events and images (mirrors, shard, child, beacon saplings). The story largely lets theme emerge from action and proposal rather than abstract lecturing, and the final decision to stay a season grounds the ideas in lived commitment. However, the closing sentence explicitly articulates the lesson (“practice, finally, is how peace keeps”), which edges toward didacticism and slightly flattens the prior resonance. Even so, the conceptual reweighting of anomaly, guilt, and shared watch remains rich and non-binary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The first-person voice is distinctive and confident, with controlled lyricism (“unslept prayers,” “mirrors along the wall like a quiet choir”) that feels specific to this narrator’s perception. POV distance and knowledge are consistent; we stay inside her sensibility without head-hopping, and the occasional rhetorical flourish reads like her thought pattern, not authorial intrusion. Rhythm varies well, with long sinuous sentences balanced by sharper declaratives at key turns (“I did not bring them certainty; I brought them a rehearsal for it.”). At moments the density of figurative language verges on ornate, but it remains legible and purposeful, never obscuring scene logic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple functions (world-building, theme, character), and there is minimal redundancy or scaffolding. Metaphors are fresh and coherent with the world (light, ice, fruit, mirrors), and rhythm supports mood shifts, especially around the gathering and the floe’s “page turning.” There is mild risk of over-saturation—so many images per paragraph that some could be pared for even greater punch—but clarity never breaks, and the closure image remains sharp. No noticeable mechanical errors or cadence templates undercut the prose.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The combination of elements—lighthouse orchard, ice floes, a peacekeeper using a broken crystal ball and vintage mirrors to reconstruct communal memory—is strikingly original and feels internally coherent rather than gimmicky. The idea of reconstituting a divinatory object not as prophecy but as a shared remembering of harm is a genuinely fresh angle on mediation and magic. The “courageous anomaly” concept and the composted guilt metaphor further distinguish the thematic frame from common reconciliation tropes. A trace of familiar high-lyric peacekeeping rhetoric is present in the final statements, but the overall synthesis and specific images are memorable and singular.</comment>
