<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira’s grief, refusal to leave the failed station, and nightly work with callers build a specific, credible psychology, and her attachment to the bronze foot is a sharp, character-particular detail. Her motivation to stay is both selfless (guiding others) and selfish (needing somewhere to put her own loss), giving her a live internal contradiction. The mother–daughter relationship is sketched efficiently yet feels lived-in, especially in the “apartment / hospital room / highway” sequence. A small limitation is that Mira’s internal conflict in the climax is resolved quickly, with relatively little ugly or irrational resistance on her part.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The structure is clean: hydraulics failing → Mira staying and discovering her role → pattern of calls → the inciting “wrong number” → tonight’s call from Elena and their completion of reverse migration. Causality is coherent under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens, with each detail (hydraulics stuck, midnight timing, reverse migration) paying off in the final bridge between Mira and Elena. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mira’s purpose is reinterpreted from avoidance to deliberate building within grief. The only reason this doesn’t go higher is that Elena’s final navigation back feels relatively unimpeded; the process is told smoothly rather than pressured with a concrete on-page snag.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The signal station—failed hydraulics, frozen dishes, rusted gantries, starlight—is vivid and strongly integrated, not mere backdrop: it explains why she can listen to “more than radio waves” and shapes her isolation. The micro-setting of the console and bronze censer foot is equally concrete and returns with charged significance at the end. World rules about the station “drinking in frequencies” are consistent and folded into atmosphere rather than exposed in lumps. A tiny ceiling on the score comes from the environment not quite constraining an on-page tactical choice in the climax, even though it deeply charges the imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can Mira guide her own daughter home as she has others?—is clear and emotionally strong, and the midnight call from Elena is a meaningful tightening. The reverse migration framework gives internal conflict stakes: each described place is a step either toward or away from reunion. However, the navigation itself proceeds without much resistance or cost beyond the inherent poignancy; we don’t see a concrete failed attempt, time pressure, or a contested choice that could sharpen the tension. The result is moving but a bit too frictionless at the peak for truly top-tier pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of grief as geography, staying-with-loss instead of escaping, and fragments as precious (the censer foot, the station itself) are woven through images rather than bolted on. “Reverse migration” is an elegant conceptual lens that operates both as world rule and metaphor, and it reweights earlier calls once Elena’s journey follows the same pattern. The final realization—“Not to run from grief, but to build within it”—is thematically apt but edges toward explicit statement, slightly flattening what the images already earned. The piece nevertheless leaves a resonant emotional aftertaste rooted in particulars rather than a neat moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The third-person-limited voice is consistent, with a clear perceptual signature: technical terms (hydraulics, antenna dishes) sit alongside lyrical observations in a way that feels natural for a long-time station worker. Dialogue, especially between Mira and Elena, is spare, clean, and advances both plot and subtext without over-explaining. Rhythm and syntax modulate effectively, with more spacious, image-rich sentences in reflective passages and tighter lines around the midnight calls. There are no POV slips or register jolts, and only very occasionally does the narration lean into a slightly generalized lyricism instead of Mira-specific noticing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is polished and efficient: sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without feeling overstuffed, and there is minimal scaffold or repetition. Metaphors like “the light too loud somehow” and the censer as a “foot without a body” are vivid and coherent, avoiding mixed or strained imagery. Paragraphing supports momentum; there is no obvious fat that could be cut without cost. A few lines (“raw solace,” “geography of loss”) approach abstraction, but they’re supported strongly enough by surrounding concrete images that they don’t undercut clarity or cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fusion of a derelict signal station, grief work, and the notion of “reverse migration” for the dead is an inventive reframing of afterlife contact, feeling more like a singular vision than a genre template. The bronze censer foot as a recurring, charged fragment is an especially fresh object choice that grounds the more ethereal elements. The emotional arc—using a job built around others’ grief to finally reach one’s own lost child—is familiar in outline but rendered with enough specificity to feel new. It stops short of radical risk (the navigation succeeds cleanly, without a harsher or stranger cost), which keeps it just below the highest originality band.</comment>
