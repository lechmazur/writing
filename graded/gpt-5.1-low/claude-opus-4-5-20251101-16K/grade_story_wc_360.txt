<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Vesper is sharply realized: her cryptic self-protection, lightlessness, and compulsive borrowing of personalities feel specific and embodied (“had worn his anguish like a coat”). Her motivation and methods are consistent and rooted in her history with the halo fragment. The internal conflict between having no self and living through others is present but could be dramatized more directly under pressure rather than mostly described. Lumen functions mainly as a foil, offering some relational pressure but with limited evolution of their dynamic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece reads as accumulative/textural: pressure mounts through successive star extinctions and deepened exposition of Vesper’s impossible task. Orientation (who/where/when) lands cleanly and the structure stays coherent within a single scene. Closure is a charged poise: Vesper recommits to borrowing and printing in the face of escalating cosmic forgetting, pressing the halo fragment to her heart with a visible (if quiet) cost. The change is more deepening than decisive; the stakes stay largely conceptual, which slightly blunts the sense of structural turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The topaz workshop, crystalline walls, and halo fragment create a vivid, specific environment that shapes the story’s texture and meaning. The setting is not mere backdrop: the carved topaz relic, fractured starlight, and skylight of vanishing stars all directly echo and charge Vesper’s work and the final image. World rules (halo fragment, emotional mathematics, falling celestial objects) feel internally consistent and are learned through present action. The environment could constrain physical choices more explicitly, but its atmospheric and symbolic pressure is already strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving cosmic feeling by mapping emotions—is clear, and the night’s multiple vanishing stars provide an effective, ominous external pressure. However, escalation is mostly linear accumulation (another star goes out) rather than a sharp turn that narrows Vesper’s options. Her agency at the end (deciding to continue, choosing another personality) is coherent but feels like an extension of what she was already doing, not a tested or altered tactic. The cost—eroding sense of self—is present yet never quite forced into a concrete dilemma on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of empathy as a form of mathematics, emotional transmission, and the universe’s dependence on feeling are tightly woven through the premise, Vesper’s vocation, and the vanishing stars. The notion of “transposed empathy” is both conceptual and dramatized via the letterpress pamphlets. The line “Because empathy is the only mathematics that matters” edges into explicit thesis, slightly undercutting the otherwise implicit thematic build. The ending reweights prior material by suggesting that the stars’ survival may hinge on her work, but the moral remains admirably unstated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The third-person voice has a clear, lyrical signature that fits the speculative-literary mode, with controlled syntax and a consistent, slightly elevated register. Vesper’s perception—mathematical metaphors of emotion, attention to light and facets—anchors POV without slipping into omniscient leakage. Dialogue is sparse but effective; Vesper and Lumen sound distinct in rhythm and intent, and their exchanges serve both character and exposition. Occasional explanatory sentences about the system of transposed empathy verge on authorial, yet remain within the established voice’s texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The line-level prose is polished, with strong image choice (“lucid turbulence,” “parabolic curve of loss”) and minimal redundancy; most sentences do double duty for mood and information. Metaphors remain coherent within the established light/stone/mathematics field and avoid mixed or overextended imagery. The rhythm varies well between longer lyric lines and shorter emphatic ones, sustaining momentum despite a reflective structure. A few abstractions (“the celestial mathematics were unwinding”) are high-level but anchored enough in concrete surrounding detail not to stall the flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fusion of letterpress craft, mathematical empathy, halo fragment technology, and cosmological forgetting feels genuinely fresh and specific to this story. The idea of printing transmissible emotions as equations, in a gem-carved workshop under vanishing stars, is an inventive synthesis rather than a recombination of stock tropes. The emotional risk—sacrificing one’s own identity to understand others—is thematically rich, though not quite pushed to a harrowing extreme. Structural choices remain conventional, but the conceptual frame and worldbuilding show high ingenuity.</comment>
