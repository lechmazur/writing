<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is specific and embodied—trade details, grief, and her relationship with Sava all feel lived-in, and her micro-choices (not lighting the torch, using ambient awareness, deciding to keep building rockets) emerge cleanly from those traits. The shift from going through the motions to consciously “making light anyway” is motivated and legible as an earned stance. Internal contradiction (weariness vs. compulsion to create) is present but could be sharpened under peak pressure; she moves toward acceptance a bit smoothly. Still, for this length, the emotional throughline is strong and distinctive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Structure is clear and accumulative: journey → exploration of the fortress → mosaic discovery → first rocket → committed continuation. The drive lens is primarily accumulative/textural, and the closure (her decision to go on making light as a form of resistance) lands on the page with a visible before/after. Causality is coherent—ambient awareness leads to the fountain, the mosaic note reorients her, the rag knot enables the act. The cost is emotional rather than plot-heavy but is felt: she chooses ongoing labor and vulnerability in grief instead of withdrawal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and purposeful: the Blooming Fortress and its overgrown siege works embody the transformation of war into life, tightly echoing Mira’s arc. Sensory detail (wisteria, roses, jasmine, old stone, drip of water) is selective and POV-filtered, and the starless night materially charges the fireworks’ impact. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain her physical options, but it decisively charges the final image and the thematic frame. Overall, the atmosphere feels rich, specific, and integrated rather than decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Mira will let grief and hopelessness silence her art or will continue to create—is signaled early and tightened through the mosaic’s message and her first rocket. Escalation is internal but clear: from numbed obligation to a tested, active commitment (“Mira was already building the next rocket”). The conflict never feels in doubt on a plot level, so suspense is low, but the emotional price of choosing stubborn hope over retreat is apparent. For a quiet, lyric piece, the pressure grows coherently and resolves in a credible Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of defiant, serious playfulness—making light in the face of darkness and grief—emerges organically from Sava’s character, the fortress’s decay-into-bloom, and the fireworks themselves. “Make light anyway” risks didacticism, but it is diegetic (a mosaic message) and grounds a specific, earned realization rather than a generic moral. The final lines (“Some battles were won not through conquest but through stubborn, beautiful refusal”) edge close to overt thematic statement but are supported by concrete prior action. The piece leaves a clear emotional afterimage without collapsing into sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and colored by Mira’s profession and grief; diction choices like the inventory of chemicals and tools feel character-driven rather than generic. Psychic distance is well-controlled, moving smoothly between sensory attention and reflective thought without head-hopping. A few lines lean toward generalized aphorism, but most of the prose remains grounded in her perceptions. The narrative stance feels unified and confident across the piece.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and metaphors that mostly clarify rather than blur (“wisteria…like purple waterfalls,” “roses conquered siege towers”). There are no significant loops or scaffolding sentences; almost every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. A couple of abstractions (“gravity of hopelessness,” “serious playfulness”) are more familiar than the best images, but they don’t seriously dull momentum or closure. Overall, the prose carries a polished, publication-ready rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The combination of a fireworks-maker, a blooming ruin of a fortress, and a mosaic note as posthumous instruction feels fresh, and the emotional truth of grief transmuted into art is well realized. The central metaphor of light against darkness is familiar, but here it’s personalized through specific crafts and objects (rag knot, chemical colors, mosaic). Structural choices are conventional rather than formally daring, yet the accumulative, quiet approach suits the material. It’s not boundary-pushingly original, but it is distinctly above-template and memorable.</comment>
