<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation (“to protect vulnerable voices”) is clear and consistently expressed through her choice to draw the predatory signal toward herself, which nicely marries competence with risk. Interiority is solid but somewhat generalized at points (“persistently curious by nature,” “It had always been enough”) rather than fully individualized and embodied. The daughter is mostly a single-note grief figure, functional but not deeply particularized. The final endurance choice—to keep showing up for future twilights—reads earned, but its cost could be made more specific and less abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: the special hour → client arrives with photograph → hearing aid link → interference → Mira’s protective intervention → successful, time-limited connection → quiet aftermath. The single-scene structure with light retrospective framing (“They called it incidental heroism, later”) gives a satisfying arc and a clear before/after for both Elena and Mira. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid: Mira recommits to her role underlined by the final image of preparing for the next twilight, with a legible emotional cost. The structure is conventional but tight; slight explanatory phrases (“Incidental heroism, they called it later”) feel a bit like scaffolding rather than strictly necessary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The mist-clad Atrium at twilight is vivid and tonally aligned, and the recurring mist (“reeling hush,” “mist thickened to opacity,” “The mist began to lift”) nicely tracks the arc of the encounter. The hearing aids function as micro-setting objects that constrain choices and charge the final image—Mira’s grandmother’s device on the desk at the end is particularly effective. Spatial and temporal anchors are always clear; the environment feels purposeful rather than touristic. A slightly broader sensory range beyond visual/aural (e.g., tactile, temperature) in the peak beat could deepen immersion, but what’s here is already strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—safely connecting a grieving daughter with her newly dead mother before the narrow window closes—is clearly signaled and maintained. Escalation is concentrated in the interference beat when the predatory signal attacks and Mira chooses to shield the connection; this is a credible tightening that makes her pay a personal price. Beyond that, tension progression is fairly linear and safe, with limited sense of genuine uncertainty or potential failure. The threat of what the predators could do remains abstract, which softens the felt risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Themes of listening, unseen labor, and the protection of vulnerable voices emerge organically from the tools and choices rather than overt exposition, and the idea that “she was always listening” nicely literalizes and reweights emotional neglect fears. Incidental heroism as a moral stance—acting without self-mythologizing—is well embedded in Mira’s behavior and the understated aftermath. Some lines drift toward mild sentimentality or thesis (“The curiosity that drove her offered no answers, only more questions. But that was enough.”), which slightly flattens complexity. The piece invites reflection but stops short of a truly non-obvious or unsettling revaluation of death, grief, or mediation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is steady, clear, and well matched to a quiet speculative piece, with a nice balance of technical terms and lyric phrasing (“They whispered in static, in the spaces between sounds”). POV discipline is solid; there’s no head-hopping, and the narrative distance stays consistent. Dialogue is clean and functional, though it tends toward the earnest and on-the-nose rather than carrying rich subtext. A few explanatory insertions (“Incidental heroism, they called it later…”) break the otherwise immersive immediacy slightly but not fatally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentences are generally tight, varied, and purposeful, with a good ear for rhythm and minimal redundancy; the prose carries both story and atmosphere efficiently. Figurative language is restrained and mostly apt, with “reeling hush” and “They whispered in static, in the spaces between sounds” standing out as strong. There is some low-level abstraction and cliché-adjacency in the closing reflections (“no longer poisonous,” “gift she'd never expected to receive”), but these don’t seriously blunt the closure image. No obvious loops, over-explained beats, or major register slips appear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise—a technician mediating calls from the dead via old hearing aids in a liminal atrium—is a fresh and coherent spin on afterlife-contact tropes. Using obsolete tech to access frequencies “modern equipment filtered out” is an elegant, specific twist that feels both plausible and thematically resonant. Structurally, this is a classic one-night-on-the-job story, so the arc itself is familiar, but it’s executed with enough specificity to avoid template blandness. Pushing further into the predatory entities’ nature or the institutional politics of the Atrium might yield an even more distinctive stamp, but as-is it reads confidently original.</comment>
