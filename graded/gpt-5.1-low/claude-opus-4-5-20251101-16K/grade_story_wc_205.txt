<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren’s characterization is rich and specific: failed revolutionary, grieving mother, and obsessive archaeologist whose motives (vindicating the Carvers and herself) clearly drive her choices. The contradiction between coming here “to forget” and being unable to stop interpreting grief is strong, though it could be made more dynamically conflicted in-scene rather than largely summarized. Her revolutionary past and her daughter’s death are powerful but somewhat static—less directly tested by any present-tense interpersonal pressure. The final renewal of purpose feels earned, but it costs her nothing new on the page beyond recommitting to an existing burden.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: storm approaches → protocol with mirrors → shard obsession and Council dispute → descent to the core → discovery of the vessels → report and renewed mission. Structure is straightforward two-part (surface station / core tombs) and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive plot turn, but it fits the accumulative, reflective design. The main weakness is that the central “fight” with the Council remains entirely off-stage, so the victory is conceptual rather than dramatically contested. Still, the story lands a clear before/after in Maren’s stance and in our understanding of the Carvers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and integrated: the baroque asteroid, carved spires, temporal storms, and luminous time-moss all feel specific and lived-in. World rules (visible time, mirror protocol, captured moments in crystal) are clear and consistently applied, and environment genuinely shapes behavior (mirror-covering, descent into the core, reading of time-light). The asteroid and its carved interior are not just backdrop but the literal embodiment of the Carvers’ ethos, which heavily charges the final image. A slight constraint is that the physical environment never quite corners Maren into a pressured choice; it mostly supports atmosphere and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the Carvers were spiritually profound or merely ornamental—comes through early and coheres with Maren’s need to reclaim meaning from her own losses. Escalation occurs via the approaching time storm and her decision to seek irrefutable temporal evidence in the core, but the pressure remains mostly intellectual and emotional, not perilous. The storm and mirror protocol hint at real danger that never quite materializes as a live threat to her body or mind. The ending frames a renewed long-term struggle (against the Council’s interpretation), yet we don’t see any immediate trade-off or closed path beyond her acceptance of continued isolation and resistance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of grief, memory, interpretation, and how civilizations respond to extinction are woven tightly through objects (shard, vessels), world rules (visible time), and Maren’s history. The idea of “artists of grief, architects of memory” emerges organically from the Carvers’ funerary practice and Maren’s own losses. A few lines verge on thesis-statement territory (“revolutionaries understood that truth required patience…”), but they arise credibly from her worldview rather than feeling like authorial lecturing. The final image reweights the entire story as a meditation on how we choose to make loss mean something without collapsing into a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (seeing time as moss, grief as encoded angles). The register balances scientific/academic diction with poetic turns in a way that feels true to a “poetically inclined” revolutionary-scholar. Occasional generalized abstractions (“truth required patience, persistence…”) flirt with essayistic commentary, but they mostly stay anchored in Maren’s lived experience. POV boundaries are clean, and the modulation from descriptive awe to quiet resolve at the end is smoothly handled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prose is polished: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) with minimal scaffolding, and figurative language is generally sharp (“grief encoded in angles,” “cathedral of remembrance”). Rhythm varies nicely and there are no glaring loops or template cadences; exposition is efficiently folded into scene. At times the density of abstract nouns (civilization, remembrance, beauty, truth) slightly risks a “purple” or essayistic feel, but it doesn’t obscure sense or momentum. The final paragraph in particular delivers a clean, charged cadence without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements—visible time as physical substance, an asteroid cathedral carved by a lost culture, funerary time-vessels, and a failed revolutionary turned archaeologist—is fresh and cohesive. The Carvers as “artists of grief” preserving temporal moments in crystal is a striking and non-obvious riff on both SF and archaeological tropes. The story doesn’t radically overturn genre conventions, but it commits fully to its premise and follows the implications with conceptual integrity. Emotional specificity (Maren’s daughter, the off-page purges) keeps it from feeling like a thought experiment alone.</comment>
