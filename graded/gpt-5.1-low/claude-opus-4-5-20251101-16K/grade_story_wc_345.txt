<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira’s motives (trusting the ghost, choosing communal over individual escape) are clear and consistent, and her rooftop observation is a strong micro-choice that deepens belief. However, her inner conflict—fear vs loyalty to the orchards and people—is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in scene. The ghost-botanist’s revelation is poignant but functions more as a concept than as a fully individualized character. The final beat, with Mira ringing the bell and letting the ghost go, lands emotionally but would hit harder with more textured contradiction inside Mira earlier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: daily messages → apocalyptic warning → concrete proof under the tree → communal decision → preparation → departure and ghost’s release, with a clear before/after. Closure is solidly on the page: they leave together at real cost (home, orchards, the ghost’s presence) for a risky hope. Some key beats, like the community’s fracturing and the technical work of escape, are compressed into summary rather than dramatized, slightly blunting escalation. Still, the structure is legible, efficient, and satisfies the required closure with cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and specific—floating rock arches as “bones of forgotten giants,” amber skies, orchard terraces—and more than decorative; the failing arches create the ticking clock and shape the final escape path. Details are well-filtered through purpose (cracks in the arches, the oldest apple tree as a locus of memory and farewell). The environment charges the final image as they thread the crumbling arches toward the glowing nebula. A slightly broader sensory range beyond the visual could deepen immersion further, but what’s here is strong and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the community can unite to survive planetary collapse—is clear and escalates from routine dependence on the ghost to existential crisis. The decisive tightening comes when Mira finds tangible proof (bell and note) and uses it to confront a fractured community, pivoting them from panic to coordinated action. However, most conflict among settlers and the cost of leaving the orchards is handled in summary rather than scene, muting the sense of resistance and sacrifice. The ghost’s continued messages smoothing disputes slightly softens the need for hard, contested choices on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Themes of communal responsibility, stewardship, and a thorny, cultivated hope are well-embedded in the ghost’s long-term care and the metaphor of orchards and the bell. The botanist’s unseen labor recasts haunting as caretaking, and the final image of butterflies in the nebula effectively reweights earlier motifs. However, lines like “reexamine what they knew about hope—that it could be thorny and difficult…” edge into explicit moralizing instead of trusting subtext. More reliance on image over abstraction at these moments would lift the thematic resonance into a subtler register.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled lyrical texture (“brambled hope,” “bones of forgotten giants”) that suits the fable-like SF tone. Narrative distance stays close enough to Mira to feel anchored while allowing brief, efficient exposition about the colony’s history. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the modulation from mythic to urgent is smooth. Some explanatory sentences could be slightly pared to let images carry more weight, but overall the POV and voice feel assured.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, rhythm is pleasing, and most details do double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. Figurative language is generally precise and not overstacked; phrases like “brambled hope” are memorable without tipping into purple. The middle third leans a bit on summary and exposition, but not in a way that creates loops or dulls clarity. The final paragraphs read cleanly and land their images without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The blend of hard-ish SF (orbits, star charts, nebula) with a nurturing ghost-botanist and an orchard world gives the premise a fresh flavor. The chalk-message mechanic and the butterfly bell as a colonial heirloom are particularly strong inflections on familiar “benevolent AI/ghost caretaker” tropes. The arc itself—warning, proof, exodus—is fairly conventional, and most turns are expected once the premise is clear. Still, the specific synthesis and the care-centered framing of haunting feel distinctive and thoughtfully realized.</comment>
