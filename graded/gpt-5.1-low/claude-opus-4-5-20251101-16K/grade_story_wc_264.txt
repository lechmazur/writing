<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira is specific, with a clear, idiosyncratic mix of traits: dreamless, patient, scientifically literate yet almost priestlike in her relation to the archive. Her motivation “to cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners” is both emotionally legible and dramatized when she asks the archive to “show me who's still burning without being consumed.” However, she never faces a truly pressured choice; her endurance and renunciation (of dreaming, of ordinary life) are told rather than forced into a sharp on-page dilemma. The result is strong characterization with limited in-scene contradiction or cost-testing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The structure is cleanly accumulative: one night on the train, framed by glowing dune at the start and dawn/moss at the end, with the Tokyo/well/cave shard as the central intensification. Causality is coherent—her decision to engage the archive leads directly to the multi-location “everywhere at once” sequence and to the collection of coordinates. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise: dawn, moss rumors, and the frozen chess clock reweight her ongoing vigil as a chosen, persistently costly stance. The main limitation is the mildness of the turn; the piece deepens more than it decisively changes her options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and particular: “phosphorescent flowers pushed through sand,” a sky starless for seven years, moss returning to burned mountains, and concrete glimpses of Tokyo and the Saharan green belt. World rules about the Burning and the archive’s quantum nature are consistent and embedded in perception rather than dumped. The chess clock and the glowing dune both charge the atmosphere and final image, even if they don’t tightly constrain tactical choices. Overall the world feels coherent, textured, and thematically aligned with regrowth and superposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mira’s mission to locate and preserve “sparks” of potential in a ruined world—is clear but remains largely conceptual and unopposed. The closest thing to escalation is the archive’s more intense response (“for a moment she was everywhere at once”) when she asks to see who still burns; it deepens the premise but doesn’t narrow her options or test her resolve. There is no antagonist or concrete threat to the archive on the page, so tension stays low-level and contemplative. The ending reads as an affirmed ongoing task rather than a sharpened trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from quantum superposition, burned ecology, gardening imagery, and the frozen midnight: potential versus collapse, tending futures in a world that has already mostly chosen death. The repeated motifs of glow (dune, flowers, sparks, stars) shift from lost stars to latent possibilities multiplying in the archive. Mira’s dreamlessness contrasted with her role as carrier of others’ “dreams” is a strong, underlined-but-not-preached thematic move. The piece avoids moralizing; it leaves the reader with a nuanced sense of duty, time-as-garden, and fragile hope rather than a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The third-person close voice is consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that blends scientific and lyrical registers (“lattice of crystalline memory,” “sand that remembered nothing of roots or shade”) in a way that feels intrinsic to Mira. The brief line of dialogue fits the established tone and functions as action rather than exposition. Psychic distance is well-controlled, allowing both external description and interior coloration without leaks into omniscient commentary. Overall, the voice is distinctive and controlled, supporting the “fractured lullaby” tone without slipping into abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; many sentences do double work for worldbuilding and character (“She was becoming fluent in uncertainty”). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically unified (gardening, light, memory, time), avoiding mixed metaphors or decorative clutter. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and momentum is appropriate for a lyric, accumulative piece. Line-level craft is publication-ready with no conspicuous artifacts or clunkers.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a quantum “divergent archive,” a dreamless guard chosen to avoid wavefunction contamination, and an ecologically devastated world reblooming in strange ways feels genuinely fresh. Familiar ingredients (post-apocalypse, quantum superposition, archivists of possibility) are recombined into a distinctive emotional and conceptual register. The specific linkage of wavefunctions, ecology, and caretaking—Mira as gardener of unrealized branches—gives the piece a memorable identity. Its risk is quietness rather than conventional twist, but the conceptual frame and imagery justify that choice.</comment>
