<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s vocation, method, and ethos (“to salvage something pure from the wreckage”) are clear and consistently expressed through action, and Elsa’s limited but poignant presence feels specific rather than generic-child. Mira’s careful dosing of truth under pressure is a strong, character-driven operating principle. The main limitation is that Mira’s own emotional stakes and contradictions (professional detachment vs. personal cost) stay relatively cool and underexplored, so her final choice reads principled but not deeply fraught. The father remains entirely off-page, so the relational crucible is more conceptual than dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The piece runs cleanly on a Causal lens: shrine → object → summoned ghost → inquiry → revelation → decision, with no orientation issues and a clear closure unit when Mira chooses to “tell the ice” instead of the living. The dream-investigation backstory is efficiently folded in and motivates her knowledge of the cook. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis: Mira forecloses the path of confronting the living and accepts a quieter, long-term justice. The main ceiling is that the cost of that refusal—on Mira, Elsa, or the father—is more implied than sharply felt on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The glacier shrine and “blue ice” are vivid, coherent, and tonally integrated with the ghostwork, and the candles resisting physics teach the supernatural rule-set economically. The shrine meaningfully shapes action and closure: carving into ice is Mira’s chosen method of justice, and the idea that “The glacier remembers longer than people do” charges the final image. The snow globe as a recurring object is also well-used as a micro-setting and emotional lens. It stops just short of 9+ because the environment constrains meaning more than tactical choices, and sensory range is skewed heavily visual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Elsa is to blame and how her memory will be held—is clear and escalates from uncertainty to exoneration to the question of exposure. The key tightening beat is the contrast between the father’s dreams and the survivors’ dreams, which reweights blame and forces Mira’s choice. However, conflict is relatively low-friction: Elsa is receptive, there is no strong counterpressure on Mira beyond a muted sense that the living won’t listen, and the ethical dilemma is resolved quickly. The result feels satisfying but not deeply agonizing, keeping stakes powerful in concept but gentle in execution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of memory, blame, and what constitutes “salvage” emerge organically through the wreck-diving/ghost-whispering parallel and the snow globe’s damage vs. purity. The final stance—that engraving truth into ice can be a form of justice when human grief is intractable—is resonant without overt moralizing. The story complicates blame of children and parental grief in a compressed, non-didactic way. It doesn’t quite reach the highest band because Mira’s internal struggle over whether this symbolic act is enough is not deeply interrogated, so the ambiguity is more conceptual than emotionally raw.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and colored by Mira’s vocation (“borrowed light,” “salvage something pure”), creating a distinct perceptual signature. Expository passages about dream mechanics stay within her frame of expertise and don’t break POV or register. Dialogue is clean, efficient, and carries subtext (Elsa’s hunger; the father’s accusations refracted through her). There are no significant lapses in tense, distance, or head-hopping, though the voice remains more lyrical-observational than fully embodied under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prose is polished, with strong images (“blue ice held centuries of silence,” “borrowed starlight”) and a good balance between lyricism and clarity. Sentences generally do multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and character—and momentum rarely stalls, despite one slightly expository paragraph about Mira’s investigative method. Figurative language is controlled and thematically coherent (light, ice, wreckage) without tumbling into purple excess. Minor constraint: the lushness is fairly even in pressure and repose, so rhythm could vary more sharply around the key ethical beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of wreck diving with dream-based forensic ghostwork, housed in a glacier shrine, feels fresh and fully committed, with the “cameo in strangers’ dreams” method particularly inventive. The decision to route justice through an inhuman, long-memory medium (ice) rather than a confrontation with the living gives the ending a non-obvious, specific twist. Emotional truths around scapegoated children and weaponized grief are handled with nuance, not as genre garnish. It stops short of 9+ largely because Mira’s internal cost and moral risk-taking are kept safe; the story doesn’t push its most painful implications as far as it could.</comment>
