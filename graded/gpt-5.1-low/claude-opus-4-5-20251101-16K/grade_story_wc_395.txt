<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s curiosity, loyalty to her missing mother, and competence are clearly motivated and drive every on-page choice, culminating in a believable decision to erase herself. Her emotional life is present but somewhat streamlined—there’s limited contradiction or messy ambivalence under peak pressure. Chen functions effectively as a power figure and immediate threat, but his role tilts toward archetypal villain, with little nuance. The family trait of “asking too many questions” is a neat throughline but could carry more embodied, specific cost earlier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: anomaly → investigation → Helios pattern → confrontation → decision to disappear, with closure landing as a charged new trajectory. Structure is straightforward and appropriate for the length, with backstory integrated via her work and the patch. However, Chen’s perfectly timed entrance and exposition-heavy reveal feel convenient and slightly mechanical, softening the sense of earned discovery. The cost at the end is legible but sketched rather than dramatized in situ.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The social network archive and “ghost impressions” of deleted content provide a distinctive conceptual setting that supports both plot and theme. The Helios mission, Nexus as a corporation, and the echo-space of erased data are specific enough to be memorable. Sensory and spatial grounding are relatively thin; the office and systems feel more like functional backdrops than fully inhabited environments. The patch functions well as a micro-setting object that charges the final image, but the broader world could be more tactile.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stakes—truth about Helios/her mother versus safety and complicity with Nexus—are signaled clearly and tightened by Chen’s implied threat. The main escalation (from data anomaly to corporate murder confession to Mara’s choice to vanish) tracks coherently and narrows her options. That said, much of the external conflict resolves through Chen’s monologue rather than active struggle or contested tactics, which blunts the sense of hard-won stakes. The final renunciation carries cost conceptually, but we don’t feel much immediate sacrifice on the page beyond implication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Themes of memory, erasure, institutional control over narrative, and the persistence of “deleted” things emerge organically from Mara’s work and her mother’s disappearance. The recurring numbers and the patch effectively link personal loss to systemic conspiracy. However, the last two lines (“Tomorrow, she would go looking for where deleted files go… nothing is truly erased”) state the thematic thesis quite directly, tipping into mild didacticism rather than trusting the images. Subtext around complicity, surveillance, and corporate power is present but could be more ambiguous and less neatly framed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent and suitably focused through Mara’s perceptions, with a clean, unobtrusive narrative stance. Prose texture has a few nice turns (“smile thin as a razor cut,” “echo of forgotten songs”) without overreaching. Dialogue generally reads natural and goal-driven, though Chen’s exposition veers toward the scripted and overtly informative. Overall the voice is competent and coherent, if not yet singular or surprising.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is clear, concise, and mostly free of scaffolding or redundancy; nearly every sentence advances either plot, character, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and there are few, if any, confusing syntactic moments. Figurative language is used sparingly and mostly effectively, with minimal cliché intrusion. The prose is solidly publishable but not yet operating at the kind of density and distinctiveness that would elevate it into a standout literary register.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The fusion of a social network deletion-archive with a conspiracy around a space mission and literal erasure of people is a fresh, engaging combination. The numeric motif (7-3-1-9) linking patch, posts, and coordinates gives the piece a pleasing puzzle texture. However, the corporate-coverup-and-missing-parent spine is a familiar genre chassis, and Chen’s villain monologue follows well-trodden patterns. The story feels thoughtfully constructed and specific but not yet formally or emotionally risky enough to feel truly singular.</comment>
