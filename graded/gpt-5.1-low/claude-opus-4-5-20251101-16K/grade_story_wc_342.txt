<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s artistic drive, prosopagnosia, and sense of failure are sharply drawn, and her epiphany about “feeling vs seeing” grows credibly from her history and the coin. Her actions—searching the alcove under time pressure, decoding the coin, choosing not to look back—align cleanly with those motives. The internal change (reframing her “limit” as the shape of her gift) is earned but a touch tidy, with little resistance or doubt during the realization. The absence of other on-page characters limits relational pressure, keeping the arc slightly airless.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The causal chain is clear: condemned library → mentor’s deathbed hint → search for the safe → coin and note → sensory discovery → conceptual shift → departure as the building falls. The demolition clock provides a simple but effective structural spine, and the final walk away under collapse yields a solid closure beat (Earned Stasis + Conceptual Repricing) with real cost. The transition from coin-touch to sweeping life-insight is a bit compressed, but not incoherent. Overall the single-scene structure is clean, with no orientation issues or dangling setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tree-trunk library is vivid and specific (bark-lined walls, hollowed oak, scholar’s guild), and its imminent destruction constrains time and charges nearly every image. Environmental details—dust sifting, rumble, “patient giants” of machinery—are integrated into action and emotion rather than tacked on. The library’s fall explicitly reweights the meaning of knowledge, constraint, and what Mira salvages, so setting directly charges the final image. A minor limitation is that the outside world beyond the demolition remains fairly sketchy, though that focus suits the story’s scope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stakes—salvaging Vane’s secret before the library falls and solving her artistic “soul” problem—are clear early. Pressure escalates via the ticking demolition and the discovery that the safe holds only a coin and cryptic note, forcing her into a new mode of perception rather than a neat technical fix. The cost of leaving as the library collapses behind her is felt, but the external conflict never moves beyond retrieval under a mild time crunch, with no real reversals or hard tradeoffs. The internal conflict resolves smoothly once she grasps the coin’s lesson, reducing friction at the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme—constraints as the enabling shape of a gift, seeing vs feeling, infinity inside limits—emerges organically from Mira’s condition, Vane’s legacy, the coin, and the doomed library. The final image (carrying “infinity in her pocket,” walking toward faces to be “touched rather than seen”) does real thematic work. However, several lines voice the thesis too directly (“The limit was the doorway. It always had been.”; “You first had to accept the walls.”) tipping into aphorism rather than letting images and actions carry the insight. The result is resonant but a bit over-explained for top-tier literary work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The close third-person voice has a distinct texture—concern with surfaces, geometry, “fractally precise” detail—that feels specific to Mira’s way of perceiving. Diction is lyrically elevated but consistent, and the narrative keeps a stable, appropriate distance while modulating rhythm at key beats (coin discovery, demolition onset, final walk). There’s no head-hopping or register drift, and the absence of dialogue suits the solitary, interior crisis. A few aphoristic statements slightly flatten the otherwise character-colored voice but do not undermine control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is lean yet rich, with most sentences doing multiple jobs—advancing plot, deepening character, and reinforcing motifs. Rhythm varies well between longer, reflective sentences and short, impactful lines (“She did not look back.”), which gives the ending real cadence. Figurative language is largely clean and grounded; repetition of key phrases (“fractally precise,” “mirror the sky inside walls”) reads intentional rather than looped. The main limitation is occasional thematic telling that feels more like essay than scene, but it doesn’t significantly drag momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The combination of a face-blind portraitist, a living tree library on the verge of demolition, and a fractal coin encoding a philosophy of art is striking and memorable. The reframing of limitation as the literal structure of infinity (sky inside walls, souls felt by touch) feels like a non-obvious but inevitable synthesis given the pieces. Prosopagnosia is used thoughtfully, not as a gimmick; it genuinely shapes the thematic and narrative core. While not formally radical, the conceptual integration would stand out in a competitive literary market.</comment>
