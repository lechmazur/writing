<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation (inherited obsession + genuine curiosity) is clear and consistent, and the line “Legacy's burden kept her rooted” crisply ties her key non-flight choice to character. Her sensitivity and unease are embodied through tactile perception rather than labels. The internal conflict between dread and compulsion is present but could be sharpened at the climactic moment (she never quite tests escape before being caught). The final endurance—being absorbed into the building’s dreaming—is earned and carries a visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal spine is clean: arrival → discovery of burned diaries/negative → revelation of grandmother’s experiments → confirmation the walls are alive → Mira’s question → building’s answer and physical claim. Structure fits a single escalating scene, and closure is a decisive change from observer to prisoner/listener. The cost—her loss of freedom/individual future—is clear on the page. No orientation or lens-clarity issues; the Hybrid (causal + textural) drive holds through the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled, post-collapse research facility is vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Mira’s acoustic and tactile focus. Setting is not just decorative: the climate-shift overgrowth and ivy ultimately act on her, and the building’s physical fabric channels its “voice” and dreams. The final image—ivy tightening around her ankle as she’s drawn into the building’s memory—charges environment as an active constraint. World details feel economical and integrated rather than touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mira’s safety and psychic autonomy versus the building’s hunger for a listener—is legible early and tightens as she uncovers her grandmother’s fate. The key escalation beats (diaries’ revelations, the film negative’s warning, the building’s groan) progressively narrow her options. Her active choice to ask “What do you dream about?” credibly triggers the final irreversible reversal where escape is foreclosed. Stakes could be sharpened slightly by dramatizing a more explicit moment of almost-withdrawal before she commits to listening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges strongly from particulars: inherited obsession, architectures as grieving entities, and the danger of seeking intimacy with what remembers too much. The concept of “what walls dream about” is reweighted at the end from whimsical curiosity to a predatory loneliness that wants to end its solitude by consuming her. Lines like “Some legacies weren't meant to be carried” veer a bit toward explicit thesis, slightly dulling the subtextual power built by images. Overall, the piece leaves a clear, lingering conceptual and emotional aftertaste about memory, mourning, and unwanted inheritance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, with a calm, slightly eerie lyricism that suits both Mira’s profession and the premise. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and sensory focus (vibration, sound, texture) feels like a specific perceptual signature rather than generic fantasy prose. There is no POV leakage or unjustified omniscience; everything passes through Mira’s way of noticing. The voice modulates appropriately into tighter, more charged phrasing as the building begins to “speak.”</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, and description generally does multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character). The metaphors (walls dreaming, nature’s “slow revenge”) are coherent and sustained without slipping into purple or mixed imagery. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; momentum is maintained even through reflective segments about the grandmother. A touch of overt thematic phrasing aside, the prose stays precise and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise—a “corridor echo cartographer” decoding buildings’ acoustic memories and dreams, in a post-climate-shift ruin where ivy and walls act as sentient mourners—is markedly fresh. The integration of legacy, environmental reclamation, and sentient architecture avoids genre cliché and feels conceptually unified. The escalation from whimsical metaphysics to horror (the walls’ lonely hunger, the ivy’s physical intervention) is an inventive reweighting of the central idea. A slightly deeper or stranger final turn of implication could push this into truly exceptional territory, but as is it’s distinctive and memorable.</comment>
