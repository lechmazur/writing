<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s vocation, temperament, and motive (“salvage something pure,” “ghosts prefer threads to nets”) are vivid and consistent, and her micro-choices—coming to the shrine, placing the globe, promising to carry Leda’s name—track cleanly. Interiority is specific and embodied through sensory metaphor rather than labels. The relationship with the girl’s ghost acquires texture quickly and shifts from investigative to custodial in a believable way. The only thing keeping this short of the very top band is that her internal conflict (truth vs. erasure vs. self-salvage) is more implied than dramatized through real hesitation or mistake.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The accumulative structure is clear: dreams → wreck → shrine ritual → recovered name → vowed exposure, with each step causally or conceptually linked. Orientation (who/where/what) is anchored almost immediately, and the wreck/shrine backstory is woven without derailing the present scene. Closure is strong: the decisive change is her commitment to carry Leda’s name and expose the lie, reconfiguring her work from private salvage to public act, with a clear before/after. The cost is conceptual/emotional rather than logistical, but it is legible in the charged final image of stepping into the night with only “borrowed starlight and a name.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The glacier shrine and the wreck beneath it are superbly realized, with ice, candles, blue slabs, and “windows” that literally and metaphorically frame the action. Environment actively shapes meaning: the ice’s listening quiet, the thinning to windows, and the candles’ smoke becoming frozen requests all charge the ritual and the final walk back through the passage. The snow globe functions as a micro-setting object that anchors the girl’s fate and the ending’s image of direction rather than proof. This category is just shy of the very top only because the setting constrains mood and ritual more than concrete tactical options.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stakes—saving Leda from erasure and exposing institutional negligence—are clear and organically tied to the narrator’s vocation. Pressure deepens when the girl appears, when the snow globe reveals her name, and when the narrator chooses a public-facing promise over private communion. Escalation here is primarily conceptual and emotional rather than oppositional; there is no antagonist on the page or hard external obstacle, which keeps the sense of cost somewhat abstract. Still, the internal conflict between mere witnessing and risking action is resolved with an earned, higher-stakes commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Memory versus erasure, truth as raft, and names as what “cross water better than bodies” are developed through concrete images (wreck, globe, windows, ledgers) rather than overt moralizing. The recurrence of “windows of connection,” borrowed starlight, and buoy/candle imagery builds a coherent meditation on how the dead persist through the living’s attention and action. The final move—from private ritual to a vow to confront ledgers—reweights everything before it without stating a thesis. A few explicit lines (“truth is a raft”) flirt with on-the-nose aphorism, but they’re grounded in the scene enough to avoid sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The first-person voice is distinctive, confident, and sustained, with patterned but controlled lyricism (“I am a wreck-diver ghost whisperer, and I was called here”). Diction and metaphor remain consistent with the narrator’s sensibility, and psychic distance stays stable even as the piece moves through reflection and present action. There is no head-hopping; the girl’s presence is rendered through the narrator’s perceptions and embodied sensations (“a bruise under my tongue”). The only limit on an even higher score is that the lyric register is very high throughout, with minimal modulation, which slightly narrows expressive range.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is excellent: sentences carry multiple layers of work (setting, emotion, theme) and the rhythm varies enough to keep the lyricism from turning to mush. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent and fresh; metaphors like “candles bruise the blue with honey” and “the vessel sleeps under the glacier now, a burned ribcage in a blue cathedral” sharpen rather than blur. There is little to no scaffold or redundant paraphrasing, and syntax is clear despite the imagery. The only caution is that nearly every line is figurative, which risks saturation; a touch more plainness in key beats could heighten contrast.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise—a wreck-diver medium using strangers’ dreams as investigative windows, in an ice-shrine above a burned ship—feels genuinely fresh. The integration of bureaucratic corruption, ritualized grief, and metaphors of starlight, glass, and names produces a specific, memorable synthesis rather than genre pastiche. The choice to treat dreams and “windows of connection” as both method and theme is particularly inventive and well followed through. It stops just short of the very top band because the external arc (exposing the owner’s lie) remains largely implied rather than uniquely dramatized here.</comment>
