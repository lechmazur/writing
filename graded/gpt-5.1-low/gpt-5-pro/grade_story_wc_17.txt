<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s motives—honoring the family craft while questioning its ethics—are clear and sharpen across the story, culminating in the choice to “rechart the echo” into mercy. Interiority is specific and sensorial rather than labeled, and the conflict between reverence for legacy and refusal to perpetuate harm is credibly dramatized. The final stance shift (legacy as “listening, not law”) is well earned by the earlier discoveries about the grandmother and the trapped man. A slightly deeper, more bodily registration of guilt or ambivalence at the core revelation could push this even higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Structure is clean: arrival → discovery of grandmother’s diaries → activation of the film negative/humming method → hidden corridor → revelation of the drowned man → ethical recharting and exit, with a clear before/after. Causality is strong under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens, with each discovery logically enabling the next layer of access. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the protagonist’s relationship to legacy, the museum, and the echoes changes with visible conceptual cost. The only slight limitation is that external stakes remain relatively contained to this one corridor rather than widening or complicating structurally.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The drowned museum, ivy-veiled passage, tiles “etched like topographies,” and fireplace of half-burned pages are vivid, integral, and consistently filtered through the echo-cartographer’s sensibility. Setting and recurring objects (film negative, ivy, tiles) actively shape what’s possible—how the walls can be read, which corridors can open, how history survives—and they charge the final images of the ivy “full of the museum’s new map.” World rules about echoes, walls, and climate-altered architecture are learned through action rather than exposition. Environment, tool, and object-as-setting all constrain or enable choices, satisfying the high-band gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to bear legacy’s burden in the face of past harm—is signaled early and tightened when the narrator discovers the man her grandmother let drown. Pressure escalates from curiosity to confrontation with an inherited cruelty, and the protagonist’s decision to rechart the echo into a lull is a clear, agency-driven turn. The cost is conceptual and ethical rather than visibly consequential in the outer world, which keeps the conflict intimate but slightly softens its bite. A sharper sense of what the narrator risks (losing fidelity to the family canon, destabilizing the museum’s memory) would intensify stakes further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of legacy, memory, and an ethics of listening are rich and organically tied to the premise: echo maps as custodians of grief, walls that “dream in montage,” and an heir who chooses mercy over strict archival fidelity. The grandmother’s choice and the reconfigured echo embody a nuanced argument about what histories we preserve or release. However, several late lines—“Legacy's burden felt lighter when I carried it as listening, not law” and “After the climate shifts, maps must learn to comfort as they guide”—tilt into near-thesis, edging toward explicit moralizing. The piece would be stronger if those insights were left more in image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The first-person voice has a distinctive, consistent texture—lyric, metaphorically inventive, and clearly shaped by someone who thinks in acoustics and architecture (“soft choreography that sound remembers,” “walls dream in montage”). Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing both close sensory impressions and reflective re-framings without slipping POV. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (more compressed around the ethical reveal, more expansive in exploratory passages) while staying coherent. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrator’s perceptual signature is memorable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, densely meaningful, and mostly do multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, theme) without redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent; images like “footsteps bloomed where nothing moved” and “half-burned pages slumped like wilted fins” are fresh and legible. There’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and rhythm carries momentum even in reflective moments. A few lines verge on saturation of abstraction (e.g., “city of memory under the glaze”), but they do not blur causality or dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The concept of a “corridor echo cartographer” in a climate-altered, semi-sentient museum is strikingly original, and the use of a film negative and humming to soften walls into speech feels fresh and internally coherent. The synthesis of climate grief, archival ethics, and acoustic mapping is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight once the grandmother’s choice is revealed. The story takes real aesthetic and conceptual risks with its lyric mode and premise, and they largely pay off in a distinctive artistic stance. Emotional truth—about inherited guilt and gentler forms of stewardship—grounds the strangeness.</comment>
