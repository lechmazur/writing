<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrator’s vocation, history, and relationship with Rowan are sharply etched through concrete tasks and talismanic objects (the censer foot, the patched coat). Motivation—to guide people through “the geography of loss”—is consistently dramatized in the work with callers, not just stated. Internal conflict is quieter but present in choices like not asking if the house still stands, emphasizing duty over personal craving. A slightly deeper flash of self-contradiction under peak pressure could push this toward absolute top tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The structure is cleanly accumulative: hydraulics fail → improvised repair → real-time guidance of Rowan’s convoy → arrival and emotional coda. Causality is firm even in a lyric mode, with the broken dish and censer rig explicitly motivating tactics. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise when the narrator chooses to send one last bearing, prioritize Rowan’s grief over factual updates, and finally rest. The before/after—helpless dish vs. narrator as “missing motor,” and isolation vs. a station “filled with raw solace”—is legible and paid for on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vivid, strange, and fully integrated: signal station, frozen dish, rusting tramline, drowned orchard, and harbor-ribcage are all seen through the navigator’s functional, grief-sensitized eye. Environmental conditions (moon phase, floodplains, sinkholes, shells) directly shape tactics and route choices. The censer foot functions as a micro-setting tool that constrains action and charges the final image of sleep. World rules about signal behavior and landscape are consistent enough to feel lived-in despite their surreal tilt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—getting Rowan’s convoy safely “home” while bearing the emotional load of their losses—is clear early and tightens naturally after the hydraulics fail. Escalation comes through the physical demand of becoming the “missing motor,” the delicate timing with moon/static, and the convoy’s progress past specific hazards (drowned orchard, sinkholes, harbor). The cost is visible in bodily strain and in the narrator’s refusal to ask about the house, prioritizing others’ grief over personal closure. The conflict is primarily situational and internal rather than adversarial, but it maintains real pressure throughout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of loss, homecoming, and memory-as-cartography arise organically from actions—reverse migration, naming stars, marking earth with pebbles—rather than any overt thesis. The censer, the house, and the reimagined sky all recur with shifting weight to interrogate what it means to guide others while one’s own losses remain unresolved. The final choice to ask if grief can breathe, not if the house still stands, reweights the entire piece’s concern from place to emotional survivability. Ambiguity about the city’s fate and the exact physics of this world deepens rather than confuses the thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The first-person voice is confident, specific, and consistently colored by the character’s occupation and grief (“my maps are scraps of other people, and my coat is sewn from promises”). Lyricism is controlled, with syntax and rhythm modulating between long, image-rich sentences and shorter, declarative pivots at moments of tactical action. POV boundaries are clean—Rowan’s perspective only arrives mediated through calls—and the narrator’s perceptual biases (toward signals, stars, and relics) never blur. The idiom feels unified and character-grounded rather than generically “poetic.”</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The line-level work is dense but precise: metaphors are fresh, coherent, and seldom piled to the point of opacity. Sentences do multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, emotion, and action in “I thread the censer foot on a rod, lash rope to a tide wheel, and lean my weight into the arc”). There’s no meaningful synonym-churn or scaffold; each line introduces a new angle or pressure. The only arguable risk is sustained figurative richness, but it remains legible and aligned with the character’s mind under stress.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements—a post-collapse signal operator guiding “reverse migration” by moon-sensitive static and a censer foot rigging a frozen dish—is strikingly original. Familiar tropes (navigator, flood, lost city) are reimagined through highly specific, personal inflections like the house’s unburned cloves and the convoy children’s star-myth. The emotional logic of grief-as-geography and maps-made-of-people feels both fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Structural and stylistic risks (lyric accumulation, surreal tech) heighten the piece’s distinctiveness without sacrificing clarity or closure.</comment>
