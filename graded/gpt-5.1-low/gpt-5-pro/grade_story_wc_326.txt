<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s motivation—to reclaim their miswritten life and extract “wisdom from failure”—is specific, felt, and consistently drives choices from climbing back up the mountain to accepting the ghost’s request. Interiority is rich and embodied (“I count my heartbeats constantly so the fear has numbers, not teeth”) with a clear contradiction between terror and a stubborn, almost reverent persistence. The relationship with the digital ghost has nuance (it both haunts and helps, wants to be remembered as more than interference) and shapes the final plan. The only minor limit is that their flaw set (beyond trauma and fear) isn’t tested against any truly opposing desire on the page, keeping the arc just shy of fully knotted complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The accumulative structure is clean: present-tense return to the observatory, then deepening via the misfiled death and near-freezing, then the ink-reading that reveals a new “corridor” and a resolved plan to descend and confront the clerks. Causality operates through emotional and conceptual turns rather than external plot, but each step is a clear “because/therefore” (ghost speaks → ink patterns → remembered corridor → decision to carry the map and shard down). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator gains a new way to breathe and walk, a concrete mission, and a reframed relationship to both the place and the error. Cost is legible in the acceptance of continued vulnerability (descending with only “weatherproof wisdom” and a shard) rather than any neat fix.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The observatory and mountain environment are vivid, specific, and thoroughly integrated, from the “opal observatory under snow” to the heaters choking and icicles trembling at the dome’s whale-note. Weather and architecture constrain history and choice: the cold nearly killed them, the trek for wood is the original mistake, and the descent corridor is literally spatial wisdom derived from that terrain. Micro-setting objects (scope, dome ribs, drains, mug, shard) evolve with the action and charge the final image of walking a corridor traced by glass and ink. The only small limitation is that the mountain’s physical danger at the end is more implied than actively pressing in the moment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to live after being prematurely declared dead, and whether failure can be reworked into a survivable path—is clear early and coherently developed. Pressure tightens through the recollection of the death certificate night, the collaborative reading of the ink, and the ghost’s request that the narrator confront those who “wrote my ending.” Escalation is primarily internal and thematic, culminating in the decision to leave by the newly understood corridor and seek a “wiser ending,” which earns the quiet resolution. Still, the on-page sense of risk in the present (they might not make it down, might be rejected) remains atmospheric rather than sharply dramatized, keeping tension strong but not searing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions: error, survival, and turning “ruin” into navigable wisdom are dramatized through the death certificate, the ink maps, and the corridor of air. The final goal—changing “the word signed to me” without revenge—reconfigures the premise from pure survival to an ethics of remembrance and responsibility. Recurring motifs (heartbeats, ink-rivers, corridors, weather) deepen rather than decorate, culminating in “weatherproof wisdom that does not forget,” which feels earned by the specifics of the mountain and the ghost. A few phrases flirt with overt statement, but they ride just this side of moralizing because they are anchored in concrete prior struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The first-person voice is lyrically consistent and character-specific, with a controlled rhythm of long, image-rich lines that still track cleanly. Diction like “map I can read,” “corridor in my lungs,” and “shadow stitched from clerks” feels cohesive to a reflective, scientifically adjacent mind under extreme duress. The ghost’s presence is filtered through this same voice, maintaining a stable psychic distance and avoiding head-hopping. There is occasional risk of the lyric register outpacing plausible in-the-moment thought, but the piece establishes an intentionally heightened, contemplative mode early enough that it reads as an earned aesthetic choice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The line-level work is dense and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double or triple duty in atmosphere, character, and concept (“The file says deceased, but the breath fogging tonight's eyepiece says otherwise”). Syntax varies and the rhythm supports the meditative, accumulative drive without major scaffolding or redundancy. However, figurative language appears in nearly every line, occasionally risking saturation and slight blur (“a mug…shatters on the star chart like fragile weather” plus several similar similes in quick succession). This high-density metaphor field is mostly coherent but just crowded enough to slightly dull the sharpness of a few key beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The combination of a death-certificate error survivor, a digital ghost of an observatory, and divination through spilled ink to find a windless “corridor” feels strikingly specific and non-derivative. The emotional problem—how to live with having been officially dead and nearly actually dead—is approached through an unusual mix of cosmic, bureaucratic, and bodily imagery. The final configuration, where breath itself becomes a navigational corridor and bureaucratic correction a moral act rather than vengeance, feels both unexpected and inevitable from the established motifs. Its only small limit is that the ghost-as-station and ink-as-interface flirt with familiar speculative textures, even as their deployment here is notably fresh.</comment>
