<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kana’s interiority is specific and textured—“ego death survivor,” “my balance finally stopped arguing,” and the fear of “snowblind calm” make her feel particular rather than generic. The central choice to vivify the brain and risk the return of feeling is well motivated by her vow to defeat numbness and the social pressure of the clones watching. Contradictory impulses (terror of blankness vs. responsibility to decide) coexist in the key moment at the jar. Secondary characters are sketched but functionally sharp, especially Ori as a moral/temperamental foil, though they don’t deepen much beyond their functions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The piece follows a clear accumulative arc: the scheduled hearing → the jar as witness → the demand to vivify → the brain’s testimony → the kata → the verdict and internal shift. Causality is clean within its lyric frame: Kana’s act enables the brain’s revelation, which reframes ownership, prompting the communal kata that crystallizes the verdict. Closure is strong: Kana’s numbness “cracked” and her new role as “door on both hinges” marks a decisive before/after with cost. The only limit at this level is that some high-concept moves (e.g., legal mechanics of the verdict) stay impressionistic rather than sharply tested in concrete obstacles.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo, neighboring rocks, chimes, clouds-as-courts, and “edge of the sky” are vivid and consistently filtered through Kana’s sensibility. Setting constrains choices and charges stakes: holding proceedings on a sky-edge dojo, “urgent air rights,” and clones on separate rocks embody contested ownership and precarious identity. The brain in a jar as a spatial center and the dojo drifting lower at the end give the environment direct thematic and structural weight. This is top-tier atmosphere and specificity, only shy of perfection because some world rules (e.g., “air rights”) are gestured at more than dramatized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dominant stakes—legal/ontological custody of the clones and Kana’s battle with emotional numbness—are signaled early and braided effectively. Pressure tightens when Kana is explicitly tasked to vivify the witness despite her fear, making her internal conflict inseparable from the external hearing. The cost is legible: she risks the return of pain and responsibility, and the resolution forecloses the path of dissociated safety. What keeps this just below elite is that institutional opposition (city advocates, formal legal consequence) recedes somewhat quickly once the kata begins, muting the sense of an adversarial test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of self-ownership, identity as process (“seed… direction”), communal guardianship, and the necessity of feeling are tightly woven into specific images and actions rather than abstract preaching. The complementary-opposites motif, the seed/forest metaphor, and “law without breath becomes a shrine to absence” together yield a complex, non-didactic answer to who owns a cloned life. The final movement—numbness cracking under entrusted weight, shared guardianship, history rewriting itself—reweights all prior material with a resonant, hopeful but costly vision of interdependence. A few aphoristic lines sit right on the line of over-articulation but remain earned by the scene work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The first-person voice is distinctive, confident, and consistently lyric without slipping into generic abstraction; phrases like “my balance finally stopped arguing” and “numbness was the quiet court” exemplify a strong perceptual signature. The narrator’s knowledge and stance feel plausible for someone post–ego death in a surreal legal-mystic world, and psychic distance is controlled despite compression. Rhythmic control is high: sentence lengths and images modulate with emotional peaks (especially around the jar and the verdict). The only minor restraint is that the narrator’s diction and the sensei’s world-philosophy occasionally blur into a shared idiom, slightly flattening distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The line-level craft is dense and musical, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, emotion) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is abundant but internally coherent and motive-driven, with extended metaphors (courts, seeds, opposites) developed rather than stacked haphazardly. Momentum holds across the piece; no paragraph reads as expendable, and the closure image (“chimes kept time with a human beat”) lands cleanly. At times the sustained metaphorical richness slightly risks saturation, but it never seriously obscures cause/effect or emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a floating rock dojo, clone custody law, ego-death recovery, and ritualized complementary opposites feels genuinely fresh rather than quirky for its own sake. The brain-in-a-jar witness, seed/forest ownership argument, and “guardians of each other” solution give the core concept non-obvious, grounded turns. The story commits fully to its surreal legal-spiritual premise and follows through to a reconfigured moral calculus about identity and responsibility. It stops just short of the very top band because a few key notions (e.g., history rewriting itself) function more as evocative frame than fully exploited structural pressure.</comment>
