<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s interiority is rich and specific—“my heart is a coastline rewritten by storms”—and their motive (to map the “geography of healing”) coherently drives choices from accepting the work to deciding to stay. Mira is sketched with a few precise, affecting details (husband’s wave “without color,” the scar that catches rain) and she exerts real emotional pressure. Contradictory impulses—leaving vs. staying, witnessing vs. disappearing into others’ stories—are dramatized rather than merely stated. The final endurance choice (staying as the ships are gone) feels earned and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The accumulative structure is clear and coherent: the narrator’s commission, Mira’s request, the first projection, the letter, and the planting all build toward a quiet but decisive reconfiguration. Causality in the lyric sense holds: each new obituary and encounter is a “therefore” that deepens the central project rather than a mere “and then.” Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: staying becomes a new mode of travel and absence is conceptually repriced into something “intimate with mercy.” No orientation debt; the frame (garden after evacuation) stays legible throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is exceptionally vivid and consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility (gulls “like hinges,” leaves “scissor down, bronze on slate”). The shadowed garden, the harbor, and the ship’s galley are economical but textured, and sensory details are purposeful rather than touristic. Crucially, the garden and the palace thread are not just décor: they constrain and charge choices (staying where “there will be no ship tomorrow,” planting seeds there, stringing the thread between rose canes). The final image of the map stitched in that same garden clearly meets the 9+ gate by having environment and recurring object charge the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to live with absence and whether to remain or keep “leaving without leaving”—is established early and tightened via Mira’s urgent request to pre-mourn her husband. Pressure deepens as the narrator commits to projecting presence, then confronts the cost of their vocation by writing their own living obituary and facing the lack of ships. The letter and the decision to stay while still “carrying their stories across horizons” form a credible escalation and earned stance. Conflict is largely internal and situational, but it remains coherent and culminates in a costly renunciation of literal departure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of grief, explained absence, and healing as migration are woven through images and actions (registry under “Compassion,” seeds sent instead of return, green shoots as “handwriting”). The line “I learn that healing is not a return, but a migration…” flirts with didactic explicitness but is supported by enough concrete experience to avoid feeling like a grafted thesis. The ending reweights earlier material: staying becomes an active, ethical practice, and absence is reconfigured as something that can “grow intimate with mercy.” Ambiguity is maintained around certainty vs. “intimating,” allowing for lingering reflection rather than a neat moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (objects imbued with memory: “bread remembers the heat that birthed it”). Lyric compression and patterned metaphor are taught from the first line and sustained without head-hopping or register slips; the fantastical device (“projecting presence”) is narrated with the same calm, tactile precision as the mundane. Modulation is subtle but present—moments like the letter’s arrival tighten rhythm and phrasing. Overall the voice feels singular and confident enough for top-tier venues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The line-level work is dense but largely disciplined: most metaphors are fresh, coherent, and multi-functional (“bottles flowering with message,” “ink slumped like tired soldiers”). There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or concept. The only arguable drawback is the near-constant figurative intensity, which edges toward saturation in places but does not blur meaning or obscure the closure image. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the piece propulsive despite its lyric mode.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The central premise—an itinerant writer of “obituaries for the living” who projects presence to craft “explained absences”—is striking and feels genuinely new. The fusion of this vocation with civic bureaucracy (the registry under “Compassion”), a quasi-magical method, and a tactile object (the carpet thread) yields a specific, memorable synthesis. The final repricing of travel and staying is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight, grounded in the story’s prior beats. The risk of such high-density lyricism in a conceptual frame pays off in a way that would stand out in elite literary markets.</comment>
