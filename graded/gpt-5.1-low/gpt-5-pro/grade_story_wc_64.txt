<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rowan’s gentleness, obsessive orderliness, and vocation as a listener are clear and consistently dramatized, and his core motive—to “discover the shape of intentions”—credibly drives every choice. The key interior turn is the decision to reinterpret the chess tutor’s final act and physically “carry the king half a square,” which is well earned by prior setup with the tapestry and case. What’s slightly missing at a top-tier level is a sharper sense of Rowan’s own contradiction or cost beyond quiet weariness; he reads a bit saintly and unopposed. A hint of personal stake or blind spot would deepen him further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The accumulative structure is clean: night work → ascent to silo → engagement with tapestry/case → chess reenactment → descent back to graves, with each step logically following the last. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: after decoding the tutor’s intention, Rowan alters the narrative by reenacting the endgame, letting the clock run out and easing the “uncharted echoes,” a clear before/after with emotional cost. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens; nothing vital teleports or contradicts. The only reason this doesn’t push into the 9s is that the external situation remains static, so structural stakes feel quiet rather than knife-edged.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cemetery, cobalt silo, tapestry, and chess clock are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Rowan’s sensibility as a gardener of both earth and grief. Environment and objects materially constrain action: he must climb the spiral ladder, use the tapestry as interface, and time his ritual with the chess clock, and the final image of the silo “holding its breath” and combed grave paths powerfully recharges earlier details. The tone and world rules feel internally consistent despite the occult elements. This integration of setting with method and theme is strong enough for the high band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether unresolved intentions of the dead can be softened or re-mapped—is present early and tightens around the chess tutor’s unfinished game. Escalation is internal and accumulative rather than dramatic: Rowan focuses from general echo-listening to a specific case, decodes its “map of wanting,” and then enacts a costly, time-bound ritual with the clock and board. The price is subtle but legible: he commits time, attention, and emotional labor to revising a story he could have left hardened. The conflict never sharpens into true peril or dilemma, which keeps it strong but not searing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of intention versus outcome, grief as something to be “gardened,” and the danger of stories hardening into false certainties emerge organically from Rowan’s practice and the chess tutor’s misremembered endgame. Images like moss on graves, frayed tapestry borders, and the half-square king move give the piece a coherent moral texture about gentling narratives without erasing cost. A few lines edge toward explicit thesis (“Intent is a shape, the tapestry whispered,” “Velveteen gloom suits certain truths”), which slightly reduces the felt need for reader inference. Overall, though, the final notion of “odd cartography” and a night “growing kinder” offers a resonant, non-literal answer without full-on moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The third-person voice is tightly aligned with Rowan’s sensibility and maintains a distinct, lyrical texture—“pruning moss like errant thoughts,” “a harbor waiting for maps”—without losing clarity. Diction and rhythm are controlled and purposeful, sustaining a steady psychic distance that feels intimate but not confessional. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the small amount of lineated quasi-omniscient insight (e.g., “they said”) is clearly filtered through the narrative frame. The modulation from wonder to quiet release at the end is especially deft.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The line-level work is consistently strong: high information density, varied syntax, and metaphors that usually reinforce the core conceits of weaving, cartography, and gardening. Nearly every sentence pulls double duty for atmosphere and character, and the final paragraphs land with clean, specific images rather than abstract summary. The main limiter is the sheer density of figurative language—while mostly coherent, it occasionally approaches overload and risks reader fatigue in a longer piece. Still, there are no real artifacts, loops, or muddled comparisons, and closure remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a cemetery gardener, an occult tapestry, a chess tutor’s unfinished intention, and an “observatory for the dead” feels both fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The method of listening to the dead by decoding frayed borders and using a sovereign case as a kind of sextant is particularly inventive, as is the re-framing of grief work as meticulous, nightly cartography. The story commits fully to its soft-magic premise without hedging into explanation, and the emotional logic of softening stories rather than fixing outcomes is distinctive. This combination of elements and stance would be memorable in a high-level literary venue.</comment>
