<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The keeper’s motivation—to decode and deliver the dead man’s gesture—is clear, consistent, and organically intensified by his self-description as someone who “trusted what was missing more than what showed.” His interiority is particular and embodied in perception (e.g., “the darkness between beams”) rather than labels. The enduring choice to keep signaling after Mira’s apparent receipt reads as an Earned Stasis that forecloses a simpler, unburdened solitude. Internal contradiction (content in isolation yet craving purpose via others’ unfinished gestures) is implied rather than fully dramatized, which keeps this just short of peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The causal spine—man dies → flower and gesture → investigation via gaps → encoded light → Mira’s acknowledgment → keeper’s ongoing signaling—is clean and legible despite the lyric texture. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: his role shifts from mere lighthouse keeper to ongoing custodian of “borrowed memories,” with the cost of deepened, conscious isolation. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a strong causal undercurrent, and the final choice is fully earned by prior beats. The only restraint is that the investigative deduction (from gaps in light/whistles to the specific name Mira) leans slightly on poetic logic rather than fully grounded procedure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is richly specific (opal dock, mist, slate water, lightroom) and consistently filtered through the keeper’s sensibility so it never feels like static description. The lighthouse and harbor directly constrain choices: his only way to act is through beam modulation and ritual returns to the dock. Recurring objects-as-setting—the flower, oilskin, jar of salt—charge the final image with a sense of duty and preservation. A hairline concern is that the intensity of description is uniformly high, which slightly blurs urgency hierarchy between high- and low-pressure moments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the keeper can successfully interpret and transmit the stranger’s final gesture—is clear and narrows as he commits to more specific tactics (modulating the light, returning nightly, adopting the signal pattern). Pressure escalates in an accumulative way: from curiosity to obligation to ritual collaboration with the dead man. The arrival of the liner and Mira’s silent reply provide a satisfying tightening and visible price (the keeper’s acceptance of his role as in-between). The conflict is intentionally quiet and mostly internal, which fits the piece but keeps perceived stakes modest rather than knife-edge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—communication through absence, the ethics of witnessing, and how isolation becomes a form of service—emerges naturally from motifs of mist, gaps, and light rather than from explicit moralizing. The Edelweiss and “borrowed memories” reweight at the end, moving from puzzle to sacrament the keeper preserves in salt. The final realization that “some messages are for the carrier as much as the receiver” elegantly reframes everything without lapsing into platitude. A slight density of overt aphoristic lines (“gaps are the letters of the tide”) flirts with overstatement but mostly stays earned by scene work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The first-person voice is distinctive and consistent, marked by a strong perceptual bias toward absence and metaphor (“a clock forgetting its numbers,” “the seam of the world unthreading”). POV control is tight; there’s no head-hopping or unmotivated knowledge. Rhythm modulates well, with longer, lusher sentences in reflective beats and cleaner, more pointed ones at structural turns (the man’s collapse, the liner’s approach). The only caution is that the uniformly elevated diction risks feeling slightly authorial rather than fully inseparable from this specific keeper’s sociolect, though it still reads coherent for a reflective, solitary narrator.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line by line, the prose is highly crafted, with vivid metaphors that usually do double duty for atmosphere and theme. There is minor risk of figurative saturation—nearly every sentence carries an image—which could fatigue some readers and very slightly softens impact by diminishing contrast. Nonetheless, clarity is never lost, and there are no notable loops or scaffolding sentences. Because the lushness is pattern-taught from the first line and paid off thematically, it reads as an intentional aesthetic rather than purple excess, just shy of razor-perfect economy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The combination of a lighthouse keeper decoding a deathbed gesture via “gaps” in light and sound, plus the quasi-mystical “borrowed memories” from a mountain flower, feels genuinely fresh. The story fully commits to its conceit of absences as language, following that logic all the way through to the closure image. Emotional truth—about service, loneliness, and the asymmetry of messages—is specific and avoids genre-template beats. Its risks are mostly formal (high lyricism, quiet stakes) and they pay off cleanly, leaving only a faint sense that the deduction puzzle is more poetic than investigatively surprising.</comment>
