<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ghost’s motive—to win Rowan an “encore” of courage—is clear, particular, and consistently expressed through his tactics with the orchard. Rowan herself is sketched mostly through poetic externalization (cracked hands, talking to exit signs, abandoned blueprint), which is vivid but keeps her interior conflict a bit distant. The ghost’s synesthetic perceptions give him a distinctive inner life, but we rarely see him under true pressure or caught between contradictory impulses. The final stance change—Rowan recommitting to her nursery plan—is earned but emotionally a shade too tidy for top-tier character work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is clean: ghost wakes → enters orchard → flips coin/creates echo → Rowan follows → blueprint recovered → future-oriented plan set. Causality is legible and each beat follows from the previous through the orchard’s logic, with the coin and echoes functioning as concrete mechanisms rather than hand-waving magic. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Rowan’s “Please keep the path tomorrow” and the orchard’s answer reweight the opening despair with a new, earned trajectory. The main limitation is that costs and risks remain implied and gentle rather than sharply dramatized, which slightly softens the sense of irreversible before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theater-orchard-hedge-maze complex is richly specific and fully integrated, from chiming pears and humming plums to the hidden prop shed and blueprint crate. Setting is not postcard dressing: the maze’s rearrangement, the concealed orchard, and the after-hours theater directly constrain where characters can go and what they can do. Sensory detail is inventive and strongly filtered through the ghost’s synesthesia, giving the world a coherent, idiosyncratic physics that supports the tone. The only reason this doesn’t climb higher is that environmental constraint, while present, never corners the characters into a truly hard on-page choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Rowan will reclaim a sense of possibility—is clear and present from early on, and pressure accumulates as the ghost intervenes, Rowan follows the echo, and the abandoned blueprint resurfaces. The key tightening comes when Rowan explicitly bargains with the orchard to “keep the path tomorrow,” effectively committing to action. However, obstacles are largely atmospheric; the orchard is cooperative, there’s no serious chance that Rowan will refuse once the blueprint appears, and potential external pressures (budgets, city ledger) stay off-stage. As a result, escalation feels emotionally persuasive but somewhat low-friction for elite-conflict standards.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of encore versus ending, possibility versus despair, and places holding light for future beginnings emerge organically through recurring images (applause, The Star, echoes as seeds/time/thread). The final image—lime turning to honey in the maze as hammers echo future building—reconfigures the opening’s ghostly nostalgia into a forward-facing communal hope without stating a moral. Subtext around art spaces as community incubators and the quiet labor of caretakers (Rowan, the ghost, the orchard) is present and resonant. What keeps this short of top-tier is that the thematic arc is relatively straightforward, with limited moral or emotional complication once the blueprint appears.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The first-person ghost voice is distinct, confident, and sustained, with a strong perceptual signature (“I taste footsteps, I see the pitch of silence”) and controlled lyricism. Psychic distance stays stable, and the narrative never leaks into an authorial register that breaks the conceit. Synesthetic metaphors are varied yet coherent, building a recognizable internal logic rather than feeling random or generic. At times the density of ornament skirts the edge of over-lushness, but it remains legible and pattern-consistent, supporting rather than obscuring the narrative.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: sentences have rhythmic variety, carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character), and avoid obvious loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and thematically aligned, with very few mixed or strained metaphors; phrases like “cinnamon bronze, the scent of courage” feel earned in context. Momentum is good for a lyric piece—the story keeps advancing through images without stalling in static description. The main drawback is borderline excess: a few lines feel one metaphor too many, which in a prestige venue would likely invite minor trims for maximal sharpness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a stage ghost, a hidden synesthetic orchard, time as fruit and thread, and community-nursery blueprints is genuinely fresh and not a reskinned template. The use of echoes as seeds of time and the theater’s “second life” after closing give the piece a distinctive conceptual and emotional texture. The risk of dense, baroque imagery mostly pays off, producing a memorable atmosphere and an ending that feels both inevitable and surprising in hindsight. It stops just short of exceptional only because the underlying arc (despair to renewed project) is relatively conventional beneath the exquisite dressing.</comment>
