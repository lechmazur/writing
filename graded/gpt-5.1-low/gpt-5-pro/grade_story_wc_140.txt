<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrator’s psychology is rich and specific—“a ghost with legal breath” whose need for proof collides with her refusal to trust paper—giving her a distinct, embodied inner life. Her choice not to write anything down and to carry histories “in breath and gait” is a strong, character-driven renunciation with cost. The relationship with the woman near the end adds a credible, understated shift from solitary witness to shared practice. The only limit is that her internal contradictions never face a sharply peaked moment of decision; the arc is more deepening than turning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The accumulative structure is clear: we move from general harbor life and erased records to the poison label, to the barred-window office confrontation, to the alliance with another listener. Causality under a textural lens holds: finding the label → following it → learning the “no one harmed officially” truth → choosing to continue building an off-ledger archive. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: she accepts enduring namelessness while doubling down on her alternative system of record with a partner. Stakes and cost are present but stay largely conceptual and emotional, never quite crystallizing into a sharply constrained choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The port and container labyrinth are beautifully and precisely rendered—cranes as metronomes, mud as “archive,” hulls as “choir of locked rooms”—and always filtered through the narrator’s sensibility. Setting actively shapes what is possible: she lives between containers, moves in rows, shelters under tarps, and the bureaucratic office with barred windows becomes a spatialized embodiment of official erasure. The tides in particular charge the ending, reappearing as an ongoing erasing/recording force that frames her work. This is immersive and thematically integrated, with only the mild limitation that environmental constraints don’t directly force a tactical decision at the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how a person without legal existence can preserve erased lives—is clear, and pressure deepens when the poison label links to a dockworker’s father and an amended report that declares “no one harmed officially.” The visit to the clerk’s office is the closest thing to a confrontation, revealing systemic indifference and pushing her toward her off-the-books archive as an Earned Stasis. However, the conflict remains largely internal and atmospheric; there is no strong on-page narrowing of options or explicit trade-off beyond her continued refusal of paperwork. Tension is sustained, but escalation is more tonal than decisively situational.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The themes of erased histories, bureaucratic violence, and alternative modes of remembrance are woven through nearly every image, from container codes replacing dock nicknames to the tide “rubbing away letters.” The final movement—her choice to teach another woman to “build our own ears from rust” and follow verbs rather than names—reweights the whole piece as a manifesto of counter-archiving. There is no explicit moralizing; meaning emerges from particulars like the poison label and the father’s death “with only an invoice.” The complexity is real and unsummarized, though the argument (official records vs living memory) is legible enough to feel slightly more stated than obliquely discovered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The first-person voice is highly distinctive, dense with metaphor yet controlled, and consistently tied to this narrator’s way of seeing (“a murder that had learned to bathe,” “a map without lines or legends”). POV is stable and plausibly limited; even when she imagines what containers or the dead “prefer,” it reads as lyrical projection, not omniscience. Dialogue is sparse but effective, especially the woman’s line about machines never listening, which carries subtext about power and dispossession. The only minor check is that the lyric compression sometimes verges on uniform cadence, reducing dynamic range under emotional peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The line-level craft is excellent: sentences are musical, information-dense, and typically do multiple jobs (image, theme, character) without obvious scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is frequent but rarely muddled; images like “a murder that had learned to bathe” or “beads threaded by someone else's error” feel sharp rather than ornamental. Rhythm varies enough to keep momentum, and key beats (the office, the father’s death, the final alliance) remain clear despite the lyric density. At times the sheer saturation of metaphor slightly blurs edges between distinct sensations, keeping this just shy of flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of a death-certificate error survivor with a container-port labyrinth and a practice of oral/ambient archiving is strikingly fresh. Treating bureaucratic misfiling as a kind of haunting, and shipping codes and poison labels as sites of contested memory, feels both conceptually inventive and emotionally grounded. The closing step of turning solitary witness into a small, rust-built counter-institution with another woman is a non-obvious, satisfying extension. Its one limit is that it leans into a familiar literary concern (erasure by systems) rather than carving out an entirely new thematic terrain.</comment>
