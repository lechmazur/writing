<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s trauma, professional purpose, and ethical revulsion fuse into a very specific psyche; “drone strike wedding survivor” plus the geode as wedding gift roots everything in her history. Her conflicting motives (grant/board vs ghosts vs self-preservation) surface in concrete choices, culminating in refusing extraction and signing “unwilling to be a weapon,” which feels fully earned. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“taste iron in my mouth,” “the past is a vacuum pump”) rather than diagnostic. The only slight limit is that her relationship with Liyun stays thinly sketched, so the relational crucible is underused.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural structure is clean: we move from setup (cooling observatory, hunt resuming) to discovery of the unused-potential pool at the massacre site to the ethical decision not to mine it. Causality holds under the lyric mode—the instrument work leads to the spectral valley, which links to her past, which forces the moral choice to publish coordinates and lock access. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: they forego the extraction path with on-page cost (institutional anger, lost “miracle”) and a reweighted sky image. All stakes and world rules relevant to this decision are in place before the turn, with no retroactive patching.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The floating observatory, desert, and instruments are rendered with striking, purposeful specificity (“creaks like a cathedral lantern,” “decks hum like dragonflies trapped in bottles”). Setting is tightly filtered through the narrator’s trauma—sky as verdict, salt flats like unreadable palm lines—and the observatory functions as a literal shelter that makes her work possible, not just a backdrop. The geode works as micro-setting/tool that directly charges the turning point when placed at the boundary and later as a “small planet of quartz” in the final image. I’m holding just below 9 because while the environment deeply colors meaning, it only lightly constrains tactics in the peak beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The central stake—whether to exploit the reservoir of unused potential linked to a massacre—is clear and sharpened by institutional vs personal pressures. Escalation is primarily internal but legible: scientific curiosity and professional obligation collide with triggered memory as they locate the valley “right where the convoy dust once hung,” tightening until the choice to leave the pool intact. The cost (grant expectations, possible loss of a “miracle,” and refusal to weaponize trauma) is clearly stated and felt, especially in “saving nothing on purpose.” The only restraint is that antagonistic pressure from the board/grant remains offstage, so external conflict is more implied than dramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of exploitation vs mercy, the ethics of mining trauma/“unused potential,” and learning to leave wounds unharvested are woven through concrete images rather than abstract sermonizing. Recurring motifs—the geode, sky as verdict/jury, reservoirs at sites of murder—shift meaning by the end, so the final choice not to extract reads as an earned moral stance, not a stated lesson. Lines like “Every site of murder is a reservoir, it seems” skate close to explicit thesis but are anchored in embodied memory (rice, ring, child) and immediately tested by action. The last paragraph’s repricing of the sky (“no longer feels like a verdict, only a jury… unsure, awake”) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent, blending scientific lexicon with lyrical, trauma-soaked imagery in a way that feels character-specific. POV boundaries are clean; we never slip inside Liyun’s head, and all inference stays plausible for the narrator. Rhythm modulates effectively between dense metaphoric stretches and plainer procedural lines (“We release a seed of noise into the field and watch the spectral map bud and flower”). A few metaphors are elaborate enough to flirt with over-stylization, but the pattern is taught early and maintained, so it reads intentional rather than indulgent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The line-level craft is strong: high information density, minimal scaffolding, and sentences that often do double or triple duty (“Bleak exhilaration lifts me, the rush of saving nothing on purpose, the mercy of learning to leave”). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically focused on sky, light, reservoirs, and instruments, avoiding mixed or confusing metaphors. There are no noticeable loops or synonym churn; each sentence tends to introduce a fresh angle or deepen an existing image. I’m slightly below 9 because the sheer density of imagery occasionally risks saturation, with a few lines feeling more ornamental than strictly necessary to the core beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of drone-war trauma with a quasi-quantum hunt for “unused potential” in a floating observatory is genuinely fresh, and the geode-as-survivor/instrument is an inspired, specific choice. The ethical problem—whether to mine reservoirs created by violence—is an unusual, conceptually rich angle on both SF and trauma narratives. The story commits fully to its premise’s implications, following through to a quiet but sharp refusal to weaponize the discovered resource. Some elements (perturbation theory, institutional pressure) are sketched rather than deeply systematized, which keeps this just shy of truly exceptional territory.</comment>
