<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motivation as a “gentle radical” with “aberrant mercy” is vivid and consistent, and micro-choices (coming to the plaza, staying for the patrol, how they speak to the leader) clearly express a hierarchy of values. Interiority is specific and embodied through images like “arms of steel” and being “retrocognitively trapped.” The patrol leader, though briefly seen, feels dimensional—his “title-heavy” weariness and hunger are convincing. The internal conflict between being bound to the past and needing to act in the present could be shaded with slightly more friction under peak pressure, but feels real enough for this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The accumulative structure is clean: present-tense waiting for the patrol is interwoven with retrocognitive glimpses until the confrontation, where those glimpses become a tactic. Causality under the chosen lens holds: the tessera and plaza memories enable the narrator to defuse the patrol by invoking the leader’s past and renaming the threat. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the plaza’s role, the leader’s stance, and the narrator’s self-conception all shift, with a felt cost in the ongoing burden (“The world will ask for more than this”). The only reason this doesn’t reach higher is that the external danger resolves a bit smoothly; the risk of failure could be more sharply edged.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is intensely specific and charged: “ancient plaza,” “shattered sky,” charred cedar, ash, and the collapsed minaret all feel tactile and lived-in. Environmental details actively shape events—the plaza stones and mosaic stepping stone are both memory medium and ritual ground, and the plaza’s status as patrol territory drives the central scene. The shattered sky and ruins also mirror the ethical fracture around mercy and law without lapsing into overt symbolism. The recurring physicality of stone, dust, and glass charges the final image of the tessera and the “soft armored rooms,” satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The main stake—whether the narrator can protect the people from the patrol’s punitive hunger using their aberrant mercy—is clearly established and tightened by the ticking approach of noon. Escalation is modest but coherent: anticipation → arrival → the high-stakes naming scene where any misstep could trigger violence. The protagonist’s agency directly shapes the outcome by choosing to expose the leader’s past and rename everyone as “ordinary,” foreclosing open resistance in favor of moral judo. The danger feels real, but the patrol’s stand-down comes slightly quickly, with limited visible cost beyond ongoing burden and risk; a hair more resistance or near-failure would deepen the pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme is richly woven through action and image: mercy versus law, the power of naming, and how memory resists erasure all emerge organically from the tessera’s use and the plaza’s history. Moments like “People think mercy must fit the ledger, but ledgers burn” and “law has no hands” sit right on the edge of aphorism but are grounded in the scene. The final repricing—renaming shard, cracks, and self—offers a non-literal, resonant answer to the central question of what mercy can be under oppressive rule. A touch less explicit thematizing in a few lines might give subtext a bit more room to breathe, but it’s already strong.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (stones, ash, naming, and bodily metaphors recur in a patterned way). Diction and rhythm are controlled, shifting gracefully from imagistic narration to spare, effective dialogue (“law has no hands”) without register clash. The limited interior access and time-bent retrospection stay coherent; the narrator never knows more than their position allows, even as they interpret. Under stress, the voice retains its texture without becoming muddled, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is very strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) with little redundancy, and rhythm varies enough to keep the lyricism from feeling mechanical. Figurative language is dense but mostly precise and thematically cohesive (“minaret collapsed like a sigh that forgot its breath,” “sky is a peeled fruit”). There are no obvious scaffolds, loops, or syntactic templates, and causality remains clear despite the poetic mode. On the margin, a handful of metaphors could be trimmed to sharpen impact, but they do not materially obscure closure or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The fusion of retrocognition, political repression, naming magic, and “aberrant mercy” feels genuinely fresh; it’s not a recognizable template reskinned. The idea of renaming danger and guilt as a survival tactic, mediated through a mosaic shard and plaza stones, is both conceptually and emotionally original. The final move—becoming “keeper of soft armored rooms”—reconfigures prior images in a non-obvious but inevitable way. Risk-taking in style and premise is high, yet the narrative remains legible and coherent, justifying a score in the low 9s.</comment>
