<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The summoner’s motivation—to divert the prophecy—is clear and consistently embodied in his methods, with his listening-led, modest temperament nicely implied through what he attends to. However, internal conflict is minimal; he never seriously doubts or feels torn, so his endurance at the end reads as extension rather than a charged renunciation. Emotional texture stays mostly in an elevated, contemplative register without many concrete bodily tells. The final resolve “to keep watch” feels apt but relatively low-cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece is structurally clean: one continuous ritual sequence from preparation through intervention to return to ordinary night. Causality is coherent—he comes to hush the code, deploys the wing, intervenes when a syllable rises, and the environment rebalances—under an accumulative/lyric lens. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the prophecy is defused, the world subtly righted, and his ongoing vigilance hinted. The main weakness is that the world-door stakes remain largely conceptual, so the cost and danger never fully bite viscerally.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The brookside night is vividly rendered through layered sensory detail (crickets, reeds, sibilant water) and stays tightly bound to the POV’s listening-based practice. Environment is not mere backdrop: the brook carries the coded prophecy, its “simple body” is read for places where sound leans, and the lattice of starlight across water becomes the operative field. The final image of a “gentled current” and a night with a “brighter shade of quiet” shows setting directly charged by the outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The central stake—preventing a dangerous sky-door from opening—is crisply stated, and the textural pressure of the code completing does build. Escalation is modest but present: the rising of a syllable “like mist” is the clearest tightening, prompting his decisive lean into the hush and later adjustment of the wing. Still, the conflict remains almost entirely one-sided and abstract, with little sense that he might fail or pay a price beyond concentration and vigilance. The result is a beautiful but relatively low-tension arc.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: restraint versus revelation, the ethics of doors and answers, and the value of attentive silence over world-altering knowledge. Images like the door “trying to be an answer for every question that pain had asked” and the crane’s added crease of gratitude deepen a meditation on humility and non-interference. The ending’s notion that “not every hinge should be found by longing” and that the world “still loved to be listened to” offers a resonant answer without quite tipping into sermon. A few near-aphoristic lines flirt with explicitness but remain grounded enough in scene to avoid feeling didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The third-person close voice is distinctive—lyric, image-dense, and calm—with a clear perceptual signature centered on gaps, intervals, and quiet. Diction is elevated yet consistent with a mage-like contemplative consciousness, and the syntax varies enough to sustain musicality. There is no POV leakage or unmotivated shifts; all knowing feels plausibly tied to his heightened attunement. The risk is that the uniform high-register lyricism may slightly blur sharper shifts in pressure, but control is strong overall.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is striking: many sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and motion) with relatively little scaffolding, and the rhythm of long, sinuous lines fits the meditative ritual. Figurative language is frequent but internally coherent—“a lattice of almosts,” “a hush like velvet”—and rarely feels mixed or strained. There is some density where nearly every sentence carries a metaphor, which edges toward overrichness and slightly softens momentum. Nonetheless, clarity is maintained and the final images land cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise and execution feel fresh: a summoner who specializes not in calling things forth but in “hushing” a coded prophecy via mapped silence and an origami star map. The combination of terrestrial brook, sky-doors, and “terrestrially cosmic” paper creates a distinctive cosmology and method. The restraint-focused resolution—protecting the world by preventing revelation rather than winning a confrontation—adds a non-obvious moral texture. While not radically experimental, the synthesis of elements is memorable and coherent.</comment>
