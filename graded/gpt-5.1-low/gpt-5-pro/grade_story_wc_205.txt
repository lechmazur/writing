<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Neris is sharply realized: a “defunct revolutionary” whose custodial role and poetic temperament create a strong, specific interior lens. Her motives are clear and consistent—she wants the verdict to redeem a civilization and, by extension, her own failed ideals—and her tactics (the calibration, the framing of kneeling as strategy) grow naturally from that. Internal contradiction is present but subtle: a would‑be revolutionary operating through legal ritual and aesthetic argument rather than direct action. The closing image of her “defunct heart” considering revolt again feels earned by the tribunal’s events rather than tacked on.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The structure is clean: a single tribunal scene, linearly unfolding with embedded visions from the shard, under an accumulative/textural drive. Causality is sound—Neris’s devised calibration leads to the shard’s tableaux, which reframe the dispute and enable the judge’s ruling—and the storm functions as a parallel pressure clock that tightens toward closure. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early despite the dense lyric surface, and the rules around visible time and storms are consistent enough for the ending to land. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: the city’s status shifts from quarry to “open conservatory,” with conceptual cost (a new civic obligation) and personal cost (Neris reaccepting the ache of stewardship and latent revolt).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid and visible-time environment are extraordinarily vivid—“baroque arches bulge from nickel cliffs, cherubs cut into ore, and gilt veins rise like liturgy from the crust”—and consistently filtered through Neris’s sensibility. Setting is not mere backdrop: storms, walking seconds, and the physical galleries all constrain behavior (covering mirrors, dimming lamps, storm-timed calibration) and enable the shard’s function. The world’s temporal physics and ritual practices directly shape the tribunal’s conduct and the options at stake (conservatory vs quarry). The final harmonies from the asteroid itself charge the closing image, making environment inseparable from theme and outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the ancient city is framed as decadent quarry or living conservatory—is clear and present from early on, and it meaningfully tightens when the judge demands “law, not longing” under the approaching storm. Neris’s agency drives the escalation: devising the calibration, choosing how to interpret the shard’s scenes, and explicitly asking for “liberty to reimagine an entire civilization.” The shard’s second tableau (the Ancients debating how to transmit their works) is an effective deepening turn that reconfigures the terms of the dispute. If anything, the external risk feels slightly soft—the judge’s eventual siding with Neris reads almost inevitable once the visions appear—but the ethical stakes and conceptual cost still land.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of historiography (decadence vs transcendence), stewardship of memory, and the politics of interpretation are deeply embedded in concrete actions rather than abstract essaying. Recurring motifs—burnished sorrow, visible seconds, mirrors covered during storms, children as custodians—shift meaning across the story and gather force by the end, where the city becomes an “open conservatory” and the shard is destined for “a chorus of small hands.” Neris’s revolutionary past and her reframing of kneeling, worship, and attention tie personal arc to the larger question of how power and memory are navigated. The piece skirts explicit statement when she says “I want liberty to reimagine an entire civilization,” but it remains character-driven rather than authorial moralizing, and the emotional aftereffect is earned through the prior images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The first-person voice is distinctive, confident, and consistent, marrying lush baroque diction with a revolutionary’s wary intelligence. Metaphors and perceptions (“time strings itself like harp wires,” “vault of walking seconds”) are particular to Neris’s role as poet-custodian in a temporally visible world. Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing both high-concept description and immediate procedural detail (how they dim lamps, sling the shard, cover mirrors) without losing coherence. There is no head-hopping or register drift; even legal and political language feels organically filtered through the same lyrical sensibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The line-level craft is exceptionally strong: sentences are musical yet clear, with varied syntax and high information density; almost every line pulls double duty for worldbuilding and emotional charge. Figurative language is frequent but patterned and coherent rather than muddled, maintaining a consistent metaphorical logic around time, metal, and liturgy. There are no noticeable scaffolding loops, clunky explanations, or copy errors, and rhythm adjusts appropriately around key beats (the storm strike, the judge’s ruling, the quiet in Neris’s quarters). The prose flirts with maximalism but remains controlled enough that momentum never collapses under ornament.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements—a baroque asteroid, visible time, archaeological jurisprudence, revolutionary burnout, and child-centered civic pedagogy—feels truly original yet internally inevitable once established. The reconfiguration of “archaeological dispute” into a fight over how future societies inhabit time itself is a non-obvious but well-grounded turn. Risk-taking in language and concept is high, but the piece follows through on its premises instead of retreating to generic sentiment. The final conceptual repricing—civilization as unfinished craft braided into seconds, to be stewarded by children—offers a memorable, specific answer to its own questions about history and responsibility.</comment>
