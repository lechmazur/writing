<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrator’s motivation is sharply defined (“I am here to find where unused love is stored”) and their choices—requesting the strip, performing the reading, deciding what to archive—are consistent and purposeful. The manager is lightly sketched but functions well as a worried foil whose tremor and questions keep pressure in the room. Internal contradiction is limited: the crystal gazer feels more like a composed specialist than someone under genuine emotional strain, so we don’t get much in-scene self-conflict. The closing stance—gentler archival care rather than exorcism—feels earned but not deeply costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The accumulative structure is clean: arrival in the booth → selection of film strip → psychometric journey through scenes → discovery of where unused love resides → ritual of cutting and archiving → charged final projection. Causality is coherent under a lyric, slightly magical framework, and the throughline of “relieving” the building’s weight gives the piece a spine. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the rules of what film/leader mean are reweighted with conceptual cost (unused love remains, relocated rather than resolved). Stakes are largely internal/conceptual, but the sense of before/after in how the manager will treat the materials is palpable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The projection booth is rendered with rich, precise sensory detail—the smell of “ghosted popcorn,” glitter from the ceiling, the purring projector—creating a tangible, lived-in world. Setting elements actively shape action: reels, leader, scissors, envelope, and the projector beam all define what can be done and how closure manifests (the blank leader glowing). The world-building feels internally consistent and thematically aligned with decay, memory, and light. A tiny restraint in score comes from sheer density of imagery occasionally edging toward decorative rather than strictly pressure-guided.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The central stake—locating and responsibly handling “unused love”—is clear and present throughout, but the pressure is quiet and conceptual rather than acutely dramatic. Escalation comes via deepening insight rather than reversals: from reading the images, to probing gutters between frames, to the revelation about leader and splices and the decision to physically harvest them. The manager’s anxiety about the building’s “heaviness” provides just enough external urgency to keep this from feeling purely meditative. Still, there’s little sense of an alternative path or significant risk if the attempt failed, which keeps the tension modest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Thematic work around what is cut away, the weight of unsent or unseen goodbyes, and mercy toward discarded fragments is sophisticated and organic. Motifs—leader, splices, goodbye letters, gravity, unused love—recur with shifting meaning, culminating in the luminous projection of “blank” film and the warm envelope of saved scraps. The piece avoids explicit moralizing, instead leaving readers with a charged image of archived, waiting affection that suggests both loss and possibility. A few lines skirt overt statement of premise, but they serve more as anchor than sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The first-person voice is confident, controlled, and distinctive, with an almost occult technical register (“alphabet of silver,” “topography made of sprocket holes”) that fits the character’s role. POV is stable and filters every image through the narrator’s particular perception; even the manager is seen in terms that reflect the narrator’s concerns. Rhythm and diction modulate well, with longer, lusher sentences giving way to slightly sharper declaratives at key turns (“Unused love is stored in the clear head of the reel”). The only restraint on a higher score is that the voice stays in one lyrical gear; there’s little modulation toward rawness under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The line-level work is strong: metaphors are inventive, often doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (“saving rain that fell between drops”), and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. Syntax varies enough to keep the ear engaged, and the long sentences generally remain clear despite high image density. At times, figurative language is nearly continuous, risking saturation and a slight softening of impact as images compete for attention. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum survive, and the closing images land cleanly and memorably.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The conceptual blend of film-archive mechanics, psychometry, and the metaphysics of “unused love” is strikingly fresh; the idea that emotional residue lives in leader and discarded splices feels both unexpected and inevitable once stated. Specific inventions—goodbye letters returning as gravity, clear leader as reservoir, the envelope warming with breathing letters—differentiate this sharply from generic magical-realism templates. The story commits fully to its premise without hedging, following the implications into concrete procedure (scissors, envelope, labeling an archive). Its bold, coherent lyric risk-taking merits a high score, just shy of absolute top-tier.</comment>
