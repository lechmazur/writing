<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The registrar’s interior conflict between preserving a fragile peace and risking it for transparency is specific and well-motivated, with the key beat being “If I revealed this, I would reveal myself.” Her choices (stealing the lens, staging the projection, logging a confession) clearly arise from that conflict and feel earned. Rell’s characterization is thinner but still distinct, largely through rumor and his silent, embodied response at the end. The mutual surrender to seeing at the projector lands as a credible change with emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The accumulative structure is coherent: rain/forecourt → lens → doodles → discovery of Rell → decision to project → public witnessing and mutual confession. Causality is clear enough under a lightly magical premise; no important setup is dropped, and the closure (they reorient the institution toward unsoftened truth) is on the page. Cost is legible: risking institutional trust and positions to restore a more honest relationship with history. The drive lens stays Accumulative/Textural throughout, tightening toward the public projection without structural wobble.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The museum at night and the “crystal whispering forecourt after rain” are vivid and consistently filtered through the registrar’s sensibility. Setting is not postcard-bonus; it shapes the action (the forecourt as site of public projection, the rain and tiles and lamp halos interacting with the lens and doodles). Recurring environmental details (rain, steps humming, lamp halos, paper confetti) charge the final images of standing in the rain with transparency as a posture. The world’s rules feel stable within this lightly surreal register.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to preserve a gentler lie or risk rupture via honesty—is clear and sharpened by the revelation of Rell’s substitutions. Pressure escalates as the registrar moves from private discovery to a deliberately public, inescapable showing, forcing Rell (and herself) into a stance. The final mutual, silent admissions and Rell’s offer to lead “unsoftened” tours constitute a visible narrowing of options with ongoing cost. The escalation is more moral and atmospheric than combative, but it remains coherent and does not stall.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—transparency versus protective concealment, and the idea that “seeing together can be truer than speaking alone”—emerges organically from objects and choices rather than sermonizing. Motifs of rain, lenses, replicas, and doodles all reweight at the end to support the notion of shared, ambiguous clarity. The line “mercy born from concealment shatters louder than harm” approaches explicit thesis, but it’s grounded in specific institutional misconduct and the narrator’s complicity. The final posture of standing in rain with open hands offers a resonant, non-literal answer without tidy moral closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The first-person voice is lyrically distinct yet stable, with patterned phrases (“after words become unnecessary”) taught early and reused in purposeful refrains. Sensory focus and metaphor choices (bowls, glints, ash, whispering crystal) feel like this particular registrar’s inward register, not generic “poetic” overlay. Psychic distance is well-controlled, staying close enough for emotional specificity while allowing some reflective abstraction. There is no head-hopping, and the lack of spoken dialogue suits the articulated conceit of a post-verbal world.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The line-level craft is lush and information-dense, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (advancing mood, theme, and plot simultaneously). Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent within a unified palette of rain, light, sound, and paper; it rarely tips into muddle. There is minimal redundancy and good rhythmic variation between longer, sinuous lines and shorter, declarative ones, keeping momentum. A very demanding editor might trim a few metaphors, but they do not materially obscure causality or dull the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The combination of a quasi-mystical museum night shift, a projector lens that reveals intentions, and a post-verbal social milieu feels fresh and conceptually integrated. Using doodled concert tickets as a medium for eavesdropping on institutional betrayal is particularly original and not a template move. The story takes a non-obvious yet inevitable-feeling path from private noticing to communal reckoning without resorting to familiar confrontation tropes. Its risks are aesthetic (dense lyricism, quiet stakes) rather than high-concept gimmickry, and they largely pay off.</comment>
