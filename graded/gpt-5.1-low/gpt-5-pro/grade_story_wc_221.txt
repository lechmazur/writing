<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s motivation—to stay behind and “turn confusion into exploration”—is clear, consistent, and drives every choice, from refusing evacuation to rerouting the lens. Interiority is vivid and character-particular (the mother, the compass rose, the family custom), with a believable mix of pride, hurt, and scientific devotion. The pariah status provides a credible, felt cost that the character accepts rather than resolves. Internal conflict is more tonal than sharply dramatized, but the final stance (staying, sending the pattern, needing no applause) feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Structure is clean: arrive alone after shutdown → observe anomalies → use family method to re-interpret data → discover valley as “true north” → realign the instrument and send the pattern. Causality is coherent and accumulative under a largely textural drive: the anniversary sketch comparison meaningfully tightens into the valley discovery. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing—time drift becomes path, ostracism becomes vocation—with a legible before/after. The stakes stay primarily conceptual and professional rather than concretely jeopardized, which keeps this just shy of the very top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The time dilation observation deck, glass dome, city, river, and mineral valley are all sharply realized and filtered through the narrator’s scientific and familial obsessions. Setting isn’t backdrop; the deck’s time-smear, the river’s reflections, and especially the bedrock valley actively shape what she can perceive and how she resolves the core problem. The compass and viewport-paper function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image and constrain her method. World rules (temporal gradients, residual echoes) are consistently applied and crucial to the story’s logic and ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether this “failed” array will be abandoned or re-understood—is clear, and the piece escalates from passive observation (smear) to active recalibration (aiming the lens at the valley, broadcasting results). Internal and external conflicts intertwine in her decision to act without institutional sanction. However, opposition is mostly off-stage, and her actions feel low-risk in the moment, so pressure tightens intellectually rather than viscerally. The cost is real but quiet (isolation, professional exile), keeping the conflict strong but not searing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of true north, honest obedience versus fear, and reorienting institutions through stubborn, lone attention are deeply embedded in objects (compass rose), customs (star-sketching), and the central scientific act. The family philosophy about true north directly informs the scientific breakthrough, creating a tight braid between personal and conceptual stakes. The ending image—leaving the sketch as a guide for temporally displaced others—offers a resonant, non-literal answer about endurance and guidance. A few lines edge toward explicit statement (“True north was not a magnet…”) but they’re grounded enough in character to avoid didacticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and textured, with a clear perceptual signature that blends scientific precision and familial myth (“time dragging light as if mending it”). Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing both lyric reflection and concrete action without confusion. Rhythm and diction modulate with pressure, tightening around the discovery and recalibration sequence. The absence of dialogue is appropriate to the solitude and never feels like an omission.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is dense but purposeful; most lines do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion, or theme plus action) with very little scaffold or redundancy. Metaphors are generally coherent and apt to the world (“the valley hummed back…a quiet order that made the smear a song”), and sentence rhythms vary nicely. A high concentration of figurative language risks occasional purple-tinge but rarely clouds meaning or momentum. Syntax, grammar, and sequencing remain clean, and the closure image is sharp and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The fusion of time-dilation physics, family sky-rituals, and a “true north” ethic for calibrating wounded instruments feels fresh and internally necessary. The “blessed pariah” angle, where ostracism becomes the condition of discovery, gives emotional specificity rather than generic lone-genius tropes. The conceptual turn—reframing temporal drift as guidance from bedrock—is a non-obvious but well-prepared synthesis that reweights the story in hindsight. Overall, it reads as a singular, confident vision rather than a template with new nouns.</comment>
