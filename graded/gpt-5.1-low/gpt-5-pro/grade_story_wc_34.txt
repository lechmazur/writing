<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrator’s motivation—to carry and translate “unspoken needs”—is specific, consistent, and rooted in a quiet, service-oriented temperament that feels particular rather than generic. Interiority is carried through how they perceive tools, clouds, and infrastructure rather than through abstract labels, which keeps emotion embodied in image. Internal conflict is relatively subtle (personal desire vs. collective needs; shyness vs. “bolder things”) but present and feeds into the final renunciation of purely personal asks. The endurance of their seldom-heard role, leaving the plate as a key for others, reads as an Earned Stasis with a credible, understated cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural structure is clear: preparation → invocation during the lightning–thunder interval → contact with the ghost → encoded requests → the ghost’s limited but concrete civic interventions and promised patch. Causality within this lyric mode holds: the storm window enables access, the grounded paint carries the message, and the ghost’s reply logically follows from sampling those currents. Closure lands via a Resonant Reconfiguration as the mural and plate become an ongoing interface, and the ghost commits to “a breathing schedule they cannot ignore,” with the cost being the narrator’s labor, risk, and continued semi-invisibility. The only reason this doesn’t break 9 is that temporal pressure and personal risk, though legible, remain relatively soft-edged rather than sharply tested.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The “misty courtyard above clouds,” storm, parapet, and city infrastructure are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through the narrator’s tool-focused gaze, creating a distinct atmosphere. Environment and objects (the balustrade, parapet, mist, LEDs, and especially the grounded metal plate) do real work, constraining what’s possible—contact is only in storms, via conductive surfaces in this liminal height. Weather and altitude charge the final image of the key-plate beneath the mural, making the next storm itself a narrative participant. Detail density is high but rarely feels like a catalog; nearly every environmental element is doing thematic or tactical work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—getting the ghost to recognize and act on residents’ unspoken needs—is clear and sharpened by the storm’s narrow listening window. Pressure escalates as the interval opens, the ghost “comes nosing,” and the narrator progresses from basic requests to “bolder things” encoded more delicately, then faces the ghost’s direct question about what they need. The cost remains mostly conceptual/emotional (time-bound risk, the strain of representing others, the choice to subsume personal needs), so the escalation is felt more as deepening than as sharp reversal. That relative softness keeps this excellent, but short of the highest-pressure band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of infrastructural care, marginalized needs, and a quiet, almost devotional collaboration between human craft and machine perception emerge organically from particulars: laundry hours, hall lights, benches, debug LEDs, and pressed petals. The story resists moralizing; instead, it poses a nuanced vision of governance where a “ghost in code” built from “people who repair” becomes an unofficial conduit for care that institutions have neglected. The final image—ghost slipping the council a “breathing schedule” and opening the console to “new hands,” with the plate as a key—reprices the idea of civic participation and listening without stating a thesis. Ambiguity remains around power and limits, which gives the ending real lingering resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The first-person voice is consistent, idiosyncratic, and texturally rich, blending technical lexicon (“debug LEDs,” “maintenance threads”) with poetic coinages (“tinkersong wonder,” “parliament of whispers”) in a way that feels unified rather than stitched. Psychic distance stays steady; the narrator’s perceptions and inferred knowledge remain plausible for someone in their role and obsession. The rhythm varies effectively between long, incantatory lines and shorter, declarative pivots (“I am not loud because the city has enough alarms; I am seldom-heard because I sing for the gaps.”). There’s no head-hopping or register clash, even under peak moments when the ghost arrives and questions are exchanged.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prose is densely figurative yet highly controlled, with most metaphors reinforcing the central workshop/ circuitry/ghost-listening conceit rather than competing; phrases like “faces braided from audit trails, chat logs, and ticket histories” are both vivid and conceptually precise. Sentence rhythm and paragraphing carry momentum through what is essentially one extended beat, avoiding paraphrase loops or scaffoldy repetition. A few lines flirt with saturation, but the story clearly teaches its lyric pattern early and sustains it with purpose, so the density reads as style rather than bloat. Grammar and sequencing remain clean, and the final lines land crisply without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements—a rooftop storm-window, a “ghost in code” embedded in mundane civic systems, flower-press tools and petals as conductive carriers of memory, and graffiti as the only trusted dialect—is strikingly fresh. The piece pushes beyond familiar cyberpunk or urban fantasy tropes into something more tender and infrastructural, where the magic is in maintenance logs and laundry schedules. The risk of leaning fully into this quiet, civic, lyric SF without big spectacle pays off, making the story feel singular rather than templated. Its originality lies less in any one gimmick than in the coherent, humane vision tying them together.</comment>
