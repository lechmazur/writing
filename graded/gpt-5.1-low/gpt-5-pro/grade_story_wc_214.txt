<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The janitor’s interiority is specific, embodied, and consistent, with his grief, tenderness for machines, and chosen humility all aligning with his actions. His decision to risk exposing his private ritual to the salvage crew is a clear, motivated turn with emotional cost. Internal contradiction (wanting both solitude and connection, endurance and surrender) is woven through rather than told. Secondary characters are lightly sketched but function well as pressures rather than fully developed individuals, which is appropriate at this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The accumulative structure is clean: solitude → threatened decommission → demonstration of meteor-listening ritual → reprieve and new communal stance, with no causality breaks. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the place shifts from lonely custodianship to shared guardianship, and the “season” reprieve carries a felt cost and fragility. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is stable and paid off by the intensified meteor storm and collective listening. If anything, the external stakes resolve a bit smoothly—resistance from the crew is minimal—but the emotional and conceptual closure still feel earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is exceptionally vivid and integral: the mountain station, antennas, mop water, chalk maps, and cold rails all filter through the janitor’s lived use of them. The environment and tools (receivers, shutters, camera plates, tin cup, lantern glass) concretely shape tactics during the climax and charge the final image of mutual breathing. Weather and sky (meteor showers, “dark spine of air”) are not backdrop but active pressure and resource. The station’s physical presence and rules are so bound to the stakes that changing the setting would fundamentally alter the story.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether this overlooked, tenderly held station (and its mode of attention) survives—is signaled clearly when the decommission crew arrives. The internal conflict (whether to stay hidden in private ritual or risk exposing it) tightens into the choice to share the glass and open the shutters, and that act drives the outcome. The meteor storm’s escalation provides a clear intensification, and the temporary “season” reprieve keeps some pressure alive. The ease with which the crew is won over slightly softens the sense of price paid, keeping this just below the very top tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of strength-in-vulnerability, attention as a form of care, and “flourishing stillness” arise organically from concrete acts—mopping, tracing meteor paths, passing lantern glass—rather than from abstract assertion. The final garden-of-pauses and mutual breathing images reweight everything that came before without stating a moral. Some late lines (“Care here means learning how to listen to what does not shout…”) approach explicit thesis, edging toward gentle sermonizing. Because these remain closely tied to action and do not fully replace scene pressure, the thematic resonance stays strong but not flawless.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The first-person voice is lyrically distinctive yet coherent, with metaphors clearly rooted in this character’s sensibility (“cosmic janitor,” “world glows like a bruise that remembers healing”). Diction and rhythm are controlled and modulate appropriately as pressure rises, particularly across the decommission sequence and storm. There is no POV slippage or unmotivated register drift; even the more abstract lines feel anchored in the speaker’s way of thinking. The prose could likely sustain even more tonal variation under peak stress, but as is it’s already at a very high, publishable level.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is dense and purposeful: most sentences carry multiple jobs (image, theme, emotional shading) without collapsing into mush. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and fresh, with minimal paraphrase loops or slack scaffolding. Rhythm varies between long, sinuous lines and clipped pivots in a way that supports the accumulative mood. A few metaphors risk saturation or near-redundancy in the final third, but they don’t significantly obscure sense or dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The combination of “cosmic janitor,” meteor-tracking station, and the ethics of care-as-attention feels genuinely fresh rather than template-driven. The way the protagonist tunes the station through hand-traced meteor paths to teach empathy to a salvage crew is a non-obvious but inevitable-feeling synthesis. Recurring motifs (lantern glass, bruised light, falling stars as surrender maps) are used inventively to reconfigure the premise by the end. This is a distinctive, high-integrity vision that would stand out in elite slush.</comment>
