<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The protagonist’s guilt, professional rigor, and love for Luca are woven into nearly every perception and choice, giving her a vivid, specific interior life. The core decision—to finally warn the valley and expose her earlier silence—is fully motivated by the history with Luca and the swallowed truth about the glide plane. Contradictory impulses (duty to data vs. protecting Luca, donors, and her own denial) are present simultaneously rather than in neat stages. The cost of change—accepting blame and inviting public anger—is clearly felt at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The structure is tight and causal: fever breaks → renewed attention to margins → illustration revelation → graphite weighing → warning call. Closure is on the page and costly: she shifts from complicit silence to active, public warning, with a clear before/after in her stance toward truth and risk. The oracle’s projections and the convoy’s climb give an implicit ticking clock, and there are no causality breaks or unkept setups. The final image of her standing at the rail reads as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise under a Hybrid causal/textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mountain weather station is not backdrop but pressure: altitude, avalanches, service road, and wedding convoy all hinge on this location’s risks and responsibilities. Instruments, aurora, and cold metal grating are filtered through a professional, grieving observer, so occupational detail feels lived-in rather than expository. The setting constrains choice—only she, here, with these tools, can issue the closure that halts the convoy. The final aurora and wind off the mast reappear charged by the decision and the “cleaner model.”</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The central conflict—whether to keep swallowing truth for comfort/reputation or to warn at real social and emotional cost—intensifies steadily. Past failure with Luca and the donors’ expectations load the choice to close the road, while the present convoy and oracle printout focus the external stakes. The weighing of graphite is an excellent deepening turn that reframes guilt into something she can finally act against. The resolution grows from her agency and leaves a visible price: closures, curses, and no absolution, only a more honest model.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Themes of truth vs. denial, margins vs. central narratives, and the ethics of prediction emerge organically from instruments, illness, and grief rather than thesis statements. The oracle’s “occupying margins” and the reweighted illustration turn abstraction into concrete acts: smudging, weighing, calling the valley. The story resists a tidy moral—her warning doesn’t erase Luca’s loss or her complicity—but offers a complex stance: cleaner models and painful transparency over comforting silence. The final act of taping the illustration back with the number penciled in is a subtle, powerful thematic answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The first-person voice is lyrically precise yet technically grounded, with a clear perceptual signature shaped by science, grief, and fever-haze. Anthropomorphizing the oracle and weather station feels like this character’s psychology, not authorial intrusion, and the pattern is taught early and sustained. Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure—more incantatory around fever and margins, tighter and clearer around the warning call—without losing coherence. There is no head-hopping or register drift; the elevated diction is plausible for this narrator.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prose is dense but disciplined: images like “it learned forecasting the way pain learns patience” or “a feather against the storm” do double thematic and emotional work. Figurative language is frequent yet unified around weather, instruments, bodies, and margins, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple overload. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and nearly every line advances character, setting, or stakes; there’s little to no scaffold or repetition. The closure paragraph is especially clean and potent, with concrete actions (speaking, taping, penciling) grounding the lyricism.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The fusion of a semi-sentient, wool-wrapped oracle, avalanche forecasting, and a literal weighing of graphite-as-guilt feels strikingly original. “Occupying margins” as both machine-learning method and ethical stance, and the use of a botanical illustration as a hidden hazard map, are fresh, specific choices. The story commits fully to its peculiar vision—no safety hedging or generic melodrama—and follows the implications to a morally thorny, satisfying end. It reconfigures familiar guilt/redemption arcs through a highly idiosyncratic scientific and atmospheric frame.</comment>
