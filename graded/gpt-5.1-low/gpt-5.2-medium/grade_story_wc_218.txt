<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and particular—her belief that “species watched one another” convincingly drives every choice, especially the remodeling under physical strain. However, she borders on saintly; we rarely see contradictory impulses or pettier emotions under the death sentence, which flattens her complexity. The monks function more as a foil than as true pressure, so relational conflict never quite bites. Her final endurance and handoff of the diary feel earned, but the cost is more thematic than deeply personal on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The structure is cleanly accumulative: diagnosis → recognition of the pillars’ script → remodeling → communal gathering → her lying down, with each step causally and thematically linked. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis—discovering the seed pods and nursery function redefines the temple and her life’s work as part of a larger, ongoing system. The illness clock shapes the arc but remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized through escalating constraints. Still, the story lands a coherent before/after: from humans interrupting the temple to humans entering the script as just one species among many.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly particular and inseparable from the story’s logic: living stone pillars with water channels, the temple orchard, crabs, goats, and birds all participate in the narrative. Environmental details aren’t postcard garnish; the pillars’ channels, copper arches, and tide patterns directly shape tactics and outcomes (water flow, crab paths, pillar “sweating less”). The final image of her lying between warm pillars under the remodeled canopy is charged by everything we’ve learned about the place. World rules around the semi-living architecture and ecology feel consistent and organically revealed through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stakes—what Mara can meaningfully change before death, and whether humans will join the interspecies script—are clear and do tighten as she undertakes physically taxing work and confronts monastic resistance. However, opposition is relatively soft: the monks complain once and quickly become students, and her illness only briefly manifests as an aching chest without escalating into consequential limitations or failures. The key turn is her decision to remodel in defiance of tradition, which successfully reweights options for all species. The ending resolves in a poised, low-drama acceptance rather than a hard ethical or practical trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme is powerfully integrated: the story interrogates human-centered sacredness and argues, through particulars, for architectures and rituals that speak across species. The fig–ant–blight anecdote, the crabs’ behavior under the copper arches, and the seed pods beneath the flagstone all build a coherent case that “architectural secrets” are about distributed belonging, not hoarded treasure. The gathering where each person vows a behavioral change edges close to explicit moral statement but is grounded enough in specific relationships to the island to avoid sermonizing. The final sense that Mara is unfinished because translation continues is a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening death sentence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The third-person close voice is assured and distinctive, with ecological attention as its perceptual signature (“which fig fed which gull, which moss quieted the bees”). Syntax and rhythm are varied and purposeful, supporting a calm, observant tone that suits Mara’s temperament and the accumulative design. Exposition is folded into sensuous description rather than feeling like info-dump. There’s no POV slippage or register mismatch; the lyricism feels earned and character-appropriate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prose is highly polished: nearly every sentence carries multiple functions (world-building, characterization, and thematic charge) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is vivid but controlled (“as if stone and wood had signed a pact”; “the orchard insisted on circles”) and avoids mixed metaphors or purple excess. Momentum is maintained despite reflective density because each new image also advances the pattern of interspecies negotiation. The final paragraphs in particular have excellent cadence and clarity, with no discernible line-level artifacts dulling the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a semi-living temple, ecological architecture, and an island caretaker quietly re-centering ritual around nonhuman communication feels strikingly fresh. The copper-wired trees echoing stone channels, the idea of an architectural script written for roots and crabs, and the reveal of the temple as nursery all transform familiar illness-and-legacy tropes into something singular. The story fully commits to its premise that “sacred” design can be multi-species infrastructure and follows through on the implications. The final configuration—humans taking vows under arches tuned for crabs and oaks—is memorable and non-obvious yet retrospectively inevitable.</comment>
