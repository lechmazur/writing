<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marek’s vocation, weariness, and stubborn sense of duty are sharply realized and drive his every choice, from not discarding the lens to enduring physical pain to finish the work. Interiority is concrete and character-particular (“the kind who keeps walking long after the funeral is over because the road still holds footsteps”). The internal conflict—his impulse to throw the lens away versus his compulsion to answer the dead—is present, though it could be surfaced in one or two sharper, in-the-moment hesitations. The final endurance choice feels fully earned and carries a clear cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The piece follows a clean causal spine under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens: package → lens → library → receiver → realization → repair → quieted sea. Orientation is immediate and consistent despite the lyricism, and the library sequence tightens naturally into the act of “revitalizing the quiet.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the dead are cataloged and housed, the sea’s weight conceptually lightens, and Marek exits with a changed relationship to his role and the cracked lens. The cost—time, physical strain, and his implied acceptance of being “the last volume to be shelved”—is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The underwater city library is vividly, specifically rendered (“stone arches lean like drowned ribs,” chained tables, wax-sealed books) and entirely shapes what Marek can do. World rules—kelp curtains, clearer inner water, impossible aisles—are consistent and taught through action. The environment constrains tactics (cutting through kelp, navigating impossible spaces, wiring lens into brass receiver) and powerfully charges the final sense of housed quiet and a lighter sea. The recurring object-as-setting (lens, receiver, stacks) is integral to both conflict and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the restless dead can be given a stable “address” instead of drifting forgotten—is clear and present from early on. Pressure escalates as the taps turn from distant signals into personalized coordinates, then into a desperate plea, and Marek responds by going deeper, stepping into impossible spaces, and finally sacrificing comfort and safety to sustain the light. Conflict is mostly situational and ethical rather than adversarial, but his agency directly resolves it by repairing the machine at significant cost. Stakes remain slightly abstract in emotional texture; one more beat of visceral dread or doubt could push this to an even higher level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of memory, ritual, and the ethics of care for the dead arise organically from Marek’s profession and the setting’s function as a literalized mausoleum of stories. “Give rest a permanent address” is dramatized, not preached, through his reading of the distress signals and his decision to bind the dead back to names and shelves. The final image of a quieter sea and Marek surfacing with the cracked lens reweights the whole narrative as a meditation on work that will never be fully done but can still matter. Ambiguity about his own future (listed as “the last volume”) enriches the thematic resonance without resolving into a tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The first-person voice is distinct, controlled, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature that marries professional detail to morbid lyricism (“my work is to give rest a permanent address when land forgets names”). Diction and metaphor feel native to Marek’s worldview—undertaker, coastal dweller, ritualist—rather than imposed. Psychic distance is steady and apt for a lyric piece, allowing both atmospheric description and clear tracking of present action. There is no head-hopping or register drift, and rhythmic modulation supports shifts from awe to strain to quiet relief.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The line-level craft is consistently strong: sentences are musical, information-dense, and nearly every image does multiple jobs for mood, worldbuilding, and theme. Figurative language is rich but largely coherent and legible; phrases like “chased stillness” and “shelves drift in slow spirals” accumulate into a unified texture rather than purple fog. There is some risk of saturation—most sentences carry a metaphor—which occasionally edges toward overrichness but never fully obscures causality or closure. Syntax varies enough to maintain momentum, and the final cadence is clear and satisfying.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of undertaker’s duty, drowned-city library, distress signals from the unburied dead, and a broken lighthouse lens as a cataloguing device feels genuinely fresh. The story commits to its conceit and follows it through to its implications (the dead as unshelved volumes, Marek himself as a future entry) without blinking. Familiar motifs (lighthouses, flooded cities, ghosts) are transformed through specific, idiosyncratic execution and a non-obvious moral calculus about remembrance and rest. The risks in both premise and style pay off with a memorable, singular vision.</comment>
