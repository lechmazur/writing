<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Celeste’s motivation (truth-seeking colliding with inherited guilt) is clear and consistent, and her final choice to protect the observatory while forcing honesty feels earned from the father backstory and her cautious skepticism. Her interiority is specific—treating headlines like planets, carrying the nib as an ethical talisman—and we see contradiction in her desire both to expose and to spare. Sato’s guilt is compact but credible, grounded in the damaged lens and lost colleague. The only limitation is that her emotional cost at the end is more implied than viscerally embodied on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: call → suspicion → journey → logical test → darkroom reveal → ethical bargain, with no serious plot amnesia or contrivance. Closure lands as a Decisive Change and mild Earned Stasis: Celeste forecloses the path of sensational exposure in favor of a constrained, quieter truth. The cost—sacrificing a blockbuster story and accepting a compromise solution—is legible but described more than dramatized in a pressure-cooker scene. A slightly too-smooth acceptance of the bargain by Sato keeps this just shy of elite.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The observatory above the clouds, the echoing domes, red-lit darkroom, and cocoa mug with moons create a vivid, tonally apt environment that mirrors doubt and isolation. Details are filtered through Celeste’s sensibility (e.g., charts “like laundry,” echoes rehearsing her doubts), keeping description purposeful. The setting modestly constrains action (remote location, controlled access to plates and logs) but serves more as atmosphere than hard tactical limiter. Strong, but the environment doesn’t quite bear enough causal weight to push into the highest band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether and how to reveal Sato’s fraud—is clear early and tightens as Celeste’s logical contradictions accumulate and the darkroom confrontation forces a choice. The turn from “expose the fake planet” to “salvage the institution by redirecting the story and compelling confession” is a meaningful reconfiguration. Internal and external conflicts interweave well, but the negotiation resolves quickly, with limited sense that Celeste is truly risking her professional capital or that Sato might refuse. Escalation works but could sustain a bit more frictive back-and-forth at the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of truth, guilt, and the ethics of exposure are strongly woven through Celeste’s inheritance, Sato’s “orbit of regret,” and the recurring planetary/orbit language. The final choice embodies a nuanced stance: truth must survive but does not always need spectacle, and regret can drive both fraud and its correction. The “orbits of regret” metaphor slightly overstates itself in one explanatory line, edging toward thesis rather than pure emergence. Overall, resonance is high and lingers, but the piece is a hair more explicit than the very top tier.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is controlled and distinctive—precise, slightly wry, with metaphors rooted in Celeste’s world (ink, planets, headlines). Diction and rhythm are consistent and well modulated between reflective and investigative beats, and dialogue (especially Celeste’s and Sato’s) carries subtext about power and anxiety without exposition dumps. The narrative never breaks POV bounds or drifts into generic register. A few thematic formulations (“orbit of regret”) feel a touch authorial, but not enough to disrupt the overall strength.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences are clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, often doing double duty for character and theme (“she treated every headline like a planet”). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and mostly non-redundant, with the planetary/ink motifs tightly controlled rather than florid. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; nearly every line advances mood, plot, or character. The occasional on-the-nose image or explicit metaphor keeps it just short of exemplary minimalism.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fusion of a newsprint heiress, an above-the-clouds observatory, and mathematical “proof by contradiction” as investigative method feels fresh and conceptually tight. Using planetary orbits as both literal subject and metaphor for inherited and personal regret is non-obvious yet organic. The ethical compromise at the end avoids a pat expose-or-cover-up binary, giving the piece distinct identity within a familiar “fraud in science” frame. It stops just shy of startlingly original because all elements remain comfortably realistic and could sustain even bolder formal or structural risk.</comment>
