<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The gardener’s interiority is specific and grounded—“joy is easier to carry than the headstones' dates” nails her psychology and role in one line—and her choices (agreeing to investigate, decoding, digging, planting) track cleanly from that. Alvera’s grief and need for an answer are legible without melodrama. The main lack is sharper on-page contradiction or cost for the narrator; she moves from reluctance (“I am no detective”) to competence very smoothly, without much inner friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The causal chain—widow’s request → silo investigation → tapestry decoding → ash-tree dig → ledger discovery → easing echoes and planting—is clear and satisfying. Closure lands on-page with both decisive change (ledger unearthed, secret understood) and a resonant reconfiguration (the night and echoes reweighted). Stakes and obstacles remain relatively gentle, but nothing breaks logic or undermines the arc. The piece holds a consistent causal lens while allowing lyric texture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cemetery, cobalt silo, chess table, and ash trees are vividly drawn and consistently filtered through the gardener’s sensibility, with details like “velveteen gloom, blue walls swallowing sound” doing both atmosphere and thematic work. Setting meaningfully shapes action: the silo’s history explains the tapestry’s existence and the ash trees provide the physical hiding place and final act of planting. The recurring objects (sovereign case, clock, ash) directly charge the closure. World rules and spatial relations stay clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering Tomas’s intentions so Alvera and the “uncharted echoes” can settle—is clear and develops as new information emerges. The main tightening is the discovery of the coded message, which reframes Tomas from casual player to protector and prompts the dig. However, antagonistic pressure is almost entirely offstage (the inspector, past dangers), and there is little sense of present risk or difficult trade-off, so escalation feels more like deepening curiosity than mounting danger.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of memory, intention, and caretaking the dead are woven through concrete images: chess clocks, ledgers, roots, and salt all accrue moral and emotional weight. The line “intentions have shapes like roots” is a rare explicit statement, but it’s justified by and anchored to specific prior images and is then embodied in the act of planting the new ash. The ending image—night transforming from shroud to velvet—reprices the whole piece’s relationship to darkness, secrecy, and care without sliding into moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The first-person voice is lyrically distinctive yet controlled, with metaphors that feel character-specific rather than generic (“I return to my rows with dirt under my nails…joy is easier to carry than the headstones' dates”). Psychic distance is handled smoothly, and the reflective, observant tone fits a cemetery gardener accustomed to both routine and the uncanny. There is no head-hopping or register drift; diction and rhythm stay coherent under emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prose is rich and precise, with most sentences doing multiple jobs of image, mood, and information (“The chess clock was their cover, because no one questions two men waiting on time, and the final silence meant the handoff was complete”). Figurative language is frequent but usually sharp and un-muddled; it enlarges rather than obscures sense. Line-level momentum remains strong with minimal redundancy, though a handful of metaphors and modifiers skirt the edge of “purple” in already dense moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—a blithe cemetery gardener acting as an almost medium-detective, decoding resistance-era secrets in a cobalt salt silo via a tapestry hidden in a sovereign case, all framed through chess clocks and ledgers—is genuinely fresh. The espionage twist is earned from the particulars (salt ledger, inspector, refugees, coded border) rather than grafted on. The final reweighting of night and velvet feels inevitable in hindsight because of the earlier “velveteen gloom” cue. It reads as a singular vision rather than a remix of familiar templates.</comment>
