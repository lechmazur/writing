<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mina’s characterization is rich and specific: her trauma, linguistic aptitude, and deliberate choice to work at the arboretum all converge under pressure. Her body’s reactions and her “pearl of stillness” strategy create a concrete, contradictory inner life (pulled between avoidance and deliberate exposure). The interaction with Dr. Harlow lets flaws and resilience surface without sentimentality. Her final choice to stay, bury the photo, and “keep growing in public” feels earned and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story runs as a tight situational arc: arrival of the research team → drone-triggered panic → negotiation of space and coping → re-encounter of the trigger under new tactics. Causality is clean (her history → job → panic → request to land drone → later recalibration), and the structure steadily tightens around the core stake of whether she can inhabit this place without dissociating. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she chooses continued return with eyes open, marked by the buried photograph and dated labels. The cost—living beside reminders of violence without numbness—is clearly felt on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The arboretum-on-a-cliff, salt wind, lighthouse lens, and fog create a vivid, coherent environment that’s always filtered through Mina’s attention. Setting actively shapes choices: sea-cliff acoustics trigger her, the lens becomes her grounding tool, and the exposed edge mirrors her project of “growing in public.” The final images—fog, dark lighthouse, labeled saplings with dates, photo buried at the cypress—are charged by all the earlier environmental work. There’s just enough weather and botanical detail to feel lived-in without becoming a museum tour.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Mina can coexist with drone-like sounds and remain at this exposed site—is clear and escalates through two key pressure points (the initial drone panic and later ambiguous buzzing). Her freezing mid-translation and subsequent negotiation with the teen operator externalize the internal conflict. The later choice to proactively seek stillness by the lens before panic “grows teeth” shows adaptation rather than reset. While the conflict remains largely internal and quiet, its progression and price are legible and satisfying for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of trauma integration, realism versus optimism, and bearing witness through growth are tightly woven into objects (lens, saplings, photograph) and actions (translation, labeling dates, burying the photo). The idea that “some sounds were not neutral” and the arboretum “not a playground for everyone” grounds ethical complexity without false equivalence. A few lines verge on explicit thesis (“the cliff taught a clear arithmetic”), but they’re anchored in concrete particulars rather than free-floating moral. The ending’s image of dated labels and her promise to “keep growing in public” offers a resonant, non-didactic answer to the story’s question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The close third-person voice has a distinct, controlled lyricism that matches Mina’s precise, traumatized yet analytical mind. Diction like “salt wind braided through pines” or “body kept a catalog of danger” feels consistent with a quiet, observant polyglot rather than an intrusive author. Dialogue is sparse but natural and functional, marking status gently (Harlow’s apology and question; Mina’s boundary-setting with the teen). Psychic distance remains stable, and shifts into interior framing (“pearl of stillness”) are clean and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, with most lines doing double duty (advancing scene and interior state). Metaphors are apt and consistent—lighthouse lens, crease-lines as “maps of ruined streets,” panic “growing teeth”—with no evident mixing or purple excess. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; rhythm modulates well between calm description and high-pressure beats. The prose supports rather than overwhelms the emotional core.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of an arboretum on a decommissioned lighthouse cliff, a drone-strike survivor as interpreter, and the lens-as-stillness ritual feels striking and non-template. The “pearl of stillness” concept and the insistence on dating plant labels (rather than wishing) give the piece a memorable moral calculus about truth and survival. The story risks quiet, internal stakes rather than melodramatic external ones, and the war trauma context is handled with specificity rather than generalized suffering. While not formally radical, the constellation of images and the emotional stance are distinctive and cohesive.</comment>
