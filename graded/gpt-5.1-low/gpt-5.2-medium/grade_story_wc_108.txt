<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s fear, adaptiveness, and dawning rage are specific and embodied, especially in beats like “learning new ways to hide my shaking in plain sight” and letting the boy see her tears. The tension between her phobias and her job reads as a genuine internal conflict that informs every choice. Vaughn and the boy are sketched economically yet clearly in terms of power and vulnerability. The final decision to walk in “trembling and certain” feels well-earned by the prior psychological groundwork.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The causal chain is strong: discovery of the file → flight to the library → decrypting the cast → confronting Vaughn with shell and projection → the crew’s turn and new future. Closure is decisive and on-page, with Mara changing from hiding to public exposure at real personal risk. The piece compresses some potentially rich beats into summary, but the throughline remains coherent and tight. Cost—risk of erasure and physical danger—is implicit but credible in context.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The rusted library, backlot, and soundstage are vivid and purposeful; details like “iron shelves bled orange dust” and “moths skated through moonlight like shredded film” create an eerie, cinematic atmosphere. Setting constrains tactics: the library yields catalog cards and charcoal, the soundstage provides the public arena and microphone. The seashell functions as a charged micro-setting-object, literally altering the final choice. World rules (props, vault, production codes) are consistent and integrated without exposition dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mara’s autonomy and survival versus being treated as an “asset”—is clear from the file discovery onward. Pressure escalates from private horror to collaborative decoding with the boy to a high-risk public confrontation with security present. Her agency drives the key turns: fleeing instead of taking the hush money, choosing to decode, then staging the reveal. A slightly longer dwell in the confrontation could have sharpened the felt price, but escalation is still coherent and satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of bodily exploitation, consent, identity erasure, and the weaponization of fear arise organically from the stunt industry frame and Mara’s transformation. The recurring idea that fear becomes a “compass” and that being “seen” is power gives a strong thematic spine. Lines like “I did not win by being fearless; I won by being seen” and “vulnerability is power” edge toward explicit thesis, dulling some subtlety. Still, the final image of signing her real name and taking the child’s hand lands with earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The first-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent, with images that feel specific to Mara’s world (“moths…like shredded film,” “backlot,” “call sheets”). The modulation from numb horror to tense resolve is well handled, especially in the “trembling and certain” cadence at the end. There is no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience; all knowledge stays plausibly within her scope. The lyric compression feels deliberate rather than generic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is dense but controlled, with most sentences doing double duty for mood and information; figurative language is vivid and rarely redundant. Images are coherent and thematically apt, tying film, props, and bodies into one visual vocabulary. Syntax varies enough to keep rhythm lively, and there are no obvious loops or scaffolding phrases. A few abstractions (“transformative,” “products”) skim close to thematic label, but they don’t materially blunt the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mash-up of stunt work, identity reconstruction, whispering prop, and cast-decryption as resistance feels genuinely fresh. The idea of an actress’s face literally rebuilt on a stunt double under secret contracts is a striking, high-concept betrayal grounded in industry detail. Tactics (using catalog cards, burnt scripts, and a seashell audio palimpsest) are inventive and character-driven rather than gimmicky. The final synthesis—winning not through badass fearlessness but through public, trembling exposure—reconfigures familiar rebellion tropes in an original way.</comment>
