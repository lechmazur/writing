<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara’s motivations (escape from drama into measurement, loyalty to Lupe, grief over lost telescope time) are specific and consistently dramatized through choices, not just told. Her “preprocessing” mindset colliding with the messy greenhouse yields real internal friction, especially when she resists naming the spiral “like a formula.” The shift in what she chooses to keep (accepting “slight irregularities” instead of discarding noisy data) is a credible, costed change. Lupe is sketched efficiently yet distinctly, adding relational pressure without stealing focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean and quietly tight: flood → reassignment → discovery of wing dust → decision to experiment → discovery of spiral → leak diagnosis → repair → changed dust maps and internal reorientation. The accumulative structure is well handled; each iteration of the experiment and each new observation subtly reweights both the greenhouse problem and Mara’s relationship to data. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: measurement is reframed as story and accumulation, with a visible emotional cost in how she resituates her grief. No orientation or lens ambiguity issues; the accumulative/textural drive is coherent start to finish.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse is vividly realized and always functional: broken panes, silt lines, humidity, and drafts are not mere backdrop but the very forces the dust records. Environmental constraints (sensor loss, leak, drafts, mold) drive Mara’s tactics and the practical stakes, and the storm damage is the enabling pressure for the entire experiment. The recurring objects (dust, black plastic, seepage corner) are tightly woven into the final image of the dust map on the door. The setting’s slow “learning to breathe again” elegantly mirrors and charges the thematic and emotional arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The stakes are modest but clear: practically, whether the greenhouse can be restored; internally, whether Mara can live with messy, story-laden data after losing her telescope nights. Pressure escalates not through big reversals but through accumulative discovery—finding the spiral, tracing it to the leak, patching it, and then reading the changed dust patterns. The cost is subtle but legible: she relinquishes the comfort of “clean signals” and her self-protective disdain for “drama” in favor of a more vulnerable engagement with change. A slightly sharper on-page moment of doubt or near-failure could have intensified the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of gradual change, accumulation versus headline drama, and the narrative nature of measurement are deeply embedded in particulars: flood damage, accretion and cooling, dust spirals, mold, and grief. The echo between pulsar glitches and the dust spiral is especially effective as an image-based thematic bridge. Some lines edge toward explicit thesis (“change was not a headline but an accumulation,” “measurement itself was a story”), slightly reducing ambiguity and reliance on subtext. Nonetheless, the final image of the dust map and the line about stars cooling by “listening to what fell upon them” provide a resonant, earned conceptual answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, precise, and colored by Mara’s scientific sensibility without slipping into dry exposition. Technical references (neutron stars, accretion, pulsar glitches) feel organic to her perception and are balanced by sensuous, concrete greenhouse detail. When Lupe appears, her plainspoken reactions contrast nicely with Mara’s more analytical lens, giving subtle voice distinction. Rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled, modulating between contemplative and observational without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The line-level craft is exceptionally strong: nearly every sentence does multiple jobs (character, setting, theme) with minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and grounded (“humidity curled the torn leaves as if each plant was exhaling a small apology”; “storm had not smashed everything at once but had worried it down”). There are no evident loops, mixed metaphors, or register slips; technical terms are sparse and precise. The final sentences land cleanly, recharging earlier motifs without overexplaining.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of a neutron star physicist using butterfly wing dust to map post-flood greenhouse drafts, paralleled with pulsar glitches and emotional cooling, feels fresh and specific. The metaphorical bridge between astrophysics and plant ecology is not gimmicky; it is worked through method, choice, and image. The “gradual change” premise could have been generic, but it’s made distinctive by concrete, non-obvious particulars (e.g., climate-control sensors gone, dust as ad hoc instrumentation). It stops just short of radically surprising turns, but the conceptual integration and quiet risks in subject matter and tone are high.</comment>
