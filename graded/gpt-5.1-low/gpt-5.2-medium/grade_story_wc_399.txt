<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Iri’s characterization is precise and distinctive—her peripheral awareness, half-mask, and “strangely honest” uncovered side all manifest in concrete choices, especially the risky bargain to lead the prophet onto the line. The prophet is efficiently but vividly sketched through tiny tells (his gaze, his fingers on the cup, the single quiet tear). Internal conflict is present but understated—duty, suspicion, and kinship in motive are felt more through perception than explicit turmoil, which suits the tone but slightly mutes the sense of struggle. The final alignment of motives (preserving wisdom without owning it) feels earned by their prior interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The structure is cleanly causal: prophet arrives → parapet destabilizes → elders’ fear → Iri’s bargain → risky dawn ritual → parapet steadied and relationship reconfigured. Orientation is excellent from the first line; the encampment, dunes, and underground parapet are clear and consistent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Iri chooses to trust and collaborate, the prophet calibrates his voice, and the parapet settles into “steadier sleep,” marking a clear before/after. The cost—risk to the parapet and to Iri’s standing with the elders—is present but held in conceptual tension rather than dramatized consequence, which keeps this just shy of a 9-band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The desert, dunes, ropes, and buried parapet are not just decorative; they constrain behavior (peripheral gaze, line-walking) and directly shape the ritual’s risks and tactics. The kinetic parapet aligning “like ribs under skin” and the vanishing/returning wind embed atmosphere in physical stakes. World rules (echoes as vibration, parapet twitching under speech-pressure) are internally consistent and discovered through action instead of exposition dumps. The pavilion is slightly less structurally crucial than the dunes/parapet, keeping this at a very high but not flawless level.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the prophet’s presence will destabilize or help preserve the sages’ echo—is clearly signaled via the parapet’s twitching and elders’ fear. Pressure coheres and tightens through Iri’s decision to offer a bargain and lead him onto the risky line, escalating from ambient anxiety to an on-page test of restraint. The internal–external conflicts (trust vs duty; teaching silence to someone whose power is speech) intertwine effectively but remain fairly serene in affect, which slightly softens the felt jeopardy. The resolution is convincingly earned, though the sense of what might have been lost could be sharpened one more notch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of speech vs silence, stewardship vs ownership of wisdom, and the ethics of charismatic authority emerge organically from the parapet’s function and the ritual rather than from abstract essaying. “The desert did not hate words, only noise” and the prophet’s aim to avoid his voice rotting “into command” distill thematic tensions without sermonizing. The final recognition that their motives match—preserving echo without owning it—reweights the earlier fear and suspicion in a satisfying, non-moralistic way. A hair more resistance or moral friction at the end could push this into the 9-band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The third-person-limited voice through Iri is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature centered on edges, peripheries, and subtle tells. Syntax and rhythm vary deliberately, supporting the hushed, tensile mood without becoming monotonous. The prophet’s spoken lines feel spare and in-character, with the real work done in implication and gesture. There is no head-hopping or register drift; the lyric elevation feels rooted in the world’s texture and Iri’s sensibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: high information density, almost every sentence carrying worldbuilding, mood, and character at once. Metaphors (“like ribs under skin,” “paced the pavilion ropes like a thought”) are fresh and coherent, and figurative language does not muddy causality. There are no evident scaffolding loops or clunky exposition; the prose moves with quiet propulsion appropriate to the tone. A couple of conceptual phrases (“conjured clearings,” “measured kindness”) lean abstract but are quickly grounded in concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements—kinetic parapet, wisdom stored as vibration, line-walking as a liminal discipline, and “conjured clearings” of silence—is strikingly original yet feels internally inevitable. The emotional problem of how a prophet might tune his voice to avoid becoming tyrannical is a non-obvious, resonant angle on familiar “chosen one” dynamics. Risks in worldbuilding and diction pay off cleanly; nothing reads like a stock fantasy template with new nouns pasted over. Only the relative calmness of overt conflict keeps it from feeling fully radical in affect.</comment>
