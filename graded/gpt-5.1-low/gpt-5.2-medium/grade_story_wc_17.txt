<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Liora’s motives (professional commission vs. private desire to hear “what walls dream about”) are clear and consistently drive her choices, especially her lie to the Restoration Office. The discovery that Arlen is her grandfather and that her mother’s voice is archived personalizes the stakes in a way that feels earned, not contrived. Interiority is specific and embodied through her acoustic sensitivity and physical mapping. The final renunciation (suppressing the chamber from her report) is well motivated with a legible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The causal chain from entering the ivy-veiled passage → finding diaries → decoding the film strip → revealing the vent chamber → making the report decision is clean and coherent. The piece lands solid Earned Stasis/Charged Poise closure: she chooses concealment at personal and civic cost. Structure is essentially one continuous exploration with rising discoveries, no orientation issues, and no broken setups. A minor limitation is that the Restoration Office pressure appears almost at the end, so the institutional conflict feels slightly under-developed relative to the family/architectural arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered—salt fog, heat, ivy veils, soot-tasting air, ceramic plates—and consistently filtered through an acoustic professional’s gaze. The environment is not just backdrop: vents, plates, and bricked-up spaces directly shape what she can access and discover. The “after the climate shifts” city and abandoned academy feel textured without exposition dumps. While the climate-shifted world doesn’t tightly constrain her final choice, the academy’s physicality clearly structures the story’s action and discoveries.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake is Liora’s ethical choice: whether to turn the echo chamber into a public artifact or protect its intimate grief, with her professional standing at risk. Pressure escalates through each discovery (family connection, her mother’s voice, the Office’s tourist agenda), tightening her options. Her ultimate decision to recommend closure forecloses an easy, socially sanctioned path and carries implied personal and civic cost. The main limitation is that the external consequences of defying the Office remain mostly implied rather than tested in-scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme around legacy, memory, and the ethics of curation vs. exploitation is woven through Arlen’s design, the diaries, and Liora’s final act. The “legacy’s burden” concept tangibly shapes choices rather than remaining abstract, and the ending reframes her role from extractive mapper to caretaker. The drones wanting a “comforting soundtrack” versus the chamber’s raw grief offers sharp social commentary without sermonizing. A slightly on-the-nose line (“her own job was not to steal the walls’ dreams but to carry them carefully forward”) edges toward explicit thesis but doesn’t fully tip into moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The third-person close POV is stable, with a clear perceptual signature grounded in sound, architecture, and inherited obsession. Diction is lyrical but controlled, matching a technically minded yet poetic listener; climate and tech terms sit comfortably beside more figurative language. There is no head-hopping or stance drift, and the narrative distance tightens effectively at key beats (e.g., when she hears her mother’s voice). Occasional high-register abstractions around legacy and burden still feel congruent with her reflective, specialized profession.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is generally tight, with rich imagery that does double duty for worldbuilding and theme (“where sound lingered like memory”; “walls dream about”). Sentence rhythm varies well and maintains momentum through descriptive passages. A few lines verge on density and conceptual repetition around legacy and burden, but they don’t significantly blur clarity or stall the scene. There are no obvious scaffolding loops, mixed metaphors, or grammatical slips affecting comprehension, including at the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of acoustical cartography, echo-preserving vents, and a film negative key that equates light and sound feels strikingly original. The premise that an architect archives family arguments into walls, and that a descendant must later edit which echoes face the public, is a fresh angle on post-climate-collapse memory. The story fully commits to its conceptual weirdness and grounds it in tactile specifics (interval numbers, ceramics, ivy-curtained passage). The only reason this doesn’t climb higher is that the Restoration Office/drone element leans a bit familiar in contrast to the otherwise singular conceit.</comment>
