<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Len and Yara are sharply etched with clear, conflicting motives—his need to reimagine, her need for restoration—and those motives drive every key choice. Interiority is concrete and particular (e.g., Len’s “poet’s habit of naming shadows,” his prison-learned mirror tactic) and their shared grief gives their courtesy bite. The final joint decision to stage a third-path exhibition is fully earned by what we’ve seen of their flaws and longings. If anything, Yara’s inner life could bear one more embodied moment under pressure to match Len’s depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The causal spine is clean: shard → meeting → storm/futures → map revelation → joint decision → exhibition, with each beat tightening options. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing and decisive change: they refuse both factions’ binary narratives and choose a risky, ambiguous public act. Cost is legible in the risk of both sides weaponizing or rejecting their compromise and in Len’s renunciation of pure revolutionary certainty. Structure is linear and coherent; one could argue for a slightly clearer on-page sense of concrete consequences beyond changed arguing in the plaza.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid, original, and fully integrated: visible time as strata, the baroque asteroid, the Mirror Gallery, and the storm all shape action and choices (covering mirrors, staging the exhibition in a crater during a storm). Details are filtered through Len’s sensibility, so they’re never generic spectacle. The environment directly charges the final image, where the map is projected through visible time instead of being fixed in stone. A minor quibble: some world elements are so lush that a couple may feel ornamental rather than strictly necessary at this length.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The core conflict—how to claim or release a buried civilization’s story—emerges early and escalates well via the storm, the dangerous mirrors, and the map’s reclassification of Palimpsest. Len and Yara’s personal losses entwine with the political dispute, and the map’s discovery forces a genuine trade-off between factional power and honest multiplicity. The final decision to exhibit the map ambiguously is a clear, agency-driven resolution that forecloses simpler paths. Stakes remain largely ideological and emotional; a hint more concrete risk (professional, physical, or social) on the page could sharpen the sense of cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thematic work is rich: the shard, vase, and map become convincing emblems of plurality versus single-story monuments, and the ending’s “vase becomes more honest when broken” line reweights everything before it. Theme arises mostly from the characters’ choices and the charged images of visible time and mirrors showing branching futures. The story resists tidy moralizing by letting people leave “arguing differently” instead of converted. A few formulations verge on articulating the thesis a bit too directly, which slightly blunts the otherwise superb subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and coherent, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in Len’s sensibility and history; the prose sustains its register without wobble. Occasional omniscient touches (Yara’s sister) are smoothly integrated and don’t jar the focalization. Rhythm and diction modulate appropriately with pressure, especially around the storm and the map-vision. Dialogue is sparse but pointed, carrying subtext and character contrast efficiently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is excellent: sentences are dense yet clear, with metaphors (“visible time… like slow auroras,” storm scraping the hull “like a bow on tarnished brass”) that are fresh and internally consistent. Information is compressed without feeling rushed, and almost every line does double duty for world, character, or theme. There’s no noticeable looping or scaffolding; rhythm varies well. A few sentences push toward the decorative, but they never quite tip into purple or obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of visible time, baroque space-architecture, political archaeology, and post-revolutionary grief feels strikingly fresh and conceptually unified. The twist that the court was a meeting ground and that the vase was broken as a ritual of choosing many futures is both non-obvious and well-prepared. Using an exhibition that deliberately refuses certainty as the climax is an elegant, risk-embracing move that fits the world’s logic. The piece feels singular enough that swapping in another setting or premise would break it, which is a strong marker of originality.</comment>
