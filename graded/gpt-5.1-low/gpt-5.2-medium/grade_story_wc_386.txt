<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s vocation, ethics, and investigative habits are clear and consistent, and her final choices (refusing hearsay, confronting Fen publicly, dedicating the globe to remembrance) all read as motivated extensions of those traits. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“spoken into her regulator and into her own ribs”), giving her a distinct sensibility rather than a stock “psychic diver.” The main limiting factor is the relative lack of on-page internal contradiction or moral friction—she rarely feels genuinely torn, which slightly flattens emotional complexity at peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: melted globe → suspicion of heat → Fen’s dream incursions → exploitation of “windows” → shared-dream sting → public exposure, with each step clearly motivated. The shrine and ice lens provide a tight present-time frame that anchors the flashback-like visions, and the ending lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the globe’s meaning and use are decisively altered. Some high-tension beats (tracking Fen, organizing the confrontation) are summarized rather than dramatized, which trims potential impact but does not break closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The glacier shrine, candles tinted blue by starlight, and the underwater wreck are rendered with striking specificity, and these details are not merely decorative: the ice lens literally conditions how Mara investigates and ultimately witnesses Fen. The recurring objects—the globe, the alcoves, the altar—directly charge the final image when the globe becomes a “gentler window of connection.” Sensory focus leans visual, but the few tactile and auditory cues (regulator, cold, candle flicker) keep the space from feeling like a static postcard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (protecting/returning “something pure” versus Fen’s predation on grief) is legible early and escalates as Mara moves from suspicion to proof to public exposure. Her ethical constraint against hearsay creates a meaningful tightening: she must risk making many villagers complicit via shared dreams to catch Fen. However, confrontation and consequence arrive relatively smoothly once she has the pattern, with little direct resistance from Fen on the page, so the conflict never quite peaks into a truly costly or fraught decision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of memory, exploitation of grief, and the idea that “purity” is something rescued and held up to the light rather than untouched are woven organically through the globe, the shrine, and Fen’s dream-harvesting. The final image—imagined snow in a distorted little world serving as a free “window of connection”—reweights the entire story’s economy of the dead without resorting to explicit moralizing. There is genuine complexity (Mara uses the same mechanisms of connection Fen does, but for radically different ends), though the villain is somewhat straightforwardly condemnable, limiting moral ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The third-person voice is tightly focalized through Mara, with consistent lexicon and a lyrical, image-rich texture that feels like it belongs to a diver attuned to ghosts and wrecks. Phrasing such as “voices rise like breath in cold air” and “translated only what she could confirm” establishes a distinct perceptual signature and modulates well between investigative precision and poetic resonance. There’s no head-hopping or register drift; elision around the exact mechanics of dreams and ghosts feels purposeful rather than evasive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, character, and theme) with minimal redundancy, and rhythm shifts gracefully between long, sinuous description and tighter explanatory moves. Figurative language is frequent but generally controlled and coherent, and key metaphors (windows, lenses, breath in cold air) recur with deliberate pattern rather than in a muddled pile. A few lines verge on density that could risk purple in a longer piece, but here they mostly enhance rather than obscure momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of wreck-diving, ghost whispering, dream-harvesting, and glacial shrines feels fresh, and the specific mechanism of exploiting reflections in water as a finite, saleable resource for dreams is conceptually sharp. The “windows of connection” motif—ice lens, dreams, globe, unshuttered window—ties form and content together in a way that feels non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Fen as an antagonist is somewhat archetypal, but the investigative method and the final ethical repositioning of the globe give the piece a distinctive signature.</comment>
