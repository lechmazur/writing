<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eamon is sharply and economically drawn—his boutonniere, solitary vocation, and investigative method all cohere into a specific, motivated person whose actions drive the story. The narrator is less individuated but functions well as a witnessing consciousness whose skepticism yields to participation. Eamon’s mix of competency and damage (his self-imposed role as “keeper of other people’s missing parts”) gives the closing realization credible weight. The only thing holding this back from the very top tier is that the narrator’s own internal contradiction and cost remain relatively faint compared to Eamon’s.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The structure is tight: arrival of the drowned man → discovery of the boutonniere → memory-fragment method → deduction at the unmarred piling → retrieval of the packet → naming and archival in the logbook, culminating in the narrator’s reframed understanding of Eamon. Causality is clean and accumulative, with each clue meaningfully following from the previous one under Eamon’s “observe the gaps” method. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the final realization about Eamon’s isolation and role as custodian of absences clearly reweights everything prior and carries a felt cost. There are no orientation issues or unkept setups; all introduced elements are either paid off or thematically harmonized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is vividly particular—the “opal dock,” mist, and lighthouse beam are not just pretty but become investigative tools (the unscarred piling, the tied-under packet, the logbook as final resting place). Details are consistently filtered through the narrator’s working familiarity with the harbor, preventing a “tourist catalog” feel. The environment constrains and enables choice: the post’s missing rope scars and the under-dock geography are literally how the mystery is solved. The final image of the lighthouse as “a far star that could not warm him” crystallizes the thematic isolation through setting rather than commentary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>For a quiet piece, the stakes—decoding the drowned man’s last gesture and what to do with a life reduced to fragments—are clear and present early through Eamon’s insistence on the “empty grip” as an unread message. Escalation is subtle but real: description of absences → deduction at the piling → discovery of the packet → choice to speak the name and archive the man’s trace. The pressure is largely conceptual and emotional rather than peril-based, but it coheres under a situational/accumulative lens and culminates in a tangible act (entering the man into the logbook) that forecloses anonymity. It falls just short of the highest band because the protagonist’s personal risk or loss remains more implied than dramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story’s themes—memory as fragmentary, absence as message, and the ethics of holding another’s history without owning it—emerge organically from action and image rather than thesis statements. The Edelweiss, the empty grip, the knot, and the logbook form a motif chain that shifts meaning by the end, reconfiguring “recovery of a body” into “creation of a place where his history can anchor without being owned.” The final realization about Eamon’s isolation as “keeper of other people’s missing parts” is an earned, non-didactic answer to the story’s implicit question about what we owe the nameless dead. Ambiguity about Eamon’s burden and the narrator’s ongoing role lingers productively without confusion or moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The first-person voice is consistent, lucid, and quietly lyrical, with a strong perceptual signature that balances workmanlike observation (“I was the harbor clerk”) and heightened image (“the lighthouse beyond breathed its beam”). Eamon’s spoken idiom and presence contrast well with the narrator’s more reportorial stance, giving their interactions texture without over-written dialogue. The narrative distance remains stable and plausible for a reflective recounting of a single charged encounter. The prose occasionally brushes the edge of lushness but remains controlled and in-character, never tipping into an omniscient or authorial register that would break POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentence-level craft is exceptionally controlled: varied rhythm, high information density, and figurative language that consistently clarifies rather than muddies (“footprints of intent,” “offering of absence”). There are no discernible scaffold sentences, synonym loops, or syntactic templates; nearly every line carries multiple functions (image, theme, and plot) without feeling overloaded. The prose modulates well—denser in reflective moments, cleaner and more concrete in investigative beats—keeping momentum intact. Metaphors are thematically unified around light, cold, and absence, avoiding mix or drift, which helps the closure image land sharply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of a maritime recovery scene with a quasi-mystical “borrowed memories from objects” investigator is a fresh, non-obvious premise. Investigating via absences (no sand in the boots, missing rope scars, the wrong kind of knot) is a particularly inventive twist on detection. The emotional core—trading away one’s own mind, and another man quietly curating that loss—is specific enough that this couldn’t be easily reskinned into a generic mystery. It stops short of the most radical structural or formal risk, but within a relatively classical frame, it feels distinct and memorable.</comment>
