<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sava is sharply sketched as a cryptic, obsessive specialist whose actions (walking until his soles bleed, using the fork as a “compass”) consistently serve his stated motive of restoring balance. His interiority is mostly implied through behavior and metaphor rather than direct thought, which fits the fable-like tone but slightly flattens psychological nuance. Mara’s mini-arc from baffled observer to co-creator of the rhythm is clear and credible, though still thin. The final communal shift feels earned by their accumulated choices, but the individual emotional cost remains more mythic than deeply personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The structure is cleanly causal and accumulative: Sava diagnoses the problem, experiments with rhythm, gradually enlists others, and this culminates in the decree-carrier’s reversal when the town “proves itself alive.” The throughline from imbalance → tuning experiments → communal cadence → political reprieve is coherent and legible. Closure is decisive—the district is not abandoned—and the “before/after” for the town is unmistakable. The main weakness is that the external decision (the carrier folding the decree) happens very quickly and with minimal resistance, softening the sense of hard-won victory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are major strengths: the Lumen Gate as “the town’s ear,” cobblestones as frozen river, kiln and fountain as chiming bodies all create a tactile, acoustic world. Environmental details are not postcard decoration; they’re the medium of action and the mechanism of change. The rules of this quasi-magical acoustic town are consistent and learned by watching Sava work rather than through exposition. The only ceiling here is that we stay tightly on one street, so the larger world’s specificity (mines, governor) remains more schematic than embodied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the town is abandoned or can reassert its aliveness—is clear early and threads through the piece. Pressure escalates as Sava moves from solitary pacing with dogs to orchestrating a whole procession under the gate on the decree day. His agency clearly drives the turns, and there is a visible cost in bodily endurance and communal grief being forced into alignment. That said, the opposition (the governor’s will, the carrier’s duty, economic collapse) never truly bites on the page, so the climax resolves with less friction than the setup implies.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A rich thematic web emerges organically around shared rhythm, civic “balance,” and the idea that community is something tuned into existence rather than assumed. The line “The interval between your step and mine, so we do not topple alone” elegantly encodes the theme without lapsing into moralizing. The final image of collective footsteps making the town ring alive reweights earlier images of hush and emptiness in a resonant way. Some complexity around the economic and political realities (mines failing, governor’s motives) is hinted rather than developed, keeping the moral terrain relatively gentle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The third-person voice is confidently lyrical, with a distinct acoustic lexicon (“metronomes with tails,” “kiln chimed,” “dry fountain gave a wet note”) that feels unified rather than ornamental. The narrative distance is stable and apt for a quasi-mythic tale, offering enough specificity without breaking the fable-like register. POV is cleanly handled and free of head-hopping; when Mara appears, the voice still feels like a single, coherent storyteller. A few elevated phrasings verge on purple but remain controlled and pattern-consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, images often do double duty (worldbuilding plus theme), and there’s little to no scaffolding or explanatory filler. Figurative language is frequent but thematically unified around sound, balance, and bodies as instruments, which prevents it from feeling like random flourish. The prose moves forward with good momentum despite its lyricism, and syntax remains clear. A handful of metaphors (“black as drowned wood,” “houses would quit sounding like coffins”) are vivid but cluster toward the ornate, nudging against but not crossing into overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The central conceit—tuning a ghost town back to life via communal rhythm and an arch that “hears”—is striking and feels genuinely fresh. The story commits fully to its sound-based metaphysics, following through on the implications (bells as symptoms, streets as throat) rather than treating it as a one-off gimmick. Emotional truth about grief, abandonment, and communal repair is delivered through this unusual frame in a way that would be hard to transpose to a generic setting. The only thing holding it just short of the very top band is that the political resolution remains simple compared to the inventive world logic around it.</comment>
