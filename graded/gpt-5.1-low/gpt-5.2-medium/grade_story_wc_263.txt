<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sel’s motivation—to restore stolen stardust and free the city’s creativity—is clear, consistent, and drives every choice, from the nights of watching meteors to opening the vault. Interiority is particular and embodied (tasting grit on the tongue, hearing pressure instead of words), and the sensory filter feels unique to Sel. However, internal contradiction is minimal; Sel rarely wavers or pays a deep emotional price beyond exhaustion, so the arc feels more steadfast than conflicted. The final endurance under the arch reads as earned but not sharply costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: famine of inspiration → suspicion of siphoned stardust → method of resting and tracing meteors → map/spiral → vault opening and city’s release. The accumulative nights of observation and marks on birch bark build toward a clear closure beat where the vault unlocks and the dust returns, providing a legible before/after. The elders’ role as antagonistic force is mostly conveyed through inferred confession and stored relics rather than direct pressure, which softens the sense of risk. Still, the structure holds under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens with a satisfying, on-page reconfiguration at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway, unwritten calendar, vault, and winter sky are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Sel’s sensibility, giving the world a strong atmospheric signature. Setting elements actively matter: resting under the arch, the stones warming, and the hidden seam into the vault all constrain tactics and enable the climactic act. The astrolabe as a handled object functions almost like micro-setting, charging the final image of Sel resting with it. There’s minimal dead description; nearly every environmental detail either advances the method or mirrors the city’s deprivation/renewal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the city remains creatively starved or reclaims its stardust—is established early and escalates through Sel’s repeated, colder, more pressured nights of tracing meteors. Sel’s agency clearly drives the major turn (aligning the astrolabe with the spiral to open the vault), and there’s a conceptual cost in defying the elders and unleashing unpredictable human creativity. However, antagonistic pressure remains abstract: the elders’ control never manifests as concrete threat, and Sel never faces a real risk of failure or punishment on the page. The tension is felt, but more as solemn ritual than sharp, narrowing danger.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of creativity as a shared, uncontrollable resource versus institutional control emerge organically from the stardust premise and the elders’ “famine of inspiration” framing. The return of stardust unleashing not just art but quarrels and daring plans nicely resists a tidy, purely positive moral, suggesting that true inspiration brings friction as well as beauty. The final image of new meteors writing the city’s “true calendar” in fire reweights the entire symbolic system without overt moralizing. A bit more visible moral ambiguity in Sel or the elders might deepen complexity further, but the thematic resonance is already strong.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is lyrically dense yet controlled, with consistent diction (“shadowed rapture,” “bruise of green fire,” “heavy with memory”) that feels native to Sel’s perception. Psychic distance stays steady; we never slip into information Sel couldn’t have, and the narrative doesn’t over-explain what the images already imply. Rhythmic variation and syntactic flexibility keep the prose from becoming monotonous despite its high figurative density. There is no dialogue, but the internal voice and descriptive stance carry enough personality to feel distinct and intentional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The line-level craft is strong: sentences are information-dense, doing double duty with worldbuilding and emotion, and metaphors are generally precise and non-redundant (“the metal murmured names of stars that had died before any written year”). The rhythm modulates between long, spell-like lines and tighter clauses as pressure or awe rises, sustaining momentum despite a reflective bent. A few phrases flirt with purple but remain coherent and anchored in concrete image, avoiding figurative muddle or scaffolding loops. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and there’s little to no padding or synonym churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements—a city whose calendar is written by the sky, remembered stardust as shared inspiration, an aurora-lit gate as literal and figurative threshold, and an instrument that hears dead stars—is fresh and specific. The method of freeing creativity through resting and tracing meteor paths, rather than a conventional heist or rebellion, feels inventive and consonant with the story’s contemplative tone. The closure beat, with silver dust rising and half-born ideas escaping, is both visually striking and conceptually surprising yet inevitable in hindsight. While some broad themes (art vs control) are familiar, the execution and imagery feel distinctive enough for high-band originality.</comment>
