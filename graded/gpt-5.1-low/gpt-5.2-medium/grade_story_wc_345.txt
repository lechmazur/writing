<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The collective “we” narrator, Mara, Jai, and Serren are all cleanly sketched with distinct functions and motives, and the shift from suspicion to trust in Serren is credibly grounded in the grave/logs sequence. Motivation (survive, repair, reach respite, avoid being used) is clear and drives choices. Interiority remains somewhat high-level—there’s little moment-to-moment, embodied contradiction under pressure—but the emotional arc from wary survivors to committed builders feels earned. The final promise to keep chalk and bell together reads as a believable evolution rather than a pasted-on epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The causal chain is strong: crash → chalk messages → bell/ghost → relay revelation → grave/logs → collective rebuild → departure, with each beat logically motivating the next. The closure is decisive and on-page: they complete the relay, choose to leave for the nebula, and assume Serren’s role of guiding future arrivals, with a clear before/after. Some large events (months of rationing, the full rebuild effort) are summarized rather than scened, but at this length they still maintain coherence and pressure. The inferred drive lens (causal with a lyric surface) holds cleanly through the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The orchard world with levitating rock arches, pear valleys, chalked sidewalks, and the butterfly garden is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through the survivors’ needs. Environment directly constrains choices: the relay well is physically under an arch, thorns snag their work, and the arches are what ultimately “carry” their labor into the stars. The bell and garden act as micro-settings that charge both the ghost’s origin and the final image. World rules (relays in arches, sap turning bitter with moons) feel internally consistent and meaningfully tied to survival rather than decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stakes—finding a way off-world to the nebula of respite and deciding whether to trust a ghost’s guidance—are clear and interwoven. There is a real tightening when doubts about Serren’s motives give way to the grave/logs revelation, transforming the risk calculus of committing to the relay project. The labor and coordination needed to rebuild the relay, plus the existential gamble of stepping through the projected “window,” register as costs, though external danger is largely historical rather than immediate. The escalation is more ethical/communal than peril-driven, but it supports the ending convincingly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Family-as-practice, altruism and sacrifice, and the ethics of legacy are all organically embedded: chalk messages, the bell, and Serren’s wartime choice all reconfigure into a communal ethic the protagonists adopt. The final request to “keep chalk and bell together” and guide future arrivals extends the theme without feeling like a grafted moral. The line “because family was a practice, not a bloodline” edges toward explicit statement, but it’s earned by the narrative particulars and doesn’t tip into sermonizing. The emotional aftereffect is quietly resonant rather than tidy or sentimental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The first-person plural voice is confident and controlled, maintaining a coherent collective perspective without head-hopping into individuated interiority. Diction and rhythm are distinct—phrases like “brambled hope, scratched and snagging” and “star-scented window” signal a specific sensibility rather than generic SF narration. Psychic distance is handled well, zooming from summary of months to precise, charged moments (ringing the bell, watching Serren brighten) without confusion. The modulation at the end into a more luminous register feels earned by events rather than like a tonal lurch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prose is dense but controlled, with most sentences doing double or triple duty in advancing plot, atmosphere, and theme; there’s little to no scaffolding or synonym-churn. Figurative language is vivid yet coherent (orchard thorns echoing emotional snags, arches as bridges and relays), and metaphors generally align with the world’s material logic. Syntax and paragraphing vary in pace to match summary versus key beats, maintaining momentum despite reflective passages. No significant line-level artifacts, redundancies, or clarity issues blunt the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The combination of an orchard planet with floating arches, a chalk-bell ghost who organizes collective engineering toward a hidden “nebula of respite,” and a communal “we” narrator feels strikingly specific. Familiar motifs (post-crash survival, benevolent ghost) are transformed through the relay-well premise and the infrastructure of chalk messages, making the resolution hinge on cooperative rebuilding rather than lone-hero action. The final reconfiguration—survivors becoming future guides in Serren’s mold—lands as a non-obvious but inevitable extension of the setup. Overall, the story reads as a distinctive vision rather than a template variation.</comment>
