<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sava’s longing “to graft herself onto community” is clear and consistently expressed through concrete choices (joining the search, bargaining for kinship knowledge, dedicating the arbor). Her interiority is mostly implied rather than deeply dramatized in contradiction, so we don’t fully feel competing impulses under pressure. Secondary characters (Oren, Ilya, the council) are sketched with just enough specificity to feel real and to apply social pressure. The final request “to be named in its web not as guest but as maker” is well-earned and aligned with her earlier motives.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The structure is cleanly causal: Sava’s desire for belonging leads her to the search, which leads to the arbor discovery, which prompts the reinterpretation of the tag and her decision to remake the kin web. Closure is strong via a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: belonging becomes an active craft, and the tag’s meaning shifts from pure safety-marker to invitation. The cost is emotional and social (risking asking to be woven in, reconfiguring inherited customs) and is legible on the page. Escalation is modest but coherent, with the winter/ice-sheet risk and the lost child’s memory adding quiet pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard, crater shimmer, and obsidian arbor are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Sava’s sensibility as a reed sculptor. Environment repeatedly shapes meaning and options: the dangerous ice-sheets motivate the search; the crater shimmer and obsidian arbor charge the kinship revelation; the final winter ice and tag on reeds reweight the entire landscape as a network of connection. Details like crystal fruit ringing and craterlight as “a wound trying to heal” serve both atmosphere and theme without feeling like static postcard description. Spatial and world rules remain coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stakes—Sava’s quest for belonging and the community’s need for safe paths over lethal ice—are clearly signaled and intertwined. Pressure does increase (days of fruitless searching, the council’s expectation of practical directions, the surprise of the arbor and kin-map), culminating in Sava’s choice to transform the invitation into a new social structure. However, conflict remains relatively gentle: there is little overt resistance, and the danger of the ice is remembered rather than directly tested on the page. The final cost is more conceptual and emotional than viscerally dramatized, which slightly softens the sense of escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of chosen kinship, memorial, and belonging-as-craft emerge organically from events, images, and worldbuilding (kin lines slate, reed lattice, loop-and-thorn as invitation). The transformation of the tag’s meaning and Sava’s dedication of the arbor offer a resonant, non-didactic answer to the central question of how communities might make room for the unclaimed and the dead. Lines like “all signs were mortal and that was why people had to return to one another” sit close to explicit thesis but are grounded enough in character and scene to avoid sermonizing. The closing image of the community following the tag “to one another, not away” effectively reweights everything before it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The third-person limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and closely aligned with Sava’s perceptual biases (attention to reeds, lattices, impressions). Diction and rhythm are controlled and distinctive without sliding into opacity, and sparse dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, distinguishing Ilya’s teasing practicality from the council’s clipped formality. Psychic distance is managed smoothly: the narration can zoom to conceptual statements but remains anchored in concrete perception. There is no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge beyond Sava’s plausible inferences.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is polished and musical, with high information density: most sentences do double duty for worldbuilding and emotional tone. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically unified (crystal, wounds, webs, water/light), rarely tipping into muddle or redundancy. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, and there are no obvious scaffold sentences, paraphrase loops, or technical errors that drag momentum. The main limitation is a near-uniform lyric register that very slightly blunts dynamic contrast in higher-pressure moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements—crystalline orchard, crater shimmer, street-artist kinship tag, map-singing, reed lattices as social infrastructure—feels genuinely fresh and organic. While the outsider-finds-belonging arc is familiar, it’s transformed by the specific world logic of crafted kin webs and an anonymous artist designing invitations into community. The obsidian arbor and loop-and-thorn reinterpretation are particularly inventive turns that feel inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth matches the conceptual originality, giving the piece a singular, memorable flavor.</comment>
