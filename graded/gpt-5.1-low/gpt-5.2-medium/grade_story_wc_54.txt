<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lina is sharply etched as a competent, functionally creative engineer whose quiet rule-bending (pocketing the sextant piece, ignoring the radio) feels consistent and motivating. Her interiority is mostly shown through perception and action rather than label-speak, which suits the stoic tone. However, internal contradiction (duty vs. rebellion, career risk vs. hope) remains more implied than dramatized in the moment of choice. Embodied emotion is present but relatively light, so the cost of her choices is more conceptual than felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal spine is clean: discovery of the sextant → discovery of the water system → experiment with redirected flows → power restoration → architectural revelation → antenna beacon. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the accumulative build to the final conceptual repricing (“hope is conserved when it is redirected”) holds together. Closure lands via a clear before/after in the terminal’s state and Lina’s understanding, though the professional and personal costs of defying the demolition brief are underplayed. The piece reads as a tight lyric-leaning causal story with one coherent arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is vividly realized with purposeful detail: dust-filmed glass, sugar-and-grease smells, mechanical rooms, cistern, turbine, and antenna all matter to the plot. The environment directly constrains tactics—her ability to route rainwater and repurpose emergency systems arises from this specific architecture. Carnival residue (confetti, glitter in drains) deftly ties past use to present function. The final image of revived lamps reflecting like a constellation shows the setting charging the thematic closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the terminal will be treated as a dead structure for demolition or a living system that can be reanimated—is clear and Lina’s agency drives the key turns. Escalation exists in the technical challenge (priming pumps, waking lights, then the antenna) and in her deepening understanding of the building’s intentions. However, opposition is mostly ambient (cold, abandonment, implied demolition orders) rather than actively pressing back, so tension is more contemplative than urgent. Costs and foreclosed options are present but subtle, keeping the conflict strong but not searing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Water flows, human flows, the sextant, and the “maze of intentions” interlock into a coherent thematic net about rechanneling grief and hope rather than erasing it. The explorer’s broken sextant and the architect’s diagrams elegantly dramatize the idea that systems are personal and that future hope depends on reworking inherited absences. The final turn—rerouting power to send a beacon—is thematically apt and resonant. The explicit statement “hope is conserved when it is redirected,” while not fatal, edges into on-the-nose moralizing and slightly flattens what the images have already earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The third-person voice is controlled, specific, and colored by Lina’s engineer’s sensibility (“load paths and human paths,” “flow diagrams that treated people like water”). Diction and rhythm are lyrical but not incongruent with her profession, giving the piece a distinct, confident texture. Psychic distance stays stable, with reflections anchored in immediate stimuli (the sextant, diagrams, pumps). There is no head-hopping or register drift that breaks the spell.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is dense yet efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“the building held them like stale air in sealed ducts,” “the first trickle…sounded like a small animal returning to a burrow”). Figurative language is generally fresh and coherent, and rhythm varies well across descriptive and action beats. There is little scaffolding or redundancy; exposition is woven into tactile action (reading diagrams while planning flows). At a demanding-editor level, a few metaphors push toward richness-for-its-own-sake, but they do not obscure meaning or dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The combination of a derelict spaceport, hydrological engineering, and a broken sextant tying architecture to navigation feels genuinely fresh. Treating people and grief as flows within infrastructural systems is a non-obvious but organic thematic frame. The resurrection of the terminal via redirected emergency systems to send a quiet beacon is an inventive, understated climax. While not radically experimental in structure, the piece’s conceptual synthesis and object work stand out in a crowded field.</comment>
