<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrator’s desire to understand buildings and to save the Dovetail is consistent and drives every choice, and Ilyas’s role as tutor/neighbor is sharply etched in a few strokes. The bond with the grandmother via Phoenician and the sugar/tea backstory gives their relationship depth without overexplaining. Internal contradiction is relatively light; the narrator’s fear and moral qualms about deceit are implied rather than dramatized in a way that might have added further complexity. Ilyas’s final fading feels emotionally earned but could land harder if the narrator’s attachment and cost were more explicitly conflicted in the final beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation is excellent: roof, building, imminent inspection, and stakes are all clear very early. The causal chain is strong and clean—seal → building language → hidden cavity → documents → planted evidence → preservation order → Ilyas’s disappearance. Closure lands with both an external decisive change (heritage protection) and an internal reconfiguration (the building “settles,” Ilyas’s purpose is fulfilled), with a faint but legible cost in his loss. The inspector scene resolves surprisingly smoothly, muting some sense of risk or resistance that could have intensified the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The rooftop garden, meteors, parapet carvings, and the building’s interior all feel tactile and specific, with details like tremoring herb pots and steam-script that carry mood and worldbuilding simultaneously. Setting is not mere backdrop: clay from the planters and the parapet marks are functional tools that enable communication with the building and discovery of the cavity. The meteor shower and rooftop recur to charge both the wax/clay scene and the final image, deepening the sense of cosmic yet intimate change. A slight bias toward the visual over other senses keeps this just shy of perfection but does not impede clarity or effect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—saving the Dovetail from demolition—is clear from early on, and the pressure coherently narrows options toward the inspector’s walk-through. The key escalation is the discovery of the hidden documents and the choice to deploy a “single shared lie” by planting them, which nicely entwines internal ethics with external risk. However, conflict with the inspector and landlord remains largely off-page or frictionless; the walk-through itself feels almost too easy, with minimal resistance or complication. As a result, the price paid is more conceptual and emotional than viscerally felt, limiting the sense of sharp escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of language, preservation, and the ethics of “agreed upon lies” emerge organically through building-whispers, the dead language tutor, and the concealment/revelation of the Dovetail’s history. The story deftly suggests that lies can be in service of deeper truths and that buildings themselves “speak” through time and material, without ever lapsing into overt moralizing. The final image of Ilyas fading “like a word finally understood” reweights the entire narrative as one about translation and remembrance rather than mere paperwork victory. A bit more tension around the moral ambiguity of forging/planting documents could deepen the thematic bite even further.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual style (“meteors stitched white seams across the dark,” “steam were a script”) that feels true to someone obsessed with language and buildings. POV is clean and stable, with no head-hopping and a controlled mix of present action and compressed backstory. The modulation from wonder on the roof to careful manipulation during the inspection, then back to quiet, uncanny intimacy, is smooth and tonally coherent. The high-register diction occasionally risks feeling a touch self-conscious, but it remains within the believable lexicon of this narrator.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line by line, the prose is polished, compressed, and imagistically rich, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and information (“meteors stitched white seams…like the sky was being repaired”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled; images rarely clash, and rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. There is minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and the narrative flows cleanly from beat to beat without syntactic confusion. At times the density of metaphor approaches purple, which slightly risks overshadowing emotional immediacy, but it never seriously obscures sense or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The combination of a ghostly dead-language tutor, a building whose cracks form sentences, a hereditary seal, and lies-as-temporary-scaffolding for truth feels genuinely fresh and well integrated. The story reimagines familiar haunted-building and preservation tropes through the lens of linguistics and translation, rather than horror or nostalgia alone. The dead tutor teaching the granddaughter to “speak” to the building through clay and seal is especially inventive and thematically tight. It stops just short of astonishing only because the central conflict with bureaucratic forces stays relatively straightforward and could be further complicated for even greater originality.</comment>
