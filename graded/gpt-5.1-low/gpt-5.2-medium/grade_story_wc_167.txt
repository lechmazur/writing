<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ilya’s motives—protecting ordinary, working light against erasure—are specific, consistent, and expressed through concrete professional habits (the glazier’s satchel, the choice of plain harbor glass). His nocturnal pond ritual adds idiosyncratic depth rather than generic “brooding.” Internal contradiction is mild (he feels powerless yet keeps acting), and the inspector’s shift is credible but a touch quick, leaving limited room for messier resistance or flaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: notice → nocturnal reckoning at the pond → dawn repair → conversation in the atrium → revised recommendation, with the pond method reprised to frame the ethical choice. Closure is a decisive change with conceptual cost: the demolition is averted in favor of a public workshop, explicitly at odds with the luxury marina plan. The main structural limitation is how readily one inspector’s awakening seems to overturn entrenched economic pressure, which slightly softens the felt difficulty of the win.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The harbor, prism atrium, mist, and lily pond are richly particular and always filtered through Ilya’s eye for light and surfaces, avoiding “tourist catalog” description. Setting is not mere backdrop: the glass roof, fog, and repaired pane literally shape what the inspector sees; the pond’s ripples physically embody the competing futures of efficiency vs motion. This environment decisively charges the final images, though the realism of the broader city politics beyond this pocket of setting is left largely offstage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the atrium and bayfront become a luxury marina or remain a public, working light—is clear and present early via the posted notice. Pressure escalates through the nocturnal failure to find certainty, then tightens at the on-site inspection where Ilya must pivot from craftsmanship to persuasion. The conflict resolves through his choices (repairing with plain glass, reframing the checklist, using the pond demonstration), but the inspector’s resistance melts somewhat quickly, keeping the moral calculus sharp but the interpersonal struggle relatively gentle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of valuing the “smallest lights,” resisting efficiency that erases motion, and honoring ordinary labor emerge organically through the pane choice, the harbor routine, and the ripple imagery. The pond’s interference patterns and the contrast of prism vs harbor glass offer a non-literal answer to “what is a place worth if its smallest lights are replaced?” The only drag is an occasional tilt toward explicit statement (e.g., directly naming “efficiency” and the luxury marina), which edges close to telling the thesis rather than leaving it fully in subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The third-person-limited voice is stable, confident, and tightly keyed to a glazier’s way of noticing—light, surfaces, lattices, and reflections. Syntax and diction are lyrically elevated but internally consistent, with phrases like “noctilucent reckonings” and “silent arithmetic” feeling like natural extensions of Ilya’s sensibility rather than add-on ornament. Dialogue, though brief, reads plausibly and carries subtext (the inspector moving from rote numbers to moral concession) without expository stiffness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prose is dense yet controlled, with most sentences doing double duty—advancing physical situation while carrying image or theme (e.g., droplets turning sunrise into “scattered, disciplined colors”). Metaphoric threads (glass, light, ripples) are coherent rather than mixed, and repetition is patterned rather than looped. A few abstractions (“clear complexity,” “silent arithmetic”) slightly risk over-lyricism, but they don’t obscure sense or blunt the closing image, so momentum and clarity remain strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The combination of a harbor glazier protagonist, a shuttered prism atrium, and a quasi-divinatory reading of pond ripples as ethical calculus feels strikingly fresh. Common material—gentrification, public vs luxury development—is reworked through tactile craft detail and luminous, technical imagery instead of familiar protest tropes. The risk of high-density lyricism mostly pays off, producing a distinctive and memorable aesthetic rather than a generic “save the old place” story.</comment>
