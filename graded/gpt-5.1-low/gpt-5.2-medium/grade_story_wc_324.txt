<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s vocation, personal history, and present choices interlock cleanly: her professional calm strains against the reawakened trauma of recognizing the photograph, yet she still chooses to intervene in a way consistent with her ethos (“incidental heroism…looked like showing up at the right breath”). Her interiority is specific and embodied (throat “full of ash,” the hearing aid warming at the end) rather than generic. Eli, though less developed, feels real, with his vulnerability and the way he latches onto the photograph and the voice. The final endurance—continuing to bear her own grief in order to protect others—is credibly earned and carries a visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight: the photograph → recognition and hearing-aid pulse → following the signal → finding Eli and the suicidal call → reframing the connection → release. Structure is cleanly single-scene with minor spatial shifts that are always anchored, and each step follows logically from the last. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: grief’s chain is interrupted, Mara’s past is recontextualized via the “PLEASE” addition, and the final image makes a before/after legible. No significant orientation or lens ambiguity undermines the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The hospital, mist-clad atrium, fogged windows, and stairwell are economically but vividly drawn, always filtered through Mara’s waiting and tension. The hearing aid functions as a micro-setting/tool that constrains action and attention, and the final image under fern shadows with the warm aid meaningfully charges the environment. Weather and twilight support the tone without feeling like clichés, especially because “when the dead call” is tied to this liminal time. The setting mostly shapes mood and perception rather than concrete physical options, but it’s integral to the story’s feel and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing Eli from obeying the suicidal dead voice, and more broadly disrupting the spread of weaponized grief—is clear and escalates naturally from eerie call to immediate life-or-death pressure. The key tightening comes when the hearing aid flares with four pulses and Mara realizes the caller is her own mother’s grief looping through others, linking Eli’s crisis directly to her past. Mara’s tactic choice (sitting beside him, talking to the chain instead of wrestling the phone away) arises from her philosophy and entails emotional risk. The resolution is earned, with the cost embedded in her willingness to reopen and narrate her trauma to alter the pattern.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of grief as contagious, the limits of the dead (who “can only repeat what they died believing”), and the living’s power to revise inherited messages are woven through concrete images and actions rather than abstract statement. The photograph’s shift from “STAY” to “STAY, PLEASE” and the notion that wanting silence doesn’t require surrender give nuanced, non-didactic answers to the story’s implicit question about how to live with insistent loss. Subtext around incidental heroism and the ethics of listening operates in gesture and choice, especially Mara’s decision to trace connections instead of exorcising the voice. The ending’s focus on Mara’s “stubborn, curious life” reweights the whole piece without tipping into moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled yet clear, with consistent diction that fits Mara’s reflective, observant temperament. Sentences have varied rhythm, and repeated phrasings (“reeling hush,” “incidental heroism”) feel like deliberate motifs, not tics. Dialogue is sparse but natural and purposeful, and the dead woman’s calm, insidious cadence contrasts effectively with Mara’s grounded responses. Psychic distance is well-managed, sliding closer at peak moments (recognizing the photograph, hearing-aid flares) without head-hopping or explanatory overreach.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and plot) and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. Imagery (the hearing aid’s “faint electrical stutters,” static that “sounded almost like relief”) is precise and thematically charged without becoming purple. Syntax and paragraphing maintain momentum through the central confrontation, and the final sentence elegantly knots image, theme, and character. Any minor repetition feels pattern-driven rather than accidental and does not blunt the closing cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise of a “contact tracer for hearts” using a retro hearing aid to track grief-voices is striking and feels organic to the character rather than gimmicky. The story re-inflects familiar ghost-contact and suicide-intervention tropes through specific, fresh mechanics (electrical pulses, contagion metaphor) and a gentle but firm focus on incidental heroism. The twist that the caller is her mother’s grief diffused through others is both conceptually inventive and emotionally grounded. The final conceptual repositioning—that the living can revise what the dead repeat—offers a non-obvious yet inevitable-feeling synthesis.</comment>
