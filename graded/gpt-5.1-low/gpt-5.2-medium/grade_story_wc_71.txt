<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is precise, idiosyncratic, and consistently tied to how she notices and orders the world, and her core motive (understanding why some houses feel alive) cleanly drives her choices. The shard amplifies, rather than replaces, her existing sensitivity, so her actions feel character-rooted rather than magical-default. Her final renunciation of the shard is motivated and carries a quiet cost: she gives up a unique tool to let its benefits diffuse. The only limit, at this length, is that her internal contradictions (e.g., desire to keep the hush vs. share it) are present but not deeply dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The structure is accumulative and clean: discovery of the shard → experiments with object placement in Alderwick → expanded practice in other homes → communal test during the blackout → renunciation at the tide line. Causality is legible under a textural lens; each “because” is an intensification of the same drive (to restore aliveness) through increasingly public stakes. Closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing: aliveness is redefined as attention and arrangement, and Mara writes a new rule that forecloses casual displacement for herself. The cost—releasing the shard and accepting that power must be diffused into the city rather than hoarded—is understated but on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The quiet bay, streetlights, tide line, and empty houses are vivid and filtered through Mara’s sensibility; they never feel like generic scenery. The orris shard and house interiors function as micro-settings that constrain her tactics (she can only sense and “sanctify” by moving through specific rooms and objects), and the storm/blackout forces the pivotal communal gathering into the Alderwick House. World rules around “aliveness” remain consistent and are learned through her experiments rather than exposition. The final image at the tide line, with hush spreading “like cool fragrance” over the street, is inseparable from this spatial and atmospheric groundwork.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether and how attention can make spaces truly “alive”—is clear and tightened by Mara’s experiments and the storm that tests her theory at social scale. Escalation is mostly conceptual and textural rather than confrontational: she moves from solitary cataloger to quasi-ritual leader during the blackout, then chooses to relinquish the shard. That choice entails a real trade-off (personal power vs. distributed belonging), but external opposition is minimal and events mostly accommodate her goals. As a result, pressure feels finely wrought but a shade gentler than elite-level conflict could sustain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of attention, belonging, and the ethics of “displacement” are woven tightly into objects and actions: cataloging, rehoming items, and the idea that “every misplaced object is a missing word.” The story’s answer—that aliveness is a conversation of belongings and the care with which they’re moved—emerges organically from Mara’s behavior and the community’s restoration of the house. A few lines (“A house lives when it can recognize itself”; the explicit margin rule) edge toward thesis-stating, softening some of the subtlety. Still, the final image of a city burning “quietly with belonging” has genuine conceptual and emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is lyrically precise and confidently controlled, with metaphors (“streetlights daydream,” “kindling for a fire that made no smoke”) that feel both surprising and internally coherent. POV is stably close-third around Mara, with no head-hopping and a clear perceptual signature rooted in how she notices tiny shifts and displaced objects. Rhythm modulates well between long, lush sentences and tighter, declarative turns at key insights. The voice remains consistent even as stakes broaden to the community, which helps the conceptual material feel grounded rather than abstract.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is dense but highly efficient, with most sentences doing double duty for image and idea; there’s very little scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent, yet metaphors are largely coherent with the world of scent, quiet, and domestic space, avoiding muddle even in peak beats. Momentum holds despite lyric richness, in part because transitions (e.g., from solo experiments to the blackout gathering) are compressed but clear. The only minor limitation for top-tier is that imagery is almost uniformly lush, with few deliberately plain lines to vary texture and let the heaviest moments breathe.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The fusion of estate cataloging, perfumery, and a literal “shard of hush” as a way to explore how homes feel alive is strikingly original, and the story follows its implications with integrity. Using displaced objects as both magical mechanism and thematic engine feels non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. The risks—highly metaphorical conceit, quiet stakes, heavy lyricism—pay off because they all serve the same question of attention and belonging. This combination of concept, voice, and closure would be hard to transplant to another setting or character without losing its core power.</comment>
