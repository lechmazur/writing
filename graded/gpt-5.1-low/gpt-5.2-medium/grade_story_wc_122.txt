<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s characterization is vivid and specific—a deaf teacher who “read[s] music in faces and floors” and recognizes silence as having weight—and her competence informs the tactics she chooses in the cavern. Her motivation to counter numbness is clear, and her actions consistently arise from that sensitivity to vibration and emotional absence. What’s missing for a higher score is a sharper on-page contradiction or inner cost at the climax; she solves the problem without much visible internal struggle or moral friction. The relationship with Kerrin functions more as collaboration than a pressured crucible, which keeps emotional complexity just shy of top-tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal chain is coherent and tight: strange drums → broken needle → filament of hush → backward play and scoring of the record → snapping of the parasite and restoration of feeling. The story stays in one scene with clean spatial and temporal continuity, and the closure beat (the filament snapping, the Listener withdrawing, and Mara carrying a new lesson out of the cavern) is unambiguous and earned. The drive lens is primarily causal with some textural layering, and the Decisive Change is clear: the world’s emotional state shifts. The only restraint on a higher score is that the solution arrives relatively smoothly once explained, with little sense that alternative options were seriously weighed or foreclosed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cavern, the quarry path, and the tactile soundscape filtered through a deaf protagonist create a highly specific, atmospheric setting where environment and tools (drums, phonograph, stone walls) directly constrain tactics. Mara’s habit of feeling vibrations in the floor and on the wall is both worldbuilding and mechanism for sensing the thinning hush, making the setting integral rather than decorative. The Listener as a cave-dwelling “keeper” deepens place-based mythology in a way that feeds the stakes. This is just shy of the very top band because the broader world (town, school) remains mostly gestural rather than texturally present.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—overcoming a parasitic numbness affecting Mara and the town—is established early and escalates as the cavern’s hush reveals itself as an active, consuming force. Mara’s choice to reverse the record and to score it with the broken needle is a clear tightening: she actively risks intensifying the disturbance to unwind it, and the Listener’s reaction marks a credible peak. However, the conflict resolves without much visible cost beyond strain and momentary numbness; no option feels truly dangerous or mutually exclusive. The tension is steady and compelling but never quite reaches a knife-edge trade-off that would push this into the highest band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Thematic threads—silence as weight, numbness as parasite, the idea of “playing the song backward” to move hearts forward—are well woven through concrete actions (touching stone, scoring grooves) rather than abstract exposition. The final lesson about keeping movement until hearts remember forward is resonant and rooted in Mara’s experience as both teacher and survivor of silence. That last sentence edges toward aphorism, which slightly flattens the complexity the story has otherwise earned. Overall, the piece tackles grief, disconnection, and the labor of restoring feeling with genuine subtlety, but the ending leans a touch too close to stated wisdom for elite-tier nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The third-person-limited voice through Mara is controlled and distinctive, with attention tuned to vibrations, pressure, and embodied perception rather than to sound—a strong perceptual signature. Syntax and rhythm are varied and musical, fitting the subject matter without slipping into self-conscious ornament. There’s no head-hopping; even Kerrin’s experience is relayed in a way consistent with what Mara can learn or infer. Occasionally the diction (“parasite of feeling,” “careful gardener”) feels slightly more authorial than character-filtered, but it doesn’t break POV or clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The line-level craft is polished: sentences pull multiple weights (worldbuilding, mood, and action), and there’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is rich but generally coherent (“vibrations skitter like startled mice”; “filament of hush”) and supports rather than obscures events. The prose occasionally edges toward density, with several metaphor-laden clauses in sequence, which risks slowing momentum in a high-pressure beat. Still, clarity holds throughout, and the final image lands cleanly without textual clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The blend of a deaf music teacher, a drum-maker’s cavern, an antique phonograph, and a literalized “filament of hush” as an emotional parasite is strikingly fresh, and the backward-record solution feels like an organic extension of the premise rather than a gimmick. The Listener as a pale, glassy-eyed “gardener” of numbness is an inventive embodiment of a psychological state. The story commits to its conceit and follows through to a reweighted final lesson that is thematically and imaginatively coherent. It doesn’t quite reach the rarefied band where every move feels surprising yet inevitable, but it is notably above-average in originality and integration.</comment>
