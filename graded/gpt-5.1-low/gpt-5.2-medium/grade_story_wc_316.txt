<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrator’s numb clarity, puppet-like self-perception, and desire to “vivify what the rewrites had dulled” create a specific, contradictory psychology that feels credible under this surreal premise. The cost of that clarity—seeing through both factions’ motives yet feeling like an “empty drum”—grounds the final choice to reject both ownership claims. Some moments lean on abstract labeling (“emotional numbness,” “post ego death sight”) rather than fully embodied emotion, which slightly blunts the peak beats. Overall, the interior arc from detached witness to co-guardian is well motivated and earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The situational spine is clean: Custodians arrive, demand a trial, the protagonist must choose how to respond, culminating in a reconfigured custody arrangement. Causality holds, and the closure—shifting from legal ownership to mutual guardianship—lands as a Conceptual Repricing with emotional cost (the crack in numbness, the abandonment of being “the” original). However, the factions’ capitulation to the protagonist’s method feels somewhat compressed and low-friction, with systemic change arriving quickly once they are made to “breathe together.” The drive lens reads as Situational/Accumulative and is coherent, but one more concrete resistance beat would deepen the cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo above an ash-colored sea, gravity ropes, wind bells with two tones, and the edge over cloud create a striking, cohesive atmosphere that feels integral rather than decorative. The setting supports the thematic focus on balance and precariousness, and staging the trial at the dojo’s edge subtly raises stakes. The world-rule of history rewriting is clearly signaled and reappears as “history flickered,” though it remains more conceptual pressure than a concrete constraint on tactics. Overall, setting is vivid, purposeful, and tightly fused to mood and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The central stakes—who counts as the “real” person and what happens to the clone body and jar-brain—are clearly established, and the demand for a trial on the dojo edge provides a solid external pressure that echoes the internal battle with numbness. Escalation comes from moving from argument to embodied test, and from mere survival of ego-death to redefining personhood as co-guardianship. Yet the conflict resolution leans toward harmony, with limited on-page resistance once the protagonist initiates the push-pull technique; the cost is more internal and conceptual than sharply dramatized in the factions’ behavior. The pressure is coherent and meaningful but could benefit from a more tangible sacrifice or loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Themes of personhood, ownership, and the necessity of complementary opposites (grief/gratitude, stillness/strike, law/art) are intricately woven through setting, conflict, and character choices. The final move—declaring “custody of the moment” and becoming co-guardians—reweights the entire custody battle in a resonant way that fits the premise. However, several thematic statements are spelled out in thesis-like language (“the only custody worth fighting for was custody of the moment”; “attention given without ownership”), edging toward overt moralizing rather than fully trusting image and action. The subtext is strong, but a lighter touch on explicit articulation would lift it into a higher band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that marries metaphysical concepts to tactile images (wind bells ringing “in two tones at once,” “braided gravity ropes”). Narrative distance is stable and apt, allowing reflection without losing immediacy, and the occasional dialogue snippets are embedded cleanly. Elevated diction suits the speculative-philosophical frame and rarely feels out of step with the narrator’s implied education and experience. There are a few abstract phrasings that skim toward essayistic, but they do not materially disrupt the voice’s integrity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is dense but generally precise, achieving high information-per-sentence with minimal redundancy; images like “a well trained puppet” and “my chest felt like an empty drum” are vivid and efficient. Rhythm varies well across long, flowing sentences and sharper, declarative lines at key turns, keeping momentum through a complex concept-load. Now and then, figurative and abstract language stack (“vivify what the rewrites had dulled,” “the dojo art that slices through pretense”) in ways that feel slightly ornamental rather than strictly necessary. Overall, line-level craft is strong and clear, with only light tightening needed for peak-pressure economy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a floating rock dojo, legalistic Custodians, a brain-in-jar clone custody battle, and the metaphysical conceit of history constantly rewriting itself is strikingly original yet thematically coherent. Using martial-arts philosophy of complementary opposites as the method for resolving a legal and ontological dispute feels fresh and non-obvious. The final reconfiguration—co-guardianship achieved through attention without ownership—offers a distinctive answer to the clone/original trope. Minor familiarity in some thematic phrasing is outweighed by the uniqueness of the world and the conceptual integration.</comment>
