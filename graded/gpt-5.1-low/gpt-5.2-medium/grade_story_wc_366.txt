<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Noah’s reticence, competence, and quietly protective streak are established from the first line and drive every later choice, especially taking the sea glass and ultimately writing his own anonymous letter. His interiority—“he had never been good at saying what mattered, yet he carried the sea glass”—is concrete and particular rather than generic. The dynamic with Maris is subtle but legible in status and care without explicit statements. The final renunciation of signature reads as an earned extension of his flaw and value system rather than an easy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: lamp failure → discovery of the letter and cairn code → interim protection via stones → physical repair of the light, all under the constraints of fog and dead radio. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Noah joins the anonymous chain and restores the beam, with the cost in labor and vulnerability clearly on the page. Time and space remain coherent and anchored, with no orientation debt. The single-scene arc fits the length and stakes, with no unkept setups or convenience fixes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse, fog, “haunted” lantern room, and shoreline are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Noah’s professional eye and superstition-aware pragmatism. Setting directly constrains tactics—dead mast and weak skiff lamp make cairns and physical repair necessary rather than decorative. The lens, sea glass, and stones recur as charged objects that shape choice and charge the final image. Weather and sea conditions matter to action (trawler’s horn, reef avoidance), not just mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing disaster in the sea lanes and protecting Maris and unnamed sailors—is clear early and tightens as the night stretches on without the beacon. Escalation is primarily accumulative: from eerie failure through improvised cairn signaling to the hands-on, risky repair of the lamp. The cost (bleeding fingers, exhaustion, emotional strain) is present but understated, fitting the piece’s quiet mode. If anything, the physical difficulty of restoring the light resolves a bit smoothly, but not enough to undercut the felt pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: anonymous care, inherited watchfulness, and the attempt to “bottle the feeling of safety” through letters, glass, and light. The sea glass and cairns evolve from curiosities into embodiments of fear transformed, without overt moralizing. The final image of the beam as a “bottled safety warming in the dark” reweights everything before it without flattening complexity. Ambiguity about haunting and duty lingers productively rather than confusingly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The close-third voice is consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature that mixes working knowledge (“skiff,” “filament”) and lyrical metaphor in a way that feels like Noah’s compressed thought rather than authorial intrusion. POV control is clean; we never slip into Maris’s interiority, yet her state is visible through observed detail. Rhythm modulates well with pressure—longer, more sinuous sentences for atmosphere, slightly tighter ones under action—without monotony. A few phrases push toward the lyrical edge, but they maintain clarity and coherence with the established register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple jobs (atmosphere, character, stakes) with minimal scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent; metaphors like “a lighthouse in darkness had a different sound, like a throat refusing to sing” are vivid and precise. There’s little to no synonym churn, template cadence, or explanatory redundancy slowing momentum. The closing paragraphs, in particular, balance clarity of action with charged imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A lighthouse-haunting premise is familiar, but the anonymous letter chain, sea-glass token, and stone-cairn grammar inflect it in a fresh, character-grounded way. The notion of inherited, anonymous safety work—bottled and passed on—feels specific rather than generic, particularly in how it ties to Noah’s childhood storm-closet memory. The story commits fully to its quiet, accumulative design without retreating to twistiness or cliché. Most beats would be hard to transplant into another setting without losing their force, which speaks to its conceptual integrity.</comment>
