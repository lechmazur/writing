<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lena’s motivation and sensibility are clear and specific—the “brightly attentive” archivist whose ethics compel her to act. Her choices (investigate, test Harke, whistleblow) track cleanly with that characterization. What’s missing at this level is a sharper sense of internal contradiction or cost—she rarely hesitates or feels truly torn. The result is strong but somewhat linear characterization rather than something fully layered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: pattern noticed → profiles discovered → confrontation with Harke → deeper digging → whistleblowing. The structure fits the length, with one main tightening when she realizes the profiles link to missing persons and a secret site. Closure lands as a conceptual and practical turn when she presses send and reinterprets 7-22 as a count. The only limitation is that consequences remain mostly implied rather than structurally tested on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The archive is vividly realized as both physical space and sonic/psychic environment (“hummed in frequencies,” “beneath the Chicago headquarters”). Details are selective, filtered through Lena’s expertise, and avoid touristic listing. The recurring hum and the server partitions directly charge the closing image of “forty-three ghosts” and the archive’s expectant silence. This integration of setting with theme and ending is strong enough for high-band, though one more concrete constraint on action from the environment could push it higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The core stake—exposing a corporate cover-up tied to vanished people—is clear and escalates as Lena moves from odd numbers to a conspiracy. Harke’s lie provides a useful pressure bump that forces her into covert action. However, opposition stays largely soft and offstage; we never feel concrete risk or a loss that alters her tactics. The piece has solid tension for its length, but the conflict never quite sharpens into a moment of true danger or sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of memory, erasure, and corporate control of narrative emerge organically from the archive work and Lena’s role as “Memory Keeper.” The final reframing of 7-22 from code to count, and of data as what “remembers what the corporation wanted to forget,” offers earned conceptual depth. The story avoids explicit moralizing while clearly indicting institutional forgetting. A bit more ambiguity around Lena’s complicity or risk could deepen the thematic complexity further.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The close third-person POV is steady and well-controlled, with a distinct, slightly lyrical corporate-tech idiom that feels suited to Lena. Metaphors about data and memory sound like they come from her mind rather than an abstract narrator. There’s no head-hopping or awkward distance shifts, and exposition is mostly folded into voice rather than bolted on. The register edges toward elevated at times but remains coherent with the character and world.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and plot. Imagery around data, songs, and ghosts is consistent without tipping into purple excess or repetition. There are no noticeable scaffold loops or mechanical cadences, and the opening and closing lines are particularly strong. A touch more variation in figurative approach—beyond the memory/ghost frame—might prevent slight motif saturation, but it doesn’t hinder clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The blend of social media archiving, corporate consolidation, and a missing-persons conspiracy via “undeleted” profiles feels fresh. Using recurring numbers as the archive’s “language” and reweighting them as a body count is an elegant twist on a familiar pattern-mystery trope. The whistleblower arc and evil megacorp elements are more conventional, keeping it just shy of truly standout originality. Still, the specific angle and execution show clear ingenuity.</comment>
