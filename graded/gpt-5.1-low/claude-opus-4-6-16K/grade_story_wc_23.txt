<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren’s grief, competence, and stubbornness are specific and embodied (“patchwork navigator,” the censer foot as last touch), and her actions clearly flow from that mix. The internal contradiction—needing proof without getting rescue—is implied rather than spelled out, which works well at this length. Her final stance (accepting the signal as non-resolution yet continuing to listen) feels earned. A secondary tension with any living person is absent, which keeps the crucible fairly narrow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The causal spine is clean: cryptic calls → travel to the decommissioned array → painstaking building → final midnight call → listening and reinterpreting what “finding” could mean. The blend of summarized past weeks and present-tense night works smoothly, with clear spatial and temporal anchors. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the goal shifts from recovery to navigation of an enduring distance, with cost acknowledged on the page. The story is quiet structurally but satisfyingly complete for its scale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Manitoba plateau, frozen dishes, and “stars pressed down like a weight” create a vivid, tonally aligned environment that feels lived-in rather than touristic. The signal station’s remoteness and decommissioned state meaningfully frame Maren’s isolation and choices; she can only work with salvage, alone under that sky. The censer foot functions as a micro-setting object, constraining how she works on the platform and charging the final image. Atmosphere and specificity are rich without becoming cluttered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how Maren will respond to the possibility of contact with her vanished daughter—is clear early and tightens when the coordinates fold back on the station and the caller says “Listen.” Escalation is primarily internal but legible: from building in uncertainty, to receiving a stronger, moon-tied signal, to realizing it offers presence rather than rescue. Her agency manifests in choosing to stay, to listen, and to accept that limited gift, foreclosing fantasies of resolution. The piece could edge higher if a concrete alternative path (e.g., leaving, destroying the rig) were more palpably available at the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of grief, trace, and “reverse migration” emerge organically from the particulars of coordinates, maps, and radio listening rather than overt moralizing. The “geography of loss” idea is strong and the final image—Maren turning slowly toward something she can almost name—reweights earlier material with a quiet, durable resonance. The signal as a map of collective loss conceptually enlarges the story without breaking its intimate frame. A few near-abstract phrases (“geography of loss itself”) brush the edge of stating the thesis but are grounded quickly in image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is confident, consistent, and textured, with sentences that vary rhythm to match reflection versus present action. Diction fits both character and milieu—technical terms like “parabolic” sit comfortably next to more lyrical choices like “savage with stars.” Interior access stays bound to Maren’s perceptions, and exposition passes through her sensibility rather than authorial lecture. There is no dialogue to test, but the narrative voice alone carries strong personality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is lean yet evocative; most sentences do double duty advancing both scene and emotional texture. Metaphors (“sunflowers tracking a dead star,” “geography of loss”) are striking but not overstacked, and they stay coherent with the world’s physics. There’s little to no scaffolding or synonym-churn, and the final lines land cleanly without purple excess. At a rarefied level one might trim a phrase or two of explanatory abstraction, but nothing meaningfully slows momentum or muddies closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fusion of decommissioned radio astronomy, a “patchwork navigator,” reverse human migration, and an almost-mystical signal encoding absence feels fresh and particular rather than templated SF or grief-fiction. The censer foot as both tool and reliquary is an especially memorable stroke. The story takes the risk of a non-rescue ending and commits to it, finding meaning in trace rather than reunion. It stops short of outright formal experimentation, but within a conventional frame it shows a distinct and confident imaginative stance.</comment>
