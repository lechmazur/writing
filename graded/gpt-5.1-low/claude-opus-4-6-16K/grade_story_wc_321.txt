<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara is sharply drawn through concrete habit (“rag that smelled like diesel and optimism”) and the choice to keep working a ghost route, and her agency at the junction (choosing to lead the other Maras) is well motivated by that stubbornness. Her resilient positivity is dramatized rather than merely asserted. The main limitation is that internal contradiction under peak pressure stays muted—she adapts to the grotto and multiverse revelation with almost no visible fear or doubt, which slightly flattens her emotional range.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The causal spine is clean: ferry glitches → clocks deform → descent to the grotto → discovery of the hourglass and star-pattern mechanic → radio-coordinated solution → restored, unified harbor. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost: many possible harbors braided into one, remembered only by Mara, who carries the burden of knowledge and the glowing hourglass. The structure fits the length—a brief set-up of the problem, one surreal descent, one decisive tactic—without loose or unkept set-ups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful from the opening harbor details to the phosphorescent grotto: sensory specifics are strong and filtered through Mara’s working knowledge. The grotto and fractal sky are not postcard imagery; their properties (junction, star intervals, hourglass niche) directly determine how she can act. The hourglass and later the locker become micro-settings that charge the final image with ongoing consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing destructive timeline collisions and preserving the *Perseverance*’s meaningful crossings—is clear and escalates from eerie glitches to existential risk. Pressure tightens once through Mara’s realization that the hourglass is empty and timelines are merging, forcing her into the active role of coordinating the other selves via radio. The main soft spot is that the tactical execution (recognize pattern, have everyone hum, and it works) feels almost too smooth, with little friction or risk of failure once the mechanic is understood.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of persistence, invisible labor, and the quiet sanctity of “showing up” emerge organically from Mara’s job, her refusal to quit, and the way those traits uniquely equip her to save the crossing. The final image of the hourglass “permanent as a heartbeat, transient as a crossing” elegantly reframes the ferry ride as both mundane commute and metaphysical miracle. The only drawback is one slightly explicit thematic sentence (“proof that showing up is its own kind of miracle”) that edges toward stating the moral rather than trusting the images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The third-person close voice is confident, textured, and consistent, with lovely turns of phrase that feel anchored in Mara’s sensibility rather than generic lyricism. Temporal and spatial focalization remain tight and legible even as reality distorts, and the brief use of radio “voices” doesn’t break POV control. Rhythm modulates well between workaday description and the more elevated grotto passages without register clash.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple functions (world, mood, character) with minimal scaffolding, and the prose sustains a lyrical density without tipping into confusion. Metaphors (“clear as held breath,” “rag that smelled like diesel and optimism”) are fresh and coherent, and there’s no noticeable synonym-churn or template cadence. The final paragraphs in particular achieve a strong read-aloud rhythm while remaining clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a blue-collar commuter ferry with multiverse physics, a spectral junction, and a collective self-salvage via radio and star-interval humming feels genuinely fresh and specific. The hourglass and the ethic of routine labor ground what could be abstract SF/F in lived texture and emotional truth. The closure image—world quietly rebraided, miracle unacknowledged by those it saves—delivers a non-obvious but inevitable-feeling resolution to the premise.</comment>
