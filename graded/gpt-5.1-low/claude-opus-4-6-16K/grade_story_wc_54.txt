<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sable’s motivation and temperament are clear, grounded in her engineer’s mindset and attraction to “puzzles,” and her choice to volunteer plus her obsessive proposal work track cleanly from that. The maze-of-intentions reflection gives her a credible, character-specific philosophy. However, internal contradiction under pressure is relatively mild; she rarely feels truly torn or at risk, which keeps her arc from fully sharpening into visible cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: carnival hacks the infrastructure → Sable investigates → she reimagines the system → she produces the proposal → the board grants a feasibility study. The time-compression (“over the following weeks”) is efficient and doesn’t blur stakes, and closure lands as a Charged Poise: the open corridor of “feasibility study” rather than a simple yes/no. The cost—no guarantee of success, just a conditional, bureaucratic maybe—is legible, though the board’s deliberation and resistance remain offstage, keeping the climax somewhat soft.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is vividly and economically realized—the echoing boots on old tiles, dormant hydraulic systems, skylights, and carnival detritus all feel concrete and character-filtered. The environment isn’t just backdrop: its specific features (rainwater runoff channels, skylights, concourse geometry) directly enable the resurrection plan and shape her thinking. The sextant as a recurring object also charges the atmosphere and final image, though it influences meaning more than on-page tactical choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the “dead structure” can be reimagined and preserved—appears early and coheres to the end. Pressure escalates via her deepening commitment (mapping all flows, drafting ninety pages) and then crystallizes around the board decision, which narrows her options to a study instead of outright approval. Still, conflict is mostly conceptual and institutional; no on-page antagonist or sharp reversal presses her into a difficult trade-off, so the felt cost and escalation remain relatively subdued.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of reclamation vs. demolition, intention as navigation, and “equations for hope” emerge organically from Sable’s work and the sextant motif rather than bolt-on commentary. The line “Intention is the first coordinate” and the maze-of-intentions reflection reweight the ending, where the feasibility study becomes a tentative first coordinate rather than a bureaucratic shrug. A few formulations (“new equations for hope,” “resurrection was cheaper than demolition”) skate close to thesis-stating, slightly reducing the sense of thematic subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The third-person limited voice is consistent, with diction tuned to a thoughtful, technically minded twenty-two-year-old yet capable of lyric turns (“until they sang”). POV control is clean—no head-hopping—and the narrative distance modulates smoothly between concrete observation and reflective abstraction. The tone of cool, analytic wonder is distinctive without feeling mannered.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is polished and efficient: most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, character, theme) without padding, and rhythm varies well between long reflective lines and crisp concrete details. Metaphoric threads (mazes, flows, resurrection) are coherent rather than over-stacked, and there’s little redundancy or scaffold. Occasional abstractions (“formulas that could prove to a municipal board that resurrection was cheaper than demolition”) are more conceptual than sensory, but they fit the bureaucratic and engineering frame and don’t significantly drag momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The combination of an abandoned colony spaceport, carnival-engineered infrastructure hacks, and a civil engineer’s bureaucratic resurrection scheme feels fresh and specific. The sextant and “intention” motif gives the piece a non-obvious conceptual spine that elevates it above a straightforward reclamation story. While the core arc (young idealist vs. cautious institution) is familiar, the infrastructure-as-hope angle and maze-of-intentions framing constitute a distinctive synthesis.</comment>
