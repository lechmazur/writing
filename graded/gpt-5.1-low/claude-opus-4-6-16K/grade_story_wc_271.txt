<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Noor’s characterization is rich, embodied, and consistent, from her meticulous gardening to the way her body betrays her in flashbacks. Her survivor’s guilt and desire for solitude sit alongside a stubborn, practical hope, culminating in the small but meaningful choice to pin the photograph on the wall. The internal arc—from tending in exile to allowing Rasha’s image back into shared space—feels earned. The only slight softening is the occasional conceptual phrasing (“anchor optimism in realism”), which edges toward abstraction rather than pure felt experience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The accumulative structure is tight: abandonment of the arboretum, Noor’s arrival and trauma, the problem of freezing, practice with Dr. Liang’s framework, and the pneumatic-drill episode that yields the “pearl.” Closure lands cleanly in the evening scene, where her relationship to the photograph and to her panic reconfigures into an earned stasis. Causality is subtle but firm—because of the somatic work, she can meet the trigger differently—and the cost (persistent shaking, crooked lavender, no miracle cure) remains on the page. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is clear by the midpoint and held through the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The arboretum on the seaside cliff is vividly rendered—salt wind, thyme between flagstones, rusting lantern room—and always filtered through Noor’s relationship to growth and neglect. Setting is not a postcard; it mirrors and deepens the themes of abandonment and persistent tending, and recurs meaningfully in the final image with the Aleppo pines in copper light. The environment does not strongly constrain tactical choices in-scene, but it powerfully charges the emotional stakes and closure. Detail is economical yet specific, with almost no dead description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Noor can live with her trauma without being incapacitated—is established early via the freezing problem and her quiet routine. Pressure escalates credibly when the pneumatic drill fires, transforming her practice from theoretical to tested under real duress. Her agency lies in endurance and attention rather than big decisions, and the cost (physical aftermath, imperfect work, ongoing vulnerability) is not waved away. The conflict remains mostly internal and quiet, but within that register, the tightening is clear and satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of survival, unearned luck, and the coexistence of wound and growth emerge organically from particulars: abandoned lighthouse vs. thriving arboretum, Hellfire crater vs. Aleppo pines, the bodily ledger of somatic markers. The “pearl of stillness” metaphor shifts from therapist’s concept to lived, bodily proof, reweighting everything that came before. The line about “not a fantasy of healing but evidence…that she could hold both the wound and the world” edges toward explicit statement but is still grounded in concrete experience and avoids moralizing. The final image of Rasha’s photo beside cutting calendars and tide charts offers a resonant, non-literal answer about how to live with the dead.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent and distinct, with a calm, precise observational texture that suits Noor’s temperament and the piece’s contemplative mode. Diction and syntax are controlled, shifting subtly toward tighter rhythms in panic-related passages without becoming mannered. The brief explanatory register around “somatic markers” is justified by Dr. Liang’s presence and does not fracture POV or distance. Overall, the narrative feels like a singular, confident consciousness rather than generic literary voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, images are sharp (“the world flattening into a single bright pane of terror”), and almost every line carries multiple functions (character, world, theme). There is no evident scaffolding, synonym churn, or mixed metaphor; the prose remains clear even at its most lyrical. Expository material about trauma physiology is compressed and purposeful rather than bogging momentum. The closing paragraphs in particular balance precision and resonance without tipping into purple prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements—post–drone-strike Yemeni survivor, forgotten cliffside arboretum, somatic therapy, and the “pearl of stillness”—feels fresh and non-template. The story takes a familiar subject (PTSD) but treats it through specific, unlikely particulars (Aleppo pines in salvaged lighthouse glass, automation of the beacon) that could not be swapped out without loss. Emotional insight is grounded in concrete practice rather than grand revelation, and the risk of pairing clinical terminology with lyric description pays off. The result is memorable and distinctively its own.</comment>
