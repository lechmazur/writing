<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lenora is sharply etched—a professional whose “persistent curiosity” and tenderness toward the grieving feel specific and embodied. Her conflict between curiosity (closing a file, satisfying anomaly) and emergent care is present but could be dramatized with a bit more friction rather than largely asserted. The old woman is simply drawn yet affecting, especially in “the thinnest sound Lenora had ever followed.” The closing choice—to prioritize walking this one woman home over filing the report—reads earned and character-consistent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The structure is clean: a single causal chain from mist/call → tracking with the hearing aid → encounter → emotional stabilization → walk home. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Lenora’s purpose reframes from procedural tracing to incidental heroism, with visible emotional cost and relief on the page. Causality holds throughout; no beats feel arbitrary, and the anomalous signal is satisfactorily resolved. Stakes are modest but coherent for this length and mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium and twilight are vivid and specific—“breath held too long,” “last daylight bled copper”—and grounded enough to avoid white-room syndrome. Setting clearly supports tone and the thematic liminality between living and dead, though it rarely constrains concrete choices beyond being the locus of the calling. The hearing aid and notebook function as micro-setting elements that feel lived-in. A slight increase in how the space tactically shapes Lenora’s or the woman’s behavior would push this higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing a vulnerable mourner from being overwhelmed by a death-signal—is clear and present early. Pressure does escalate from abstract anomaly to intimate crisis once Lenora finds the woman and realizes how fragile she is, with the grip-and-sob sequence serving as the peak. However, obstacles are minimal; Lenora faces little resistance or trade-off beyond time and emotional labor, so the sense of cost is gentle rather than sharp. The resolution feels earned but somewhat low-tension for top-tier conflict scores.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of grief as continuing connection, the non-pathological nature of overwhelming mourning, and heroism as incidental rather than grand are integrated through concrete work and images (the hearing aid as lingering calibration of love). The line explicitly defining heroism edges toward essayistic but is supported by prior particulars, so it still lands more as crystallization than sermon. The story invites reflection on how institutions interact with private grief without overexplaining. Some complexity remains—Lenora’s curiosity is both flaw and gift—but there’s room for a slightly messier moral terrain.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The third-person close voice is controlled, lyrical without drifting into abstraction, and firmly aligned with Lenora’s sensibility and professional lens. Rhythm and diction adjust well between exposition of her role and the quiet crisis on the bench. Dialogue is sparse but natural and pointed, with the old woman’s single revealed line carrying disproportionate weight. There’s no POV leakage or awkward withholding, and the narrative stance feels confident and unified.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: images are precise, metaphors coherent, and there’s little to no scaffolding or synonym churn. Sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and interiority) without bogging down momentum. A few abstract formulations (“destabilize a grieving person,” “the last radiance of someone who had loved them”) lean slightly toward essay-register but remain grounded by surrounding concrete detail. The final paragraph in particular lands with clean, understated cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise—municipal “contact tracers for hearts” using a dead man’s hearing aid calibration to locate recipients of posthumous emotional signals—is strikingly fresh and well-integrated. The synthesis of bureaucratic language with numinous phenomena feels original rather than gimmicky, and the incidental-heroism angle gives the quiet plot real emotional specificity. The story follows its own rules consistently and commits to its small-scale emotional stakes. A touch more complication or surprise in the encounter itself could elevate the sense of inevitability in hindsight.</comment>
