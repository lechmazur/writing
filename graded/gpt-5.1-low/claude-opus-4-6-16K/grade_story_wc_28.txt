<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Selin’s motivation and interiority are sharply defined—her retrocognitive burden, chosen purpose (“to cradle empathy in arms of steel”), and the way she manages Oren’s grief feel specific and earned. Her key choice—to speak Dahra’s name and then continue to the next tile—reads as a believable expression of her values with visible cost. The main limitation is that internal contradiction stays mostly conceptual (gentle vs. radical) rather than dramatized as a live, conflicting impulse in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The structure is clean: single scene, single POV, with a clear progression from handling the tessera → entering Oren’s history → understanding the renaming → performing her own re-naming act. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: speaking “Dahra” loosens her retrocognitive trap slightly and reframes her work as ongoing, costly mercy rather than endless drift. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens; the only ceiling is that the global drive stays modest in scope (one ethical act), not a larger turn of circumstances.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plaza, shattered sky, ruined fountain, and mosaic are vivid and integrated, with strong, purposeful imagery (“fractured dome of ash and light, cracked like porcelain”). The environment charges the final image—a single beam of light on the blue tiles—without feeling like decorative backdrop. While the setting doesn’t heavily constrain her choices, the object-as-setting (tessera/mosaic) does so effectively enough to support a high score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Selin’s willingness to bear others’ grief and partially free herself by righting old wrongs—is clear and tightened through the revelation of Oren’s bargain and her decision to speak Dahra’s name. Internal and external conflict are elegantly aligned: the magistrate’s “aberrant mercy” forces a moral calculus Selin then answers in her own way. The pressure remains mostly contemplative rather than sharply escalated, which keeps it below top-tier tension despite its emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of memory, naming, mercy, and revolutionary empathy accrue convincingly from particulars: the hidden name in the tiles, the cost of bureaucratic “mercy” that erases identity, and Selin’s choice to reverse that erasure. The final movement—“empathy unhoused was just sentiment, and empathy given structure—given steel—was revolution”—lands a powerful conceptual repricing of her gift. The slight drawback is that this thesis is stated a bit too explicitly, nudging toward authorial commentary rather than letting the scene alone carry the insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical without losing clarity, and clearly inflected by Selin’s sensibility (architectural metaphors, disciplined empathy, quasi-clinical terms like “retrocognitively trapped” contextualized by her experience). Psychic distance is well controlled, with smooth shifts between concrete perception and interior reflection. There are no POV leaks or register jolts, and the cadence supports the story’s solemn, mythic tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, character) and the rhythm varies in a way that would read aloud well. Images are striking yet mostly disciplined (“some wounds do not heal—they simply become architecture”), with minimal redundancy or scaffolding. There is a hint of purple density, but it doesn’t blur sense or dilute the closure image, so it only very slightly limits the ceiling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The blend of retrocognition, post-catastrophic setting, and the notion of “aberrant mercy” expressed through renaming and hidden tessellated names feels genuinely fresh. The idea of empathy as subversive infrastructure—literally built into architecture—is a distinctive angle on both psychic powers and post-apocalyptic fiction. The only check on an even higher score is that the story flirts with familiar “empathy as revolution” language rather than pushing its moral calculus into wholly surprising territory.</comment>
