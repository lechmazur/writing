<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lena’s obsessive, sleepless drive and “methodically hopeful” temperament are sharply rendered through concrete behavior (the logbook, cross-referencing scripts) rather than labels. Her contradiction—on the brink of collapse yet unable to stop painting—is credible and carried through to the earned choice to finally sleep once she’s reached out to Deshi. Emotional texture is largely embodied (the gasping out of the daydream, the hurt of the phone light) and stays character-specific. The only mild limitation is that we see little of her life beyond this obsession, so the broader cost landscape remains narrow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: brush → compulsive painting/visions → anomalous vision of Deshi → online search → message → release into sleep. The structure is essentially one continuous scene with interleaved memory/vision, all anchored by the present-tense night in the greenhouse and the waxing moon, so orientation and lens (accumulative/textural with causal spine) hold. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: insomnia and the symbols are reweighted as a bridge of kindness across time and language, and the price (eleven days without sleep) is explicit. The ending’s quiet slide into rest undercuts any sense of arbitrary stop.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and particular—from the “bruise that never healed” skyline to the cracked tile and tomato plants—and always filtered through Lena’s tired, focused perception. Environment and objects meaningfully charge the story: the rooftop isolation, the greenhouse as a fragile bubble above a choking city, and the recurrent moonlight all shape when and how the visions occur. The brush and logbook function as micro-setting elements that constrain her actions and charge the final image of her lying among “tomato plants and wet canvases.” Minor deduction only because the smog-choked city exerts more atmospheric than tactical pressure on her choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake is Lena’s need to understand and ground her compulsion (and ultimately to rest) and it’s signaled early via her insomnia and logging. Pressure tightens when the usual vision pattern breaks—she sees the crying man/other greenhouse—which forces her into active investigation and then the vulnerable choice to reach out and claim, “I think I was the stranger.” The emotional cost is legible: she’s staked her bizarre experience on a tenuous human connection before finally surrendering to sleep. Escalation is more gentle than sharp; the conflict never becomes intense or morally knotted, which keeps this strong rather than searing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of lost languages, memory, and the persistence of anonymous kindness are woven through concrete images (sediment in a riverbed, clay symbols, rain-soaked canvases) rather than abstract sermonizing. The idea that they’re writing “the language…before words” is an explicit thesis line, but it grows organically out of the specific shared experience and the mystical brush, so it reads earned rather than tacked on. The final parallel images—her drifting into sleep in the greenhouse, Deshi somewhere “remembering the rain”—offer a resonant answer about what endures beyond language without flattening into moral. Slight deduction because that one line edges close to stating theme outright.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is confident, consistent, and lyrically charged, with a clear perceptual signature in its metaphors and rhythms (“the kind of instrument a calligrapher might use to write letters to someone she loved in a language that no longer existed”). Sentences modulate well between lush description and clean exposition (when she searches online, writes the message), avoiding both monotony and showy opacity. Diction feels plausibly within reach of a highly literate, artistically inclined focalizer. There’s no POV leakage or unmotivated register shift, and the narrative stance stays tightly hitched to Lena’s experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line by line, the prose is dense with meaning without tipping into muddle: metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned (sediment, bruised sky, captured moonlight) and rarely feel gratuitous. Information is efficiently layered—worldbuilding, character state, and theme often occupy the same sentence—and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. Rhythm varies, with longer, sinuous sentences in reflective passages and crisper ones around actions like gasping awake or composing the message. If anything, the density skirts purple in places, but it never undercuts clarity or the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements—an insomnia-fueled rooftop greenhouse, a dead woman’s moon-tipped brush, lost scripts re-emerging as acts of remembered kindness—is distinctive and feels organically tied rather than gimmicky. The cross-continental echo between Lena and Deshi reimagines “strangers helped me once” in a fresh, structurally grounded way. The premise could have veered into familiar mystical-art tropes, but the specificities (logbook rigor, community art forum post, Chengdu rain) and the smallness of the stake (one remembered kindness) keep it original. It’s not radically experimental, but it does achieve a memorable, non-obvious configuration.</comment>
