<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren’s motives are crystal clear, grounded in a long-standing caretaking ethos intensified by the death sentence. Her emotional life is specific and embodied (“Fear required a future tense she no longer conjugated”), and her choices under pressure (remodeling instead of surrendering) are consistent and revealing. Internal contradiction is quieter than it might be at this level—she is strikingly resolved from early on—but the Earned Stasis at the end feels fully motivated. The orchard-as-autobiography gives her a distinct, non-generic psychology.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The causal spine—diagnosis → return → decision to remodel → months of intervention → ritualized handoff and rest—is clean and coherent. The piece follows a Hybrid lens with accumulative time-lapse supported by concrete, causal interventions (copper, mapping, thinning), culminating in a clear Earned Stasis/Charged Poise closure when she removes the wires and sits down among the roots. Cost is clearly on the page: she has spent down her strength and prepared the orchard to outlive her. There are no orientation or lens-clarity issues, and the before/after is legible and felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The temple orchard and lithite pillars are exquisitely specific and fully integrated into action, not just backdrop; Maren’s tactics literally depend on the world’s rules (lithites sensing copper, pillars over-calcifying, negotiated architecture). The environment shapes stakes and possibilities at every beat and then charges the final image (light as “columns of its own”). Professional/technical detail (botanical diary, lithite biology) is plausible and filtered through her priorities, avoiding info-dump. The setting is inseparable from theme and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—repairing the interspecies architecture before her death—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Escalation is subtle and accumulative rather than driven by sharp reversals, but we do get a meaningful tightening as the estrangement of trees and pillars becomes intolerable after the diagnosis, pushing her into remodel-as-intervention. The cost (time, strength, acceptance of death) is evident, especially in “On the last day she felt strong enough…,” though there is no singular crisis beat. For a quiet, lyric piece, the pressure still deepens credibly and culminates in an earned renunciation of further action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme—mutual respect between unlike beings, work that outlasts the worker, architecture as negotiation rather than conquest—emerges entirely from particulars and is never sermonized. The lithites and oaks, the diary, and the choice to “remodel” instead of replant or demolish all concretize the abstract idea of interspecies respect and legacy. The final image of her calm attention under the re-aligned canopy conceptually re-prices both the diagnosis and the orchard’s “failure.” Lines like “To foster interspecies respect was, she believed, the only work that outlasted the worker” feel earned, not didactic, because the story has dramatized that belief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The third-person-limited voice is consistent, precise, and clearly colored by Maren’s sensibility—clinical yet tender, with measured, quasi-scientific diction that never slips into sterile abstraction. Sentences vary rhythmically, bending more lyric around key images without losing clarity. Technical vocabulary (“calcium deposits,” “lithite organisms,” “canopy angle”) feels organic to her mind and to the setting. There is no head-hopping or register drift; the narrative distance is expertly controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prose is lean yet rich, with high information density—nearly every sentence advances character, concept, or atmosphere, often doing two of these at once. Figurative language is purposeful and controlled (“The temple orchard was not built. It was negotiated.”; “Fear required a future tense…”), with no muddled metaphors or loops. Syntax and paragraphing support momentum through a time-compressed structure without feeling summary-heavy or mechanical. There are no noticeable scaffolds, redundancies, or line-level artifacts dulling the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a terminal cancer narrative with a living-temple, lithite-architecture ecosystem and copper-mediated interspecies “remodeling” is strikingly original. The botanical diary as autobiography and the idea of architecture as a negotiated mutualism give the piece a non-obvious but inevitable-feeling angle on mortality and stewardship. Stakes, worldbuilding, and theme are tightly fused; this couldn’t be trivially reskinned into another setting. The risk of a quiet, contemplative mode pays off through specificity rather than cleverness for its own sake.</comment>
