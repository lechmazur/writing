<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The colony’s collective character and Sable’s quiet bravery are clear and consistent, but interiority and contradictory impulses are only lightly sketched (“pressed her fingers to the letters as though testing whether they were warm” is a standout). Motivation—survival of the orchards and trust in the Gardener—reads cleanly, yet key emotional turns (fear, doubt, resistance) are summarized rather than dramatized in scene. The Gardener’s motivation “to orchestrate collective effort” is strong conceptually but remains stated more than conflicted. The final repricing (“YOU WERE ALWAYS THE GARDEN”) lands, but its emotional cost is inferred rather than embodied in one person’s dilemma.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The causal chain is coherent: blight → chalk messages → Sable’s action → water discovery → communal engineering → orchards’ revival → communal chalking and ghost’s disappearance. Structure is mosaic/summary-lyric rather than fully dramatized, but beats are well ordered and build toward a clear conceptual closure (the community internalizing the Gardener’s role). However, the solution path is relatively smooth, with no significant setback or on-page failure; pressure increases more by accumulation than by narrowed options. The closure cost—the ghost’s vanishing and the memory of lost worlds—is present but somewhat soft-focus, not decisively dramatized in time-bound scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and particular—the floating arches “like the ribs of some slumbering god,” mineral rain, chalk-lit sidewalks, and the butterfly bell all feel lived-in and precise. Environment meaningfully constrains and enables choices: the arches become both problem and resource, the ridge path and pulley systems are tactically used, and the bell and chalked sidewalks structure communal behavior. World rules are consistent and learned through action (striking arches for water, soil “not dead, only dormant”). The final image of orchards under a violet sky that echoes the Nebula of Respite elegantly charges both place and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the colony can save the orchards and thus its only home—is clear and carried throughout. Escalation is primarily conceptual and communal: the emergence of the chalk messages, Sable’s initial risk, and the organized harnessing of water deepen engagement rather than present hard reversals. There’s limited sense of real jeopardy once the Gardener proves “never wrong”; their instructions work without visible failure or sacrifice beyond implied labor and prior grief. The ending earns a resonant reframing, but the felt price paid on the page (as opposed to backstory loss) remains modest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Thematically, the story is rich: mutual care, collective competence, and the idea that communities become their own “gardener” are woven through specific images (chalk, arches, fungal networks, bell). The core insight—that hope is orchestrated but must be continued by the living—is earned by action, not overt moralizing, and the title-line “YOU WERE ALWAYS THE GARDEN” reweights everything before it. The ghost’s disappearance in tandem with neighbors chalking for each other crystallizes the theme of inherited responsibility and communal authorship. A slight tidiness and overt sentiment in the final paragraph keeps it just shy of the most complex, lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct texture (“the soil exhaled dust where it once breathed sweetness”; “sanctuary made visible”). Focalization is mostly at a communal distance with moments narrowing to Sable, and this modulation feels deliberate and controlled. Diction fits the quasi-mythic, SF-fable mode without slipping into purple or academic register. If anything, voice sometimes smooths over conflict by its omniscient calm, slightly reducing immediacy in high-stakes beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, precise, and information-dense, with metaphors that generally cohere and earn their place. There’s little scaffolding or redundancy; transitions between beats are efficient, and description often does double duty as worldbuilding and thematic work. A few images verge on the lush (“brambled with the memory of every world they had already lost”) but remain controlled rather than overwrought. The prose sustains momentum despite a largely summarizing mode.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of an altruistic ghost, a chalk-orchestrated communal repair of an alien orchard, and the reweighted final claim that the people “were always the garden” feels fresh and memorable. The butterfly watering bell, floating arches, and nebula-toned Gardener synthesize SF and mythic fable in a way that feels organic rather than gimmicky. The twist is conceptual rather than plotty, and it grows naturally from prior particulars (the ghost’s role as orchestrator, not savior). The main limiting factor is that conflict resolution is relatively untroubled, which slightly softens the sense of risk-taking.</comment>
