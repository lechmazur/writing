<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voss’s motivation is strong, specific, and consistent—from the opening grief and suspicion to the final choice to act, her throughline feels credible and earned. Her profession as a sensory map maker is well integrated with her emotional life rather than a gloss of competence. Internal contradiction is present (passive mapping vs. active intervention) but only lightly dramatized on the page. The relationship with her mother is powerful but mostly idealized; we don’t glimpse many flaws or frictions that would add further depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: abandoned bay → shard crossings → tonight’s crossing → revelation of the administrator’s coercion and the mother’s choice → Voss’s reoriented mission. The single summarized sequence of prior crossings is efficient and doesn’t harm clarity, and the one big turn (learning the true nature of the “accident”) lands with satisfying closure. The ending offers a clear before/after in Voss’s stance, moving from investigation to planned accountability and possible reunion. The main structural limitation is that the crucial confrontation exists only as a brief vision, keeping some stakes at a slight remove.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport repair bay is vividly evoked through specific, tactile, and technical detail (“corroded hull plating,” “drip of recycled condensation,” “severed coolant lines”) and is firmly anchored in Voss’s unique sensory perception. The setting is more than a backdrop, as alternate versions of the same bay become the stage for each universe’s glimpse of her mother, tying atmosphere directly to structure. However, the environment only lightly constrains present-tense choices; most pressure comes from information rather than physical obstacles or resources in the bay itself. The shard functions well as a micro-setting object charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering what truly happened to Voss’s mother and what that means—is clearly established and meaningfully tightened by the on-page crossing that reveals coercion and sacrifice. The revelation changes Voss’s options and self-conception, catalyzing her shift from passive mapper to active builder of a usable map others can follow. Still, most of the conflict is conceptual and retrospective; Voss doesn’t face significant real-time resistance in the present, and the institution’s threat is glimpsed rather than pressing directly on her. The cost is felt but primarily emotional and future-oriented, not yet forcing a hard trade-off on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of institutional secrecy, the ethics of exploiting multiversal access, and the “weight of withheld truth” are organically embedded in events, not sermonized, culminating in the revaluation of the mother’s disappearance as an act of protection rather than abandonment. The contrast between official erasure and the mother’s self-sacrifice yields a resonant, conceptually rich ending image (“ballast” rather than “crushing” grief). At times, the phrasing edges toward explicit abstraction (“weight of that withheld truth”), but it remains grounded enough in concrete stakes to avoid didacticism. The piece invites reflection on love, agency, and accountability without collapsing into a neat moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is confident, controlled, and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature shaped by Voss’s sensory grafts and technical lexicon. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, supporting both atmospheric description and moments of acceleration around the crossing. The narrator’s knowledge stays tightly bound to what Voss can infer, and there’s no POV slippage. Elevated diction feels appropriate to the SF register and Voss’s expertise, though a few abstract phrases could be slightly tightened to keep everything fully character-grounded.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is precise, economical, and vivid, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotional charge (“She was a sensory map maker, one of the last, and the bay's ghost signals told her everything official records refused to.”). Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and the recurring weight/balance imagery in the ending is both clear and thematically apt. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding phrases, or line-level artifacts that drag momentum or obscure sense. A mild density of modifiers in places could be pared for even sharper impact, but it doesn’t materially harm clarity or propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The combination of a “sensory map maker” with nerve grafts, a rhythm-locked green shard, and cross-universe mapping as investigative method feels fresh within a well-trodden multiverse trope. The idea of mapping parallel versions of a single place to triangulate a loved one’s fate is conceptually elegant and well tied to character. The administrator’s coercive plan and the mother’s sacrificial redirect are familiar shapes but executed with enough specificity to avoid cliché. It’s inventive and polished, though not quite at the level of startling or transformative originality.</comment>
