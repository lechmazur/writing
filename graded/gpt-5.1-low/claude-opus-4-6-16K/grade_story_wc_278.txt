<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s guilt, technical obsession, and star-mapped body create a specific, textured psyche, and her arc from avoidance to writing back feels earned. The firmware and letters arise directly from her longstanding wound, not from generic grief. Contradictory impulses—urge to destroy the device vs. need to see it through, dread of the letters vs. compulsion to read—are present and credible. The only slight limitation is that we never see her make a truly hard, risky external choice beyond the internal turn to respond.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story follows a clean accumulative structure: lab → malfunctioning firmware → ghost translations → discovery of letters → emotional reconfiguration → final letter and device’s silence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: Maren shifts from frozen guilt to a tentative reconnection, and the device’s “finished” state marks a clear before/after. Causality is coherent—the letters and amber concretely trigger the final confrontation rather than a vague epiphany. The plot remains quiet and mostly internal, but within that mode it’s tightly handled.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Laboratory of Lost Sounds is vivid and specific—jars of silence, wax cylinders, the basement of a building off any map—and infuses every beat with an otherworldly, melancholic texture. The environment is not just decorative: the lab, the desk, and the firmware all shape what she can discover and how the haunting manifests, and the jars “settling” at the end charge the closure image. Micro-setting objects (amber, desk, firmware) also function as a coherent physical constellation. The only reason this doesn’t push higher is that the lab constrains mood more than concrete tactical options.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Maren will remain trapped in guilt or move toward her brother—is legible early via the firmware’s origin and her memory of the crying infant. Pressure escalates as the firmware shifts from translating imagined cries to seemingly aware messages, then deepens when the letters and amber force her to re-interpret the haunting as relationship rather than punishment. The final turn is her decision to address her brother directly and accept the cost of re-opening contact, with the firmware’s silence as emotional punctuation. Escalation is more deepening than reversal and never quite reaches a knife-edge decision, keeping this just short of the top tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of guilt, translation, “trapped time,” and the persistence of patterns emerge organically through objects and actions—the firmware, the amber, the constellations—rather than overt moralizing. The ending’s meteor-tail image and the constellations on her arms subtly reprice the idea that although damage is irreversible, its pattern can be faced and repurposed. The haunted firmware concept marries theme and plot: her attempt to mechanize understanding becomes an externalization of her own haunted interiority. A faint hint of neatness in the “I know” line brushes sentimentality but does not tip the piece into it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Maren’s sensibility—cosmic metaphors, sonic imagery, and technical details feel of a piece with her character. Diction and syntax are controlled, with good modulation between more compressed, eerie description and slightly more expansive reflective passages. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative distance stays consistent and trustworthy. A touch more roughness or idiosyncrasy under emotional peak could push this further into the exceptional range.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and usually do double or triple duty (advancing plot, revealing character, and maintaining atmosphere). Figurative language—“meteor-hush moments,” “ghosts of cries, spectral wails that rose from the circuitry like steam,” “trapped time”—is vivid and coherent without feeling overwrought. There is minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and rhythm supports the accumulating pressure and the quiet landing. A few lines verge on lushness, but they don’t blur clarity or the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a haunted firmware that translates baby cries, a laboratory of lost sounds, and the amber “trapped time” is distinctive and memorable, not a familiar template with new names. The choice to resolve the haunting through a small, intimate act (writing back) instead of spectacle feels both non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Motifs (constellations, sound jars, meteor tails) are integrated with emotional stakes rather than pasted on. It stops short of truly radical risk, but within its mode it’s notably fresh.</comment>
