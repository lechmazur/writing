<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The guardian’s internal contradiction—feral vigilance vs. dimensional homesickness—is specific, embodied, and present in every major beat, and the final renunciation (staying) feels credibly costly given how sharply her longing is drawn. The interiority is vivid and character-particular (“feral the way a theorem is feral”), and her micro-choices with the pendant track cleanly with that psychology. The Earned Stasis at the end (“the homesickness…became a room she could furnish”) is well motivated by prior pages. The only reason this doesn’t go higher is that her emotional state shifts a bit smoothly into acceptance, with little momentary irrationality or backsliding under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Structure is clean: a long-established equilibrium of waiting, a clear inciting complication (the pendant), an interior dilemma, and a decisive choice that reconfigures the initial condition. Causality is simple but solid—finding the pendant directly creates the only true fork and the final Earned Stasis has a legible before/after and cost. The accumulative/textural drive is consistent: each paragraph layers atmosphere and homesickness until the pendant tightens options. It stops shy of 9+ because the pressure from that choice, while real, is kept philosophically quiet rather than sharpened into a more acute on-page crisis.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The frozen garden and mist aren’t just pretty; they’re the story’s operating environment, shaping how she guards the library (becoming the perimeter) and literally staging the final image (pendant on the frozen fountain arc, her merged with garden/light). Sensory work is rich and selective—ice-locked roses, glass-bridge fountain, mist as “breath between teeth”—and always filtered through her feral, dimensional sensibility. World rules (frozen time, softened light boundaries) are coherent and feed directly into the emotional and thematic stakes. Minor holdback from the 9s is that the setting constrains mood and stance more than it actively constrains present-tense tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—leave for a nearer-home dimension or remain guarding—is signaled clearly and tightened meaningfully once the pendant appears. The story earns its quiet mode: the escalation comes as an internal ethical and existential test rather than external danger, culminating in a genuine renunciation that closes off a live path. Internal and external conflicts interweave well (her duty to the library vs. ache for other geometries), and the refusal to use the pendant lands as a real loss. The pressure could be edged slightly higher by dramatizing more immediate risk or consequence to choosing either option, which would push this closer to top-tier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—living with uncertainty, homesickness, and the nature of “home” as a stance rather than a place—emerges organically from particulars: frozen time, wrong angles of light, cultists’ doors, her decision to leave the pendant for others. The closing reframing (“The homesickness did not vanish. It became a room she could furnish.”) is resonant and reweights prior images effectively. However, “To make friends with uncertainty was not to resolve it” reads as a slightly on-the-nose thesis articulation rather than leaving that conclusion entirely to image and action, trimming some subtlety. The piece still invites reflection beyond itself without collapsing into a tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The third-person limited voice is distinctive, lyrical, and controlled; diction like “feral the way a theorem is feral” and “dimensionally homesick” feels unified with the character’s mind rather than imposed. Rhythm varies well between long, hypnotic sentences and sharper turns around key realizations (the pendant, the decision), and psychic distance remains stable. The abstract, quasi-philosophical register fits both character and world, and patterning around mist/light/frost is consistent and purposeful. It just misses the very top band because a couple of lines edge toward essayistic statement, slightly thinning the immersive texture in those moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, interiority) without obvious padding, and metaphors are inventive yet coherent with the established physics and concepts. There’s high information density without feeling overwritten, and the figurative language is disciplined—recurrent motifs rather than scattershot ornament. Syntax and paragraphing create a smooth, meditative momentum that suits the accumulative drive while still landing a clear, charged final line. I see no significant loops or artifacts; the only small restraint on a 9+ is that a few abstract formulations feel slightly explanatory rather than purely dramatized.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis here—a feral, theorem-like library guardian, dimensional light-borders, homesickness for wrong geometries—feels genuinely fresh while emotionally grounded. The central turn (choosing to remain, reframing homesickness into a “room” within waiting) is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight given the waiting-as-technology motif. Genre touches (cultists, forbidden indices) are used sparingly in service of theme rather than as template fantasy furniture. It doesn’t quite reach the rarest band only because the underlying conflict (duty vs. escape) is a familiar axle, even if beautifully reimagined in this cosmology.</comment>
