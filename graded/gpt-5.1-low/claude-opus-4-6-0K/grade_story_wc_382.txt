<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—to learn the language of buildings—is clear, specific, and consistently drives her choices from moving into the Harwood to accepting the seal. Mrs. Voss is sharply etched in a few strokes (flour on wrists, spectral quiet, “dead language tutor”) and her agency shapes every turn. What’s missing at an elite level is a stronger sense of Elara’s internal friction or cost at the moment of inheritance; she wants what she gets with little visible hesitation. The relationship is textured and believable, but the final acceptance comes almost too smoothly to feel fully crucible-tested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The structure is clean and legible: move-in → first knock → weeks of lessons → rooftop ritual and handoff, all under a single causal thread of apprenticeship. The accumulative build from casual neighborliness to formal succession is well paced, with the meteor-shower rooftop scene serving as a clear culminating shard. Closure is strong: the role of “translator” passes, reconfiguring Elara’s situation and knowledge with an evident before/after. The only limit is that the middle weeks are summarized rather than dramatized, which keeps escalation from feeling as textured as it might.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Harwood’s physicality—“cornices spoke in flourishes,” cracked mortar, lobby vaulting—and the rooftop garden under meteors are vividly realized and consistently filtered through an architect’s sensibility. Setting does real work: the building’s “voice,” the cornerstone inscription, and the rooftop’s liminal height all charge the ritual and final image. The obsidian seal and foundation stone knit micro-setting into theme effectively. It stops just short of 9-band because the environment rarely constrains concrete choices; it primarily enriches mood and meaning rather than altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Elara will truly become the Harwood’s next “translator” and what that implies—is present but kept mostly at an intellectual/spiritual register. There is a meaningful tightening at the rooftop interrogation, where Mrs. Voss tests and then forces a de facto choice by pressing the seal into Elara’s hand. However, there’s little sense of risk or competing desire; Elara never seriously wavers, and no alternative path is dramatized as being foreclosed. The conflict works for a quiet piece but lacks the felt price or escalation needed for top-tier stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of surface versus buried truth (“agreed upon lies” of facades), inheritance of knowledge, and listening to what structures confess accrue organically through action and imagery. The obsidian seal and the cornerstone inscription pay off thematically in the final realization that dead languages and old buildings are not dead but “sleeping,” reweighting everything that came before. There’s minimal overt moralizing; ideas are embodied in teaching, ritual, and perception rather than abstract lecture. A slightly more tangible cost to accepting the role would deepen the thematic bite from luminous to haunting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The third-person-limited voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Elara’s architectural obsession (“grammar of arches,” “syntax of load-bearing walls”). Diction is elevated but controlled, matching the slightly uncanny literary tone without feeling like authorial intrusion. Dialogue is sparse and effective, particularly Mrs. Voss’s lines, which carry authority and subtext. Under pressure on the rooftop, the voice holds steady without flattening or slipping registers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, precise, and often do double duty for atmosphere and characterization (“flourishes,” “measured declarations,” “murmured something she desperately needed to understand”). Figurative language is rich but not overstacked, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. The rhythm of longer, lyrical sentences in exposition against tighter lines in the rooftop interrogation feels intentional and effective. It falls short of the very top only because the prose, while excellent, doesn’t make a surprising leap or formal risk at the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a dead-language tutor, architectural semiotics, and a haunted-but-not-haunted apartment building feels fresh and particular rather than templated. The obsidian guild seal that encodes secret truths in foundations is a striking, memorable invention that ties character, world, and theme together. The mentor-passing-the-mantle structure is familiar, but it’s enlivened by the specific focus on buildings “speaking” and on translation as both scholarship and custodianship. Greater dramatized cost or an unexpected wrinkle in the succession would have pushed the originality from strong to exceptional.</comment>
