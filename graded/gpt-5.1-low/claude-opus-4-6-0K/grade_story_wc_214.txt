<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is concrete, particular, and consistent; the meteor empathy beat (“what it might mean to burn so brightly precisely because you were disintegrating”) credibly reorients her self-understanding. Her micro-choices—staying at a dead-end post, sweeping lenses, treating manuals as sutras—align with this. The endurance at the end (choosing to remain, stay soft, and keep tending) reads as an Earned Stasis with a visible cost in solitude. A minor limitation is that her internal conflict is more implied than dramatized in live, contradictory impulses on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The piece runs on an accumulative/textural drive: the routine of sweeping, nightly tracings, and increased logging builds toward the bolide and final stance. Causality is clean—empathy with meteors leads to an articulated reason for staying, which reframes her labor and the last scene. Closure is solid: the final beat reconfigures the premise into a conscious choice with cost. Stakes remain modest and purely internal, but they are coherent and scaled well to the length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and selective: basalt ridge, ash plains, volcanic dust, and obsolete dishes all feel tactile and lived-in. The yellow lantern glass functions as micro-setting and recurring object, charging both daily ritual and the final image with meaning. The neglected outpost context plausibly explains her solitude and the “overlooked era,” and the environment shapes her options (staying to maintain instruments versus leaving to rejoin humanity). Description is rich without devolving into tourism or white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to live in abandonment and fragility—is clear and tight. Pressure deepens meaningfully at the empathy-with-meteor moment and again at season’s end when the bolide and flourishing stillness crystallize her stance. Conflict is almost entirely internal and contemplative, with no external forcing mechanism to narrow options beyond background neglect, which keeps escalation subtle. The cost and renunciation are present but could be sharpened slightly on the page to reach higher bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of vulnerability as strength, attentiveness in an inattentive age, and quiet devotion emerge organically from Maren’s practices and the meteor imagery. The reweighting of fragility (“brilliance was not the opposite of fragility but its direct consequence”) is earned by concrete observation. However, the final sentence states the thesis almost as a moral—“to remain soft in a hard silence is not weakness. It is the oldest, most radiant form of strength.”—which edges into explicit sermonizing instead of fully trusting image and implication. This reduces some of the otherwise strong subtextual resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The third-person limited voice is stable, with a clear perceptual signature that blends Maren’s sensibility and a gently elevated narrative stance. Lexicon and rhythm suit the contemplative, quasi-spiritual frame (“read the maintenance manuals like sutras,” “flourishing stillness”) and modulate well at key beats. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and distance control feels deliberate. The lyric register remains coherent and character-anchored rather than generically ornate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is controlled, with high information density—most sentences do double duty for setting, character, and theme. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and coherent (e.g., “fine volcanic dust…like a gray prayer shawl,” “feel something she could not name, a resonance beneath thought”), and rhythm varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. There is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; momentum for this meditative mode is well maintained. A few lines approach purple, but they do not materially blur sense or dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fusion of cosmic maintenance work, spiritual inquiry, and phenomenological astronomy feels fresh and specific; “cosmic janitor” as a vocation is an excellent, non-gimmicky angle. The insight that meteoric brilliance arises from surrendering mass, then mapping that to human vulnerability, lands as emotionally and conceptually original. The story fully commits to its quiet, inward risk instead of chasing more obvious plot fireworks. While not formally radical, its synthesis of vocation, object (yellow glass), and inner arc is distinctive and memorable.</comment>
