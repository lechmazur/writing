<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren is sharply drawn—competent, reticent, observant—and her choices (going out alone, staying to repair the lamp, maintaining the stone correspondence) track cleanly with those traits. The inner contradiction (skeptic about ghosts, believer in the lantern room’s presence) gives her texture without overstatement. Emotional states are mostly embodied through perception and tactile work rather than abstract labels. The arc is an earned endurance/acceptance rather than a revelation, and the cost (self-imposed solitude and secrecy) is present but understated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The structure is cleanly causal and accumulative: lamp failure → journey → exploration of cairns → understanding → repair → ongoing pact. Orientation is clear early and never wavers, and the lighthouse-as-presence through the cairn messages provides a stable drive lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis: Maren commits to a continuing, secret duty that redefines her relationship to the tower. The cost—choosing an ongoing, private burden over returning the tower to normal bureaucratic order—is implied rather than dramatized in conflict with another party, keeping it just shy of truly exceptional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid, economical, and integral: the lantern room, Fresnel lens, gallery railing, and sea-weather details all inform action and tone. The haunted quality is mostly achieved through physical specifics—shadows pooling wrong, reflections that “belonged to no one present,” the tactile cairns—filtered through Maren’s professional eye. The environment constrains choices (isolation, necessary maintenance steps, the gallery as message-site) and charges the final image of the never-flickering lamp. This is close to exemplary, though there’s a slight tilt toward atmosphere over concrete constraint at the peak.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The central stakes—keeping ships safe and answering the place’s lonely protective urge—are clear and scale appropriately to the quiet mode. Pressure deepens as Maren moves from simple resupply duty to solitary investigator to someone who consciously takes on the haunt’s desire as a responsibility. Escalation is more emotional/textural than oppositional; there is no real resistance once she understands, so the choice to stay feels morally weighted but not acutely contested. The result is strong, cohesive tension rather than sharp conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of safety, remembrance, unsent letters, and the limits of language emerge organically through the cairn code and Maren’s reticence. The recurring images—stones, sea glass, the sweeping light—shift meaning from mere maritime practice to a shared, quasi-sacred labor. The final paragraphs articulate the themes a bit directly (“Some things exist best in the space between words”), edging toward statement rather than pure image-driven resonance. Even so, the emotional aftereffect is authentic and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The third-person voice is consistent, close to Maren but with a gently lyrical narratorial overlay that matches her sensibility and history. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with sentences that modulate nicely between longer, flowing description and tighter, action-oriented lines during maintenance. The voice teaches its slightly elevated, poetic register early (“color of a held breath”) and sustains it without slipping into mismatched jargon or abstraction. With no dialogue to test contrast, the piece nonetheless maintains a distinct, confident narrative texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line by line, the prose is polished, with high information density and minimal scaffolding; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or both. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and thematically aligned, rarely tipping into muddle or excess. A few constructions restate similar emotional notes (“humming grief,” “luminescent ache”) and the closing generalization could be trimmed for maximal sharpness. Overall, rhythm and clarity hold well, comfortably in publishable territory.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise—haunted lighthouse, protective ghost—is familiar, but the specific angle of a supply captain maintaining an anonymous stone-letter correspondence feels fresh. The cairn code and the focus on “bottling” safety as a haunting motive add a thoughtful twist to standard ghost-story tropes. The structure and imagery are elegant rather than radically inventive, and the story stays within a known emotional register. It’s a refined, distinctive iteration of a genre idea rather than a transformative departure.</comment>
