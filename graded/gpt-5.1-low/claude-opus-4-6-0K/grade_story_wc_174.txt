<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marcus is sharply drawn—urbane, conflict-avoidant, but ethically serious—and his shift from silence to proposing the authority reversal feels earned by the prior argument. His serenity and professionalism (calligraphy) interact convincingly with his ethics. Jin and Dara are sketched with enough specificity (Jin’s anger, Dara’s conflicted pragmatism) to pressure Marcus. The only limit is that their interior contradictions are mostly implied rather than dramatized in on-page micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The structure is clean: aftermath of argument → half-lit insight → concrete proposal to reverse authority → group’s wary acceptance → departure to test the new form. The drive is primarily situational/accumulative, with ethical pressure rather than plot twists, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration (they will hand off the story stick, with risk). The cost—relinquishing curatorial control and aesthetic safety—is legible in lines like “It might be terrible.” The only constraint is that we don’t see even a glimpse of the performance itself, so closure rests entirely on anticipation rather than a small on-page consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome is vividly and economically rendered (“heat still clung to the curved walls… like smoke that refused to rise”) and its properties (curved, parabolic, signal-receiving) dovetail with the thematic concerns of listening and power. Details like the defunct panels letting in “slashes of coastal moonlight” charge the mood and echo Marcus’s half-lit understanding. The harbor and bar district are sketched more lightly but enough to ground the final departure. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain tactics, but it meaningfully charges the imagery and thematic frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether and how to ethically tell stories about others’ suffering—is clear and under steady pressure from the recent argument and the looming performance at The Silt. Escalation comes via Marcus’s decision to invert authority and the group’s debate over that risk (“It might be terrible”). The price is conceptual and artistic rather than physical, but it does foreclose an easier path of continuing as before. Because the confrontation happens off-page and the argument itself is summarized, the felt escalation is a touch muted compared to what it might be with one more directly dramatized clash.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The piece engages deeply with the ethics of representation and power—who owns a story, and whether beauty can coexist with exploitation—without sermonizing. Marcus’s proposal to “give them the stick” is a precise, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting the earlier accusations. Recurring images of signals, hush, and meteors reinforce a theme of reception, danger, and fleeting illumination. The only limit to a higher band is that some of the thematic language edges close to essayistic abstraction (“question was whether any story told about someone else's suffering could be ethical”) rather than letting scene alone carry all of it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is controlled, with a rich but coherent lexicon that fits an observant, aesthetically-minded protagonist (“dense and mineral-tasting, like the air before a meteor burns through atmosphere”). The narrative distance is steady, slipping into Marcus’s perceptions without head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but natural, with distinct tonal differences (Jin’s bluntness vs. Marcus’s measured speech). The elevated, lyrical narration sometimes edges toward essayistic, but it remains anchored in Marcus’s sensibility enough to feel motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most images do multiple jobs (advancing mood, character, and theme simultaneously). Metaphors around smoke, radar, and meteors are thematically cohesive rather than decorative, and there’s little to no paraphrase looping or filler. The prose maintains momentum even while reflective, with clear sequencing and very few unnecessary scaffolding phrases. It stops just short of the 9+ band because the figurative density is consistently high, which might risk saturation for some readers at peak beats, though clarity never truly suffers.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The combination of elements—an urbane calligrapher, a story stick ritual, subversive puppet shows in seedy bars, and a decommissioned radar dome as rehearsal space—is distinctive and feels organically interlocked rather than quirky for its own sake. The ethical-inversion device (audience words lettered live, puppeteers as instruments) is a fresh, specific way to explore well-trod questions about representation and power. The meteor and radar motifs give the piece a memorable conceptual texture. It just misses 9+ because we don’t see the method stress-tested in action, which would fully cement the originality at the level of consequences, not just premise.</comment>
