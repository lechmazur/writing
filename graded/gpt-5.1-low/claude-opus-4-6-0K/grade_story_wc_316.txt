<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Selu’s numbness, her history of ego death, and her conflicted love for Mira create a rich, specific interiority, and the mirror-relationship with Selu-2 (“You feel everything and it’s destroying you”) lands as a credible crucible. The final stance—arguing for joint custody and feeling the “raw ache of wanting”—is well earned by prior beats. Minor weakness: the numbness is occasionally told in abstract rather than embodied detail, so the fracture at the climax could gain even more force with sharper somatic texturing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: summons → evidence (brain in jar) → combat testimony → emotional recognition → joint-custody ruling, with no teleports or contrivances. Closure is decisive and on-page: Selu’s stance shifts from detached to actively wanting a shared future with her daughter, and the joint custody ruling carries visible cost. The brief backstory is efficiently anchored and feeds present stakes instead of stalling them. The situational frame (Temporal Judiciary, rewriting history) is coherent and serves as pressure rather than confusion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo and the world’s geology rewriting itself are vivid, memorable, and tightly filtered through Selu’s perception, giving the piece a strong atmospheric signature. Setting details like the combat platform, rope ladder, and the judge’s color-shifting robes all reinforce tone and concept. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics or choices beyond symbolism; the canyon/ocean shifts could matter more directly to what’s possible on the platform.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (Mira’s custody, and what kind of mother Selu can be) is clear from the summons through the hearing, and it tightens effectively in the combat testimony where emotional fitness is tested in real time. The turn comes when Selu recognizes Selu-2’s terror and reframes the conflict from a zero-sum custody fight to a need for integration, paying a price by relinquishing the “win.” The combat itself is somewhat summarized rather than dramatized beat by beat, which softens the sense of escalating jeopardy in the middle stretch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of fragmented selfhood, the necessity of integrating opposites, and the cost of both numbness and overwhelm emerge organically from the clone relationship, dojo method, and temporal instability. The final image—two incomplete mothers at the dojo’s edge above a newly written ocean, with the “brain in its jar between them”—beautifully reweights the story’s prior motifs. A slightly on-the-nose line (“She needs both. The stillness and the storm.”) edges toward articulation of the thesis but doesn’t collapse the scene into moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The third-person limited voice is confident, with precise yet unshowy diction and a consistent perceptual bias that matches Selu’s altered state. Dialogue is lean and pointed, carrying subtext and power shifts (“You can’t even cry” versus Selu’s later admission). POV control is tight; there’s no leakage into others’ interiority beyond what can be inferred, and psychic distance modulates well at the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (“moved through the world like smoke through a keyhole” is vivid and character-specific). Figurative language is frequent but generally controlled and legible, and there’s little in the way of scaffolding, redundancy, or template cadences. A few metaphors and abstractions (“dead terrain inside her chest”) flirt with familiar phrasing, but they don’t significantly blur sense or dampen momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of ego-death psychology, a Temporal Judiciary, clone custody law, and a floating rock dojo using “complementary opposites” is strikingly original, and it all coheres around a human-scale emotional problem. The worldbuilding conceits (history rewriting itself, brain-in-jar evidence, combat testimony) all refract the same core questions about identity and continuity. The final conceptual reweighting—parenthood as a joint stewardship of fractured selves—feels non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
