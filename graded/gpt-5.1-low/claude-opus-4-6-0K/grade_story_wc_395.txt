<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Maren’s professional competence, obsessive attentiveness, and ethical drive are sharply etched, and her behavior tracks cleanly from anomaly-hunting to whistleblowing. However, her internal conflict around the very high-risk decision to leak is underdeveloped; we see the decision, not much struggle or contradictory impulse. Embodied emotion shows up in small gestures (touching the patch, hands going cold) but remains relatively sparse. The final choice feels motivated and believable, but the personal cost is gestured at more than dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The investigative throughline is clean: recurring number → link to Okoro → draft message → maintenance log → proof of Lam’s lie → decision to call the journalist. The causal chain is logical and easy to follow, with a strong sense of before/after once the falsified inspection is uncovered. Some of the legwork is summarized rather than dramatized, which slightly flattens the discovery beats and undercuts maximal impact. Closure lands as a clear decisive change with conceptual cost, even if consequences are off-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The social network archive as “cathedral” is vivid and thematically apt, and details like “columns of light,” cached fragments, and memorial pages create a concrete, lived-in digital environment. The setting is filtered through Maren’s sensibility as a memory keeper, which strengthens atmosphere and theme. The Tern-9 patch functions as a micro-setting object that carries physical history into the digital realm. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical choices, it substantially charges the premise and the final sense of a system exhaling held breath.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The central stake—whether truth about Okoro’s death will remain buried—is clear and escalates from a subtle anomaly to a corporate crime with legal and moral implications. The turn from archival curiosity to whistleblower action is effective, and the discovery of Lam’s lie is a solid tightening beat. That said, pressure is mostly intellectual; we don’t feel immediate danger, resistance, or tangible risk to Maren beyond implication. Escalation works, but never quite bites as hard as it could given the scale of the coverup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Memory vs erasure, corporate amnesia, and the persistence of truth are woven organically through objects (the singed patch), setting (the archive’s hum), and plot (deleted profiles, overwritten logs). The closing image of the archive shifting from “forgetting” to a “held breath finally released” offers a resonant, non-literal answer: systems can be forced to remember, but only through human risk. The piece largely avoids explicit moralizing, though the final paragraph leans close to thesis-statement terrain (“she did not mean the body… she meant the truth”). Thematic integration is strong and coherent without much ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The close third-person narration has a distinct, slightly lyrical corporate-tech register that fits Maren’s role and the story’s speculative flavor. Metaphors like “columns of light” and “echo of forgotten songs” feel controlled and voice-appropriate, giving the prose texture without derailing clarity. POV remains stable and disciplined; we never slip out of Maren’s knowledge. Rhythm modulates effectively between denser descriptive passages and tighter, plot-bearing sentences as the investigation sharpens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, precise, and generally high in information density with minimal scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and key images (the singed patch, the hum of the archive, the implausible timestamp) are memorable and concrete. A few lines verge on the slightly abstract or expository (“silence… someone with authority deliberately constructed”) but remain clear and purposeful rather than florid. Overall momentum is strong, with no significant loops or muddle to dull the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The combination of a social-network data archivist, a recurring numerical glitch, and a corporate space-shuttle coverup feels fresh and specific rather than templated. Solving a “cold case” via ghost-data in a commercial platform is an inventive angle that integrates technology, grief, and corporate ethics in a non-obvious way. The mission patch as a half-melted relic bridging physical catastrophe and digital erasure is a strong, distinctive touch. While the underlying trope of exposing a corporate lie is familiar, the execution and milieu give it genuine originality.</comment>
