<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren’s professional competence, curiosity, and protective instinct are sharply drawn, and her rule-breaking reads as a natural extension of those traits. Interiority is specific (the hearing aid as sacred, her shaking hands) rather than generic. The internal conflict between protocol and compassion is present but could be more fully dramatized in the moment of decision rather than implied. Emotional cost is felt but relatively light and tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: dead call → trace to Calloway → discovery of the child’s pulse → urgency → protocol-breaking intervention → aftermath. Orientation (who/where/when) is established quickly and never slips, and the world rules about callings and vulnerability are consistent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she has altered the outcome for the child and accepted the price of breaching procedure, while committing to continue listening. The cost is mostly conceptual/professional rather than sharply dramatized, but it’s nonetheless legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The misty conservatory is vivid and economical, with details like fog “like a congregation” and condensation “weeping” that mesh with the haunting premise. The environment shapes tone and her solitude rather than constraining tactical options, but the hearing aid as a tool is strongly embedded in the physical space. World rules around the calls and the Bureau feel coherent without over-explaining. The setting charges the final quiet image but does not quite operate as an active pressure on choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The main stake—preventing a vulnerable living person from being “pulled under”—is clear and concretized through the child’s accelerating pulse. Escalation is well handled via the shift from a standard high-risk case (Calloway) to a more urgent, off-file child in danger, which forces Maren into a higher-risk tactic. Her act of speaking into the channel and pushing her heartbeat across is a decisive move that resolves the conflict. The price and potential fallout of breaking protocol are underplayed on the page, slightly softening the sense of lasting cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of care versus consumption, bureaucratic duty versus personal moral responsibility, and “incidental heroism” arise from action rather than exposition. The idea that older, imperfect tools catch the “sub-whispers” nicely echoes the way flawed people may be better attuned to others’ pain. The closing paragraphs gesture toward a quiet, ongoing ethic of listening without slipping into overt sermonizing, though “Incidental heroism, the Bureau would call it later” edges close to thesis-stating. Overall, the emotional aftereffect is tender and quietly hopeful rather than pat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is supple and confident, mixing procedural clarity with a lyrical, haunted register that suits both Maren and the world. Occasional zooms out (“Incidental heroism, the Bureau would call it later”; “Somewhere… a child slept without nightmares”) read as a stable narratorial stance rather than head-hopping. Diction and syntax are controlled and consistent, with an identifiable perceptual signature in how Maren notices tools, signals, and vulnerable people. The modulation under pressure is smooth, not dramatically compressed, but remains clear and effective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and strong verbs, and nearly every line advances character, world, or tension. Figurative language is selective and coherent; images like “twilight bled purple through the glass ceiling” and calls as “emotional contagion” feel fresh rather than overwrought. There are no evident loops, scaffolding, or filter-verb stacks that drag momentum. A few descriptive phrases lean lush, but they don’t obstruct clarity or blunt the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The conceit of “contact tracers for hearts” and analog hearing aids as privileged channels to the dead is a distinctive, well-integrated twist on paranormal bureaucracy. The fusion of public-health language (contagion, tracing) with intimate emotional stakes feels fresh. The arc itself—a quiet professional breaking protocol to save a child—is familiar but executed with enough specificity and world-building texture to feel singular. The piece takes stylistic and conceptual risks without losing coherence, though it stops short of truly surprising moral or structural turns.</comment>
