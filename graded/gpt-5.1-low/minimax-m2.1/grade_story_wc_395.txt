<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maren’s role and temperament are clear and specific, and her “brightly attentive” nature plausibly drives her pattern-recognition and descent into the archive. The sensed absence that “suddenly sharpened into something specific” is a good internal turn, but it remains more conceptual than embodied. Her conflict at the end (restore Yuki vs preserve absence) is stated rather than dramatized with contradictory impulses on the page. Yuki, as a distributed presence, is intriguingly sketched but never complicates Maren’s psychology beyond the investigatory drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal chain from cold case → pattern of 47s → buried subdirectory → revelation about Prometheus → realization of Yuki-as-distributed-consciousness is coherent and satisfying. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid early, and the investigation mode holds cleanly under a causal drive lens. Closure lands as a charged poise moment—Maren begins tracing deleted files with an implied stance toward restoring Yuki—but the concrete costs and consequences (especially corporate blowback) are under-articulated. The case’s arrival “on a Thursday” and its handoff from the company is a slightly convenient setup but doesn’t break logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The social network archive and sublevel server farm are vivid and tonally apt, with the “echo of forgotten songs” and looping profile melodies giving the environment a haunted, tactile presence. Setting is consistently filtered through Maren’s sensibility as a memory keeper, so details feel lived-in rather than touristic. The environment meaningfully shapes the premise (ghost profiles, hidden subdirectories, old servers the company has forgotten), and the final movement into “the silence where the company had hidden what it could not bear to remember” is atmospherically strong. The setting stops just short of constraining a specific tactical choice in scene, which keeps it out of the very top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Maren will recover Yuki’s dispersed consciousness/work or collude in its erasure—is clear by the end and thematically rich. Escalation is mostly informational and pattern-based: recurring 47s, then hidden coordinates, then the suppressed Prometheus data, culminating in the realization that Yuki is still “alive” in the system. However, the pressure remains largely abstract; the company’s expectations and potential retaliation are implied but never concretely dramatized, and Maren’s final action (beginning to trace the files) is not framed against a sharpened, immediate risk. The result is a compelling conceptual conflict with limited on-page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of corporate erasure, digital afterlives, and the ethics of memory emerge organically from the archive work, ghost profiles, and the suppression of extraterrestrial contact. The recurring motifs—forgotten songs, the constellation patch, the recurring numbers—gain added weight by the end, especially when the patch’s stars reframe as a “door to leave open.” The story resists tidy moralizing, leaving Maren in a charged ethical posture rather than stating a thesis about what she ought to do. Some explanatory lines (“the lie that had structured Yuki’s disappearance”) lean toward summary rather than letting subtext fully carry the weight, which slightly dulls the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and distinctively colored by Maren’s archivist mindset, with a strong feel for pattern and residue. Diction and rhythm are largely apt—elevated but not showy—and the narrative distance stays stable without head-hopping. Occasional expository patches (e.g., explaining the board’s motive in classifying Prometheus as “commercially undesirable”) tilt toward omniscient explanation rather than Maren’s immediate perception. Even so, the voice remains coherent and memorable, supporting the story’s haunted-technological mood.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft is generally clean, with good information density and purposeful repetition (“digital ghost images,” “echo of forgotten songs”) that functions as motif rather than clutter. Sentences vary in length and structure, maintaining momentum while accommodating some lyrical phrasing. The heaviest informational block—the board’s decision about Prometheus and the commercial implications—reads slightly more like a compact exposition drop than fully dramatized discovery but doesn’t significantly drag. There are no major artifacts, mixed metaphors, or syntactic glitches to undercut the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The fusion of a corporate social network archive, a “memory keeper” protagonist, and a missing researcher whose consciousness persists as distributed data in forgotten servers feels fresh and thoughtfully executed. The use of profile songs and recurring numeric patterns as a clandestine communication channel is an inventive twist on digital ghost tropes. The premise could echo other AI/ghost-in-the-machine stories, but the particular occupational lens and ethical corporate angle give it a distinct identity. The ending’s reframing of “deleted files” as a place where a person might be traced provides a non-obvious but earned conceptual shift.</comment>
