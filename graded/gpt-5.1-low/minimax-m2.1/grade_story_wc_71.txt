<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s characterization is specific and coherent—her “creeping normality noticer” sensibility and inherited attentiveness to displaced objects feel distinctive and drive how she moves through the house. Motivation (to understand why some houses feel alive) is clearly stated and her micro-choices (cataloguing shifts, reverently handling the cup, keeping the shard) align with it. Internal contradiction is muted; she meets the realization with calm recognition rather than any friction or cost, which limits depth. The final inheritance insight feels earned but emotionally gentle rather than hard-won.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural structure is clean: one continuous evening, a clear investigative drive, and a conceptual closure where the house’s “aliveness” is redefined as memory and presence. Causality is soft but coherent—her noticing → intensified awareness via the shard → realization of inherited sensitivity and house-as-memory. Closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing with a legible before/after understanding, though the cost of this new knowledge is understated. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early, and the pattern of quiet accumulation holds consistently.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are a major strength: the harbor road, “violet hour,” sea lavender, and lingering orris-root scent build a tangible, mood-dense environment. Details feel filtered through Mira’s sensibility as someone trained to notice small displacements and traces, so the house reads as palpably inhabited by memory. The recurring orris-root aroma and the lived-in house objects charge the final sense of the home as an archive of presence. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain action, it deeply inflects perception and the thematic frame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to understand why some houses feel alive—is clear, but opposition and pressure remain very low; nothing resists her inquiry beyond ambient mystery. Escalation occurs as a gradual deepening of awareness (especially once the shard grows warm), but no concrete option is foreclosed and no visible price is paid. The final realization reweights her experience rather than resolving a fraught dilemma, which suits the mode but keeps tension modest. As a result, the piece reads more as a lyric exploration than as a scene under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Themes of memory, inheritance, and spaces as living archives emerge organically from the house, the orris root, and Mira’s way of noticing. The notion that some inheritances pass “through the body itself” is resonant and connects nicely to her grandmother’s craft and the house’s accumulated presence. However, the final paragraph states the thesis rather bluntly (“Houses feel alive because they are alive…”) rather than leaving more to subtext and image. The insight feels true but a bit over-articulated for top-tier literary subtlety.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is controlled, confident, and lyrically consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (attuned to micro-displacements, atmospheres, and sensory residue). Syntax and diction are elevated but coherent with the contemplative, quasi-mystical lens on the house; there’s no head-hopping or stance drift. Rhythm varies well between long, flowing sentences and tighter emphases, particularly around the shard and the final realization. The voice feels publication-ready, though a slight trim of abstractions could sharpen impact further.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally precise, multi-functional, and rhythmically pleasing, with vivid figurative choices like “streetlights daydream” and “shard of hush.” Prose density is high but mostly justified; sensory detail and metaphor seldom feel redundant or incoherent. There are minor instances of abstraction or slightly purple phrasing that could be tightened without loss (“profoundly ordinary,” “quiet blaze of recognition”), but they don’t obscure meaning or the closure image. No significant loops or scaffolding artifacts drag momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece offers a fresh-feeling synthesis: a non-spectral “haunted” house, inherited sensory attunement, and the orris-root shard as a physicalization of hush and memory. The idea that houses are alive as condensations of presence rather than via conventional ghosts is nicely reframed, and “creeping normality noticer” is a distinctive lens. Still, the underlying notion of spaces holding memory and familial gift of perception is somewhat familiar in literary fiction. The execution is refined enough to lift it, but not into the truly startling or formally risky range.</comment>
