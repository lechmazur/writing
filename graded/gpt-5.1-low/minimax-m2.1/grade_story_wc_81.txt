<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira’s vocation-grounded motivation (“trace honest origins”) is clear and her temperament—patient, meticulous, drawn to marginalia—feels particular. The slow, sedimentary realization that she is inheriting a clandestine role is well earned, and the final commitment to continue the hidden archive reads credible. What’s missing for a higher score is a sharper sense of internal contradiction or cost on the page; her choice feels right but not difficult. The piece leans into contemplative steadiness rather than dramatizing a pulled-in-two conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The accumulative structure is clean: blackout → altered perception → pattern in marginalia → discovery of the sanctuary → decision to join its work, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/earned stasis: Mira’s understanding of the archive (and her job) is permanently reweighted, and she quietly forecloses a safer, purely bureaucratic path. However, the cost of this shift remains mostly implied (no concrete danger or sacrifice is dramatized), keeping the change somewhat bloodless. Within a lyric, textural mode, though, the progression is coherent and satisfying.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The submerged city’s forgotten library, deep archives, and candlelit blackout are rendered with strong sensory focus and a consistent, somber tone that matches Mira’s mindset. Setting is not postcard-only: the blackout and deep-archive stillness directly alter how she works and what she can see, and the “reclaimed stillness” motif returns to charge the ending. Details like the false panel and the weighty quiet feel specific and inhabited. This is rich, purposeful atmosphere that meaningfully supports theme and action, just shy of the very top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake is the preservation and recognition of suppressed truth, and it does sharpen as Mira moves from passive cataloging to active complicity with the hidden archive. The main “tightening” is cognitive—realizing the marginalia are deliberate testimony and that her inherited tools tie her to that lineage—rather than any external threat. As a result, pressure remains low-intensity and largely internal; there’s little sense of concrete risk or an option she might realistically refuse. It works for a quiet literary piece, but escalation and cost could be more viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story’s thematic throughline—truth preserved in margins, bureaucracy as both suppressor and secret shelter, silence as a medium of resistance—is coherent and grows organically from particular images (ink stamp, marginalia, submerged city, blackout). The founders’ cunning and the idea of a “secondary archive within the primary one” give the theme specificity beyond generic “truth will out” platitudes. Some sentences edge toward explicit thesis (“The library was not simply a repository…”), which slightly flattens subtext. Still, the final resolve to annotate the margins of history offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The third-person-limited voice is controlled, with a calm, intellectual register that aligns with Mira’s methodical temperament and the piece’s contemplative mode. Rhythm and diction generally feel intentional and polished, and the focalization remains stable. Minor glitches (“construct alternatif hypothesis,” “official文字”) nick the illusion of complete mastery and add a faint sense of artifact rather than character-specific lexicon. Overall, the perceptual signature is distinct but could be fractionally tighter and cleaner to reach top-tier.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose is dense but mostly disciplined, with images doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (sediment, water through stone, reclaimed stillness). Sentences vary in length and carry momentum despite the reflective mode, and there’s little true scaffolding or repetition. Occasional phrasing issues and slightly abstract formulations (“tranquilly perceptive in the way that long practice creates”) keep it from feeling utterly knife-sharp. A light line edit would likely make this fully publication-ready at a high level.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The combination of a sunken city archive, bureaucratic marginalia as a covert truth archive, and an almost religious treatment of an ink stamp as sigil feels fresh and thoughtfully integrated. The premise—truth hidden within the machinery of record-keeping itself—moves beyond standard “secret library” tropes via its focus on marginal notes and administrative tools. While the emotional arc (quiet discovery → commitment) is familiar, the textural and conceptual framing give it distinctiveness. It’s an original, if not radically experimental, synthesis.</comment>
