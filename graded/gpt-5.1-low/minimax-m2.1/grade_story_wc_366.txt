<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Maren is sharply etched—reticent, observant, carrying inherited grief—and her actions (reading the stones, offering the sea glass, stacking her own cairn) align cleanly with those traits. Her internal conflict (duty vs. unarticulated mourning) is present but relatively smooth, with little real resistance or ambiguity at the peak choice. Ashford is thin but functional as a pressure source and lore-bearer. The final shift toward purpose feels earned, if a touch tidy for elite-level nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal chain is clear and satisfying: dark lamp → evacuation → stone stacks → revelation of anonymous tradition and ship graveyard → Maren’s ritual act → light restored. Orientation is clean from the opening, and the single-scene structure with brief backstory interleaving supports the throughline. The closure—a decisive change in the world state and Maren’s role—is on-page and legible with emotional cost (letting go of her grandmother’s unresolved presence). The only softness is how quickly Maren “immediately” grasps what is needed, which trims some potential struggle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lighthouse, sea, fog, dock, and lantern room are vivid and filtered through Maren’s practiced eye, avoiding generic atmosphere. Environmental specifics (currents, barnacles, gulls, stored letters in the walls, the ghost-heat of the lamp, feverish stones) all build a coherent, tactile world. The lantern room and sea glass function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice and charge the final act and image. Weather and sea history subtly pressure the stakes without over-explaining systems.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stakes—whether the haunted, mourning lighthouse will resume guiding ships and whether the dead will be acknowledged—are clear and emotionally grounded. Pressure escalates from eerie stone stacks to a spiritual/ethical imperative once the letters and ship graveyard are revealed. However, Maren encounters little real resistance (internal or external) once she understands what’s happening; there’s no significant risk of failure or competing demand, so the climax feels gentle rather than taut. The resolution is earned but low-friction for a piece aiming at top-tier intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of remembrance, mourning, intergenerational duty, and nonverbal communication emerge organically from the stone stacks, letters, and sea glass rather than overt moralizing. The notion of the lighthouse “remembering its dead” and refusing to function until the loss is witnessed is a potent, quietly original ethical frame. Maren’s final act—“bottling” safety as an offering—reweights her job from logistics to spiritual stewardship. A few lines verge on explicit thesis-statement territory, but they remain grounded in concrete image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and distinctly tuned to a taciturn seafarer whose attention is attuned to currents, weather, and small shifts. Lyric touches (“fog bank that rolled in like a breathing thing,” “luminescent ache”) feel consistent with the established register rather than pasted on. POV is cleanly anchored in Maren without leakage, and modulation at the end into a slightly more luminous register suits the earned peace. There is enough rhythmic and lexical variety to avoid a generic workshop voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is tight, rhythmically controlled, and information-dense; most sentences do at least two jobs (setting, character, tone) without padding. Figurative language is present but measured and coherent, with no mixed metaphors or purple excess that obscure sense. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding phrases, or copy-edit issues, and the final image is clean and strong. At elite level one might want an occasional sharper, more idiosyncratic turn of phrase, but nothing here drags momentum or muddies clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Haunted lighthouses and sea-bound grief are familiar territory, but the anonymous stone-message tradition and the idea of the lighthouse itself mourning and demanding acknowledgment give the premise a fresh inflection. The sea glass as inherited “unfinished business” that becomes an offering is a specific, memorable choice. Structural and thematic moves are strong rather than startling; the story doesn’t take major formal risks but executes its concept with sincerity and craft. It feels distinctive enough to stand out, though not radically inventive.</comment>
