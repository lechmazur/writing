<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kira’s interiority is specific and coherent, with her vocation and the shard-linked wound shaping how she thinks and feels. Her motivation—to understand what happened to her mentor and to herself—is clear and sustained, and the final repricing (“not peace, but purpose”) feels earned. Internal conflict exists (gift vs. wound, escape vs. acceptance) but rarely surfaces as sharp, simultaneous impulses inside a single beat. The cost of her final stance is more implied than viscerally felt on the page, which keeps this just short of top tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece holds a clean single-scene structure with an accumulative/casual hybrid drive: climb, activation, vision, repricing, descent. Orientation is solid early, and all the speculative elements cohere without rule-breaking or retroactive patches. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: she doesn’t alter the multiverse but redefines her role in it, with a clear before/after. The cost—accepting an unhealed wound and endless liminality—could be made more concrete, but it is legible enough to satisfy closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The abandoned repair bay is vivid and particular (the crane, the empty cradle, the humming silence) and nicely mirrors the liminal, haunted emotional landscape. Details are filtered through her sensory-cartography lens, which gives the setting a distinct texture. The environment provides a plausible interface (the crane’s control panel) but doesn’t strongly constrain her options beyond atmosphere and access. Still, it consistently supports tone and concept rather than feeling like a generic SF backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether she can change the outcome / redirect the flow versus facing the true nature of her wound—is clear and escalates as she moves from seeking her mentor’s answer to realizing she herself is the source of the pattern. The activation of the shard and vision of her alternate self provide a meaningful tightening in knowledge. However, the conflict stays largely contemplative and never quite forces a hard on-page trade-off or visible forfeiture. Tension is steady and coherent but not especially cutting at the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme around gift vs. wound, liminality, and the cost of perception emerges organically from the shard, her profession, and the multiverse structure. The final realization that she’s been withholding the truth from herself and that her “ability” is a permanent seam carries real thematic weight. Some formulations edge toward explicit thesis statements (“The truth she sought was not…”), slightly reducing subtlety. Even so, the ending image of purpose-in-burden rather than neat solace offers a resonant, non-trivial answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and distinctively attuned to impressions and emotional residues rather than hard tech. Diction and syntax suit a reflective, slightly lyrical SF mode, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. Occasional abstraction clusters (“weight of this truth,” “vast architecture of parallel universes”) risk smoothing the voice into generalized loftiness but mostly stay anchored by concrete images like the shard and crane. Overall, the perceptual signature is clear and character-appropriate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is generally strong: varied sentence rhythm, clean syntax, and multi-tasking sentences that build world, mood, and character at once. Phrases like “the membrane between worlds,” “murmur of half-remembered dreams,” and “particular quality of longing” are evocative without tipping into pure purple. There is some repetition of key abstractions (“weight,” “membrane,” “murmur of half-remembered dreams”) and abstract-noun densities in the final third that slightly blunt impact. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are preserved, and no major scaffolding or loops appear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The fusion of a “sensory map maker” who charts emotional residues with multiverse travel via a green shard is a fresh, specific spin on familiar parallel-universe motifs. The twist that she has been leading the shard, not the other way around, and that her power is a wound rather than a gift, feels organically earned. While the broad frame (abandoned spaceport + interdimensional contact) is recognizable SF territory, the emotional and vocational particulars keep it from feeling generic. A slightly sharper, more idiosyncratic on-page cost would push this into a more unmistakably singular register.</comment>
