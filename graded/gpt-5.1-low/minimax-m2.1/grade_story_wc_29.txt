<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya’s vocation, competence, and sense of duty are clear and consistent, and her micro-choices—staying up all night, risking the equipment—track logically with those traits. However, she encounters little genuine internal friction or doubt; once she identifies the problem, the path forward is essentially linear. Emotional textures skew abstract (“cautiously hopeful,” “ethereal grit”) rather than embodied in specific, character-particular sensations. The ending shift from hopeful to “steadier and more resilient” is plausible but feels somewhat declared rather than earned through visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The causal spine is clean: she detects anomalous frequencies, deduces their source, calculates a counter-signal, and broadcasts it, leading to a change in campus behavior. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph; we always know who, where, and roughly when we are. Closure lands as a decisive change—the manipulation is disrupted and Maya’s ongoing role is established—but the lack of obstacles or complications makes the arc feel slightly schematic. The cost of success (beyond lost sleep and risk to equipment) is underplayed, which limits the structural punch.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The university radio station and its “ancient equipment” offer a solid, tactile frame, and the protests outside add atmospheric pressure. Technical elements like the transmission array and antenna integrate with Maya’s actions rather than sitting as window dressing. However, the setting is mostly conveyed through summary and generalities; sensory detail beyond sound and a few visual cues is sparse. The environment does constrain tactics (she must use this station and its charts), but it could do more texturally and spatially to shape the moment-to-moment experience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the campus will remain hijacked by divisive cosmic manipulation—is clear and scaled appropriately. Yet the pressure line is relatively flat: once Maya understands the interference, there are no serious setbacks, moral tradeoffs, or visible near-failures; her countermeasure works on the first try. The “too gentle/too aggressive” calibration risk is mentioned but never dramatized as a real test. As a result, the conflict reads more like an elegant puzzle than a tightening noose, and the final victory feels low-cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Themes of media manipulation, agency versus engineered discord, and the ethics of interference emerge organically from the premise. The choice to restore normal conflict rather than impose harmony is a smart, nuanced thematic move. However, the final paragraphs tend toward thesis-style articulation (“The cosmos was full of entities who wished to play games with mortal minds…”) instead of letting image and implication carry the weight. Subtext exists but is often surfaced as direct statement rather than left to resonate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is steady and coherent, with a mild, thoughtful lyricism that fits a trained listener attuned to “spaces between stars.” Diction occasionally drifts into the abstract or explanatory, but it remains plausible for an academically trained specialist. Expository passages about tricksters and subsonic frequencies are clear, though at times they read more like a narrated lecture than embodied perception. Overall, POV control is strong and stable, if a touch more informative than lived-in.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and easy to follow, with a few striking phrases (“ethereal grit,” “a crop of chaos being cultivated”). Sentences carry information efficiently without obvious syntactic tics or loops, and paragraphing supports the story’s beats. That said, there is a reliance on abstract nouns (frequencies, resonances, manipulation) and conceptual description where a few more concrete, scene-level images could heighten immediacy. The line-level work is solid and publishable but not yet distinctive enough for the highest tier.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fusion of campus radio, celestial signal interpretation, and ancient cosmic tricksters weaponizing subsonic frequencies is an appealing and relatively fresh synthesis. The idea of counter-broadcasting to disrupt engineered discord via a university station is particularly strong. Execution tends toward straightforward explanation rather than formally or emotionally risky choices that might fully exploit the premise’s strangeness. It feels like an original world with room to deepen rather than a generic re-skin, but it stops short of truly surprising turns.</comment>
