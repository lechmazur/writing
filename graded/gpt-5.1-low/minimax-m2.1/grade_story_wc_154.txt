<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elira is sharply etched through occupation, bodily awareness, and her ethic of translation as witness; her decision to take on Fatima’s story while still anesthetized feels both consistent and costly. The 'shrewdly innocent' trait is not just labeled but borne out in how she reads the cast while clinging to hope that meaning can be recovered. Internal contradiction is present but quiet—pain and reluctance coexisting with professional reflex—so her arc is more modulation than turn. Secondary characters (Fatima, grandmother, Dr. Okonkwo) are sketched efficiently, though the emotional dynamic with Dr. Okonkwo remains largely functional rather than pressurized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The structure is clean: Dr. Okonkwo’s request leads to the translation sequence, which culminates in connection with Fatima and the grandmother, then resolves in Elira’s reflective choice about the cast. Causality is intact under an accumulative/textural lens—the pressure is in what’s revealed, not in physical jeopardy—and the closure (Elira deciding to return the cast, holding the coral) reconfigures the frame from medical scene to shared memorial. Orientation is clear from the outset (who/where/when) with no temporal or spatial stumbles. The only limit is that the global drive remains fairly low-key, with no major structural surprise or turn beyond the expected revelation and emotional release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium, amber lights, and medical setting are vivid and sensorially grounded, and they evolve appropriately as twilight deepens. Details are filtered through Elira’s state—the softened edges from anesthesia, the 'eternal, misty embrace'—giving the environment a subjective charge. The coral fragment functions as a micro-setting object, returning at the end to embody the theme of damage accreting into structure. While the setting doesn’t overtly constrain decision-paths, it strongly shapes tone and the final image, which is enough at this length.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake is emotional and ethical: whether Elira will, and can bear to, reconstruct Fatima’s trauma via translation. Pressure rises as she moves from reading benign messages to decoding the Wolof, then hits its peak in voicing the bus sequence and the three-day orange sky, with Fatima’s touch confirming the cost and necessity. The external conflict is minimal and there’s no sharp reversal; escalation is a deepening of witness rather than a narrowing of options. That keeps the stakes a bit soft for top-tier scores, though the internal endurance choice lands credibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme is rich: translation as an act of witnessing, the ethics of reconstructing trauma, and the metaphor of bodies and coral turning injury into structure. The child’s cast as layered text (adult platitudes over a child’s urgent etchings) elegantly stages 'grafting new meaning onto old wounds' without sermonizing. Lines like 'translating silence into testimony' flirt with explicitness but stay grounded in the concrete situation. The final gesture—returning the cast, feeling its ridges as shared grief—offers a resonant, non-literal answer about what humane repair can and cannot do.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Elira’s educated, reflective sensibility. Diction and rhythm are carefully tuned ('vernacular of shrapnel and healing bone') without slipping into an implausible register for her background. Dialogue is sparse but natural, serving to frame the central task without expository awkwardness. Psychic distance tightens appropriately around peak beats (the pause at 'Amara—'), giving the voice emotional flex rather than monotone poetics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is elegant and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty in scene-setting and thematic work; there is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and coherent ('blue dust on the road,' 'lotus-hearted and ancient'), and rhythm varies well across longer and shorter lines. A few phrases verge on lush ('terrible poetry,' 'eternal, misty embrace') but they don’t obscure clarity or dull the closure image. Syntax, grammar, and sequencing are clean, supporting momentum despite the contemplative mode.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The combination of a conflict-zone translator in recovery, a child’s annotated cast as multilingual palimpsest, and the brain-coral motif feels distinctive and thematically integrated. Trauma-witness narratives and medical-lyric settings are familiar territory, but the specific angle of decrypting smudged Wolof notes in a hospital atrium is fresh. The idea of translation as reconstructive reef-building is an inventive synthesis rather than a genre template maneuver. The piece takes a quiet, risk-embracing path (no sensational plot twist), relying on conceptual ingenuity and emotional specificity instead.</comment>
