<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s inner life and motives are clear, specific, and grounded in her craft and history with her 师傅, and the discovery of his letters gives her final choice emotional weight. The calligrapher detail feels fully inhabited rather than decorative. However, her internal conflict around honesty versus “survival untruths” is more stated than dramatized—she never visibly hesitates or pays a concrete price for choosing candor, which softens the felt cost of her final act. The师傅 relationship is powerful but entirely retrospective, limiting on-page relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: zinc plate and map → investigation → coordinates → journey → hidden letter-room → decision to continue the work, with a clear before/after in Mira’s understanding of her师傅 and honesty. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and never confusing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the room’s meaning shifts from secret cache to living garden of truth when she begins to write. The main weakness is that the structural arc is almost purely investigative with no significant complication or reversal once the trail is found.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse city under a toxic sky is vividly and economically rendered, with details like children carving tunnels through abandoned growing halls and succulents “that had learned to survive on memory of water” doing strong double duty for mood and theme. Setting stays tightly inside Mira’s sensibility as a calligrapher and apprentice, never lapsing into tourist catalog. The environment doesn’t quite force tactical choices in-scene, but it does credibly explain the existence of the letter room and the culture of rationed lies. The final garden image, transforming the letter-room via gold leaf and candlelight, powerfully repurposes earlier environmental motifs.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether and how Mira engages with this hidden reservoir of honesty—is coherent and sharpened by the师傅 backstory. The story tightens once she deciphers the coordinates and enters the room, where she must decide between passive witnessing and active continuation. However, her journey is almost frictionless: the tunnels pose no danger, no one opposes her, and internal resistance is minimal, so escalation is more a gentle deepening than true pressure. The cost of her choice (social, personal, or practical) is implied but not concretely felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of candor in a world that survives on “rationing lies” is strongly embodied in the calligraphy, the postal plate, the unsent letters, and the师傅’s muteness, with “where lost conversations go” serving as an effective thematic hinge. The final image of the room becoming a garden again through gold leaf is a resonant, non-literal answer about truth as cultivation and inheritance. That said, a few lines verge on essayistic (“not a path to wealth, but a pilgrimage to honesty”), spelling out what the images already convey. The complexity is more lyrical than morally knotty—there’s little sense of the genuine harm that candor might do in this world.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, textured, and clearly Mira’s, with diction shaped by her craft and world (“metal’s memory,” “gilded-leaf calligrapher,” “gold her commitment to permanence”). Rhythm and sentence length are varied and purposeful, sustaining a lyrical tone without sliding into murk or abstraction. There is no head-hopping, and exposition is embedded smoothly in perception and action. The voice could, in an elite context, risk slightly more idiosyncrasy or abrasion to cut against the lyricism at moments of pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prose is polished and musical, with strong information density—most sentences advance both atmosphere and character stance. Figurative language is frequent but generally controlled and coherent; metaphors like “dust that had forgotten how to be soil” and the room as a garden feel earned rather than decorative. There is little sign of paraphrase loops or scaffolding, and syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. A few phrases tread close to familiar lyric territory (“something new was beginning to grow”), but they don’t significantly blunt the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-collapse greenhouse city, gold-leaf calligraphy, and a hidden archive of unsent letters as a pilgrimage to honesty feels fresh and specific rather than templated. The zinc postal plate as map to “where lost conversations go” and the师傅’s silent collapse under rationed lies give the premise a distinct emotional and conceptual angle. The final reconfiguration of the letter room into a renewed garden via her craft is an elegant, non-obvious turn. There’s room to push further into risk—particularly in dramatizing the dangers of candor—but the piece already rises above most genre and workshop defaults.</comment>
