<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s vocation, inheritance, and solitude are clear and character-specific, and her quiet dedication feels credible. However, her interior conflict is muted; we don’t see much tension between competing impulses, only steady purpose. The emotional shift from isolation to connection at the end is earned but subtle, with limited dramatized cost. Ashworth functions more as an off-page echo than a crucible relationship, which keeps characterization somewhat cool.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece follows a clean, single-scene structure: entry → discovery of diaries → methodical decoding → revelation of Ashworth’s chart → reframed sense of legacy. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, and closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration of Mira’s burden and the building’s “dreams.” Stakes and cost remain conceptual rather than sharply dramatized, which keeps the arc from feeling fully decisive. Still, the narrative never loses orientation and arrives at a clear before/after in Mira’s stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is rich and integrated: ivy-veiled corridors, drowned coasts, cold air, and ash-filled fireplaces all feel tactile and filtered through Mira’s vocation. The building as a dreaming, decaying organism is vividly rendered and thematically aligned with memory and echoes. Environment doesn’t strongly constrain concrete choices, but it deeply charges the final image (ivy as audience; walls dreaming aloud). Detail selection is economical and avoids generic climate-apocalypse shorthand.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—salvaging and interpreting vanishing echoes/diaries before they dissolve—is clear but mostly intellectual and atmospheric. Pressure modestly tightens through the damage to the diaries and fading light, culminating in the partial recovery of Ashworth’s chart. There’s little in the way of direct opposition or hard trade-offs; Mira’s success costs her mainly a deeper acceptance of the burden rather than a visible sacrifice. As a result, conflict feels gently textured rather than truly escalated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Legacy, memory, and the question of what spaces “dream” are woven through objects (lenses, charts, diaries) and closure rather than stapled on. The intergenerational handoff from grandmother to Mira to Ashworth and onward gives the final realization about burden-as-continuation honest weight. A few lines verge on thesis-statement clarity (“The legacy’s burden was not a weight but a continuation”), slightly flattening the subtext. Nonetheless, the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question that lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The third-person-limited voice is consistent, with lyrical yet controlled diction that fits Mira’s observational, archival mindset. Sentences modulate rhythm well between broad scene-setting and the close work of examining diaries. Apart from a minor register/glitch (“他的记录的”), which jars slightly, the narrative stance feels confident and unified. The perceptual signature (walls dreaming, corridors breathing, ivy as audience) is distinct and sustained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and usually carry multiple functions (setting, emotion, theme) without slipping into bloat. Figurative language is frequent but mostly apt and not confusing; only occasionally does it approach purple without adding pressure. There are no major scaffold loops or redundancy that sap momentum in this quiet mode. A small language error aside, prose is polished and nearly publication-ready.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise of a “corridor echo cartographer” mapping residual whispers in a post-climate-shift university is genuinely fresh. Combining spectral architectural memory with climate-collapse ruins and archival tools (film negatives, diaries) produces a distinctive synthesis. The diary-as-portal device is somewhat familiar, but here it’s re-inflected by the walls’ own “dreaming” and inherited craft. The piece feels like a particular vision rather than a re-skin of a template.</comment>
