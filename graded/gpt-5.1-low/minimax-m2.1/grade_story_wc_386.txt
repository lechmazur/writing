<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motive—salvaging a pure memory and giving the child back her name—is clear and consistent, but largely asserted rather than pressured on the page. Her interiority is textured in mood yet rarely contradictory; we don’t see competing impulses or a difficult trade-off, only serene commitment. Micro-choices (diving the wreck, tending the shrine, deciding to find the relatives) are all aligned and cost-light. The net effect is a strong atmosphere of purpose without the sharper edges of character under strain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The accumulative structure is coherent: shrine → wreck and globe → dream investigation → resolved purpose to restore the child’s name and find her family. Causality is clean within a lyric mode, with the snow globe and recurring dream-face motivating her inquiry. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the investigation has crystallized into a clear next step with moral weight, even if the decisive external act is deferred. The main limitation is that this feels like a prologue to a larger narrative rather than a self-contained arc with a felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The glacier shrine, candlelight, and wreck imagery are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through her vocation, creating a strong, coherent atmosphere. The snow globe, candles, ice, and “borrowed starlight” recur meaningfully and charge the final moments. The environment shapes tone more than tactical choice; she could arguably do similar work in a different sacred space without much mechanical change. Still, the setting feels integral to the story’s identity and to the emotional resonance of the ending image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes revolve around whether the child’s fragmented, haunting presence in strangers’ dreams will be given coherent remembrance, which is conceptually rich but dramatically under-pressured. There is no substantive opposition to her goal—no resisting force, time pressure, or ethical dilemma that tests her commitment. Escalation comes mainly as accumulating information (identifying the girl, tracing the mother) rather than tightening options or raising visible cost. As a result, tension remains low and the climax reads more like a gentle thematic reveal than a pressured turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Themes of memory, grief diffusion, and ethical salvage (“to salvage something pure from the wreckage”) emerge organically from the dreams, the wreck, and the shrine without overt sermonizing. The child’s repeated presence in strangers’ dreams as a dispersed ghost of communal loss is a strong thematic engine. The ending offers a quiet but resonant answer: meaning is restored by deliberate, careful remembering and reconnection. The relative absence of on-page struggle or ethical friction keeps the thematic field more elegiac than complex.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly patterned, with recurring diction around light, cold, and preservation that gives it a recognizable texture. Distance hovers in a close-omniscient mode that suits the mythic tone, with no head-hopping or stance breaks. Rhythm and sentence structure are controlled, with enough variation to avoid monotony while sustaining a meditative cadence. At times the narration feels more authorially elevated than character-particular, but it maintains internal consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is generally polished and economical for a lyric mode: metaphors (glacier as vault, wreck as cathedral ribs, memories as snow) are controlled and coherent. Sentences often do double duty, conveying world, mood, and premise without obvious scaffolding or repetition. There’s a mild density of figurative language, but it’s pattern-consistent rather than purple to the point of obscurity, and momentum is preserved in a reflective register. No significant loops or artifacts blunt the closure image of the melting globe yielding its last secrets.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a wreck-diver “ghost-whisperer” reconstructing a drowned child via strangers’ dream cameos inside a glacial candle shrine feels genuinely fresh. The dream-network as a medium of communal grief and memory is an interesting conceptual twist on haunting. While the narrative arc itself (investigation → clarity → vow to act) is conventional, the method, imagery, and emotional register distinguish it from template ghost stories. Greater on-page conflict or a more surprising final re-weighting could have pushed the ingenuity even higher.</comment>
