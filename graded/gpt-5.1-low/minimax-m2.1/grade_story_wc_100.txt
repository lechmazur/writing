<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Aldric is sharply etched as a weary, old-school undertaker with a palpable ache and vocation, and his professionalism colors how he meets the supernatural call. His choices (opening the box, accepting the souls’ needs, deciding to wait by the window) are motivated and coherent. However, his internal conflict is underplayed—he moves from fatigue to acceptance with little visible resistance or contradictory impulse on the page, which keeps his change from feeling fully hard-won.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean and legible: package → lens → portal → soul work → new vocation, with one elegant scene break into the underwater library. Closure is solid, with a clear before/after in his purpose and the lens’s function, and the story sustains one dominant drive. The cost of this shift (what he gives up in returning to a life that will now be interrupted by calls) is only lightly implied, so the ending feels more comfortably resolved than deeply paid for.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The settings—the modest house on Pemberton Street and the drowned library-city—are vivid, specific, and tonally unified; details like bookshelves “like ribs” and sand that smells of salt do real atmospheric work. The lighthouse lens as object-setting recurs and meaningfully charges the final image. The underwater environment, however, rarely constrains his options or behavior (no real sense of physical risk or limitation), which keeps it from fully integrating with character choice at the highest level.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The primary stake is Aldric’s faltering sense of vocation versus the souls’ need for guidance; the arrival of the package tightens this neatly by presenting a clear call. There is one meaningful deepening as he moves from undertaker of bodies to undertaker of lost souls and the lens repairs in tandem, but direct opposition or real dilemma is muted—he never seriously considers refusing or failing. As a result, escalation is more a gentle unfolding than a pressured narrowing of options, and the price he pays remains mostly conceptual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of vocation, care for the dead, and what it means to give “rest a permanent address” emerge organically from Aldric’s profession and the lighthouse lens’s transformation from maritime to spiritual beacon. The knitting lens and the final quiet vigil by the window provide a resonant non-literal answer about purpose and stillness. Some thematic lines (“a lighthouse lens that worked not for ships at sea but for souls at rest”) skate close to explicative, but they are grounded enough in concrete story to avoid outright moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The third-person-limited voice is consistent, measured, and gently lyrical, matching Aldric’s temperament and the funereal subject matter. Diction and rhythm are controlled without calling attention to themselves, and interior access is stable with no head-hopping. The narration leans somewhat toward an omniscient-literary register rather than a strongly idiosyncratic Aldric filter, which slightly blurs the “perceptual signature” at peak moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and dense with meaningful images that do more than one job—establishing mood, character, and world in the same strokes. There are no evident loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddles, and the syntax supports momentum despite the reflective tone. A few metaphors approach the familiar “literary” register without subversion, but they don’t bog clarity or undercut the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The combination of an undertaker protagonist, a broken lighthouse lens as psychopomp beacon, and a forgotten underwater library is fresh and memorable even though each component nods to existing fantasy traditions. The twist from maritime distress signal to spiritual rescue device is conceptually neat and thematically aligned. The conflict path itself (reluctant specialist discovers renewed purpose via one magical intervention) is familiar and played fairly safely, limiting the sense of bold risk.</comment>
