<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira is clearly motivated—to learn the lighthouse’s “song” and help the ships—and her internal process in the climactic jasmine scene is specific and embodied. The grandmother/Thessaly lineage gives her desire texture without over-explaining. However, her internal conflict is relatively low-friction: there’s little sense of doubt, fear of failure, or competing impulses under pressure, which softens the cost of her choice. A slightly more resistant or self-divided reaction to the responsibility of tending the light alone would deepen characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The structure is clean: heat wave → night garden opening → Thessaly’s absence and the box → Mira’s decision to use vibrations of intent → ships turning → logbook coda. Causality is coherent and the closure lands via a clear before/after—Mira tests the logbook method and confirms “the whispers were right,” which reconfigures the premise. The drive lens feels Hybrid (causal events with an accumulative lyric charge), and that holds consistently. The main limitation is that the “moment felt right” trigger for opening the box is a bit soft, underplaying the sense of a single, sharply defined turning point.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the cobalt lighthouse, bruised clouds, fevered stone steps, and the night garden all feel lived-in and sensorially rich. Environmental details (heat wave, thermal currents, protected hollow, salt-worn granite) are integrated into the stakes for ships and the availability of jasmine, rather than feeling like postcard description. The lighthouse, lens, and scent concretely mediate her action, so the environment does constrain and enable choices. It stops short of a 9-band only because at the final image the setting is more lyrical than pressuring; the sense of ongoing cost/constraint there is comparatively gentle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Mira can guide endangered ships when standard methods falter—is established clearly and tightened when we learn thermal currents have made the beacon unreliable. Pressure escalates as she chooses an untested, more mystical method, with her hands on the lens and ships “fighting treacherous currents.” That said, her attempt meets no palpable resistance; the act of sending intention succeeds almost immediately, with little sense of risk, potential backlash, or partial failure. The conflict is thus more contemplative than harrowing, effective but not maximally sharpened.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece has a coherent and appealing thematic spine about quiet, pure intention (“whispers”) being more effective than frantic spectacle (“shouts”), expressed through concrete maritime and sensory particulars. The jasmine, night garden, and the vibrational “song” of the lighthouse give this theme an image system rather than abstract moralizing, and the final line about “the night the darkness had answered them back” offers a resonant conceptual reweighting. However, the logbook line “The whispers were right. They always are.” edges toward explicit thesis-statement, slightly flattening the otherwise well-earned subtext. More ambiguity about costs—e.g., what is lost when one abandons shouts—could heighten the lingering complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a lyrical but not overwrought register that fits Mira’s sensibility and the quasi-mystical premise. Phrasings like “flares bursting like wounded stars” and “screaming tenderness of her belief” create a distinct texture and perceptual signature. The narration stays within what Mira can infer, without unmotivated omniscience, and psychic distance is steady. A small portion of diction (“verbal equivalent of grasping hands”) leans toward essayistic abstraction, but it doesn’t significantly disrupt the voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is generally strong, with varied syntax, clean mechanics, and high information density—most sentences carry worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously. Metaphors are apt and mostly non-redundant; the jasmine-as-confession and heat-as-fever images are particularly effective. There is some tendency toward figurative stacking (“bruised clouds,” “wounded stars,” “screaming tenderness”) that risks purple if pushed further, but here it remains just on the lush side of controlled. I see no major loops, scaffolding, or clarity issues that impede momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The fusion of a working lighthouse with an almost esoteric practice of “vibrations of intent,” anchored by sensory details like the night garden and single drop of jasmine, feels fresh and memorable. The reimagining of a lighthouse as a device that “sings” into human hearts rather than simply flashing light is a strong conceptual twist executed with confidence. Emotional truth—about quiet care, apprenticeship, and inherited knowledge—grounds the more fantastical elements. While the arc itself is simple and largely successful, pushing further into the personal or ethical cost of wielding such power could make the ingenuity feel even more indispensable.</comment>
