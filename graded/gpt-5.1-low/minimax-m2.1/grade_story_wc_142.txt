<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s role, motives, and skillset are clear and specific—“culture shock absorber” and her use of the old language give her a distinct profile, and her tactics align well with those traits. The dual allegiance between investors and old-timers is explicitly dramatized in her choice to resist by organizing rather than lashing out. However, internal conflict is more stated than felt; she experiences little on-page wavering or irrationality under pressure. The cost she bears (“absorbed the weight of that responsibility”) is conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized, which softens the character arc’s impact.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The piece follows a clean causal line (investors arrive → Mira observes and infers threat → she decides to resurrect the code → she executes the graffiti network → community will be ready tomorrow) with good orientation in time and space. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the final image of a “living network, reorganized and ready” marks a clear before/after in options. Still, the main conflict—developers vs. community—has not yet met direct resistance on the page, so the ending leans on promised future confrontation rather than a cost-bearing turn within this scene. As a result, the structural arc feels more preparatory than fully climactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The raft-city carnival is vivid and specific—the contrast between creaking old rafts and “glass platforms gleamed like floating diamonds” grounds the socioeconomic tension in concrete space. Setting is well-filtered through Mira’s priorities (investors’ “gilded barges,” the underside of docks, food stalls, lanterns) and supports the coded-symbol system organically. While the environment doesn’t strictly constrain her choices, it meaningfully charges the imagery and the method of resistance. The recurring object-setting of the foundation stone chip nicely ties place to theme in the final paragraphs.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Verada’s communal foundations will be erased by privatization—is clear, and the impending investor return provides a mild clock. Conflict, however, stays at a conceptual simmer: investors are glimpsed but never interact, and Mira encounters no meaningful resistance or setbacks while implementing her plan. The main “tightening” is internal (deciding to act and executing the graffiti network), which does narrow options but with little visible price. Consequently, tension feels steady rather than escalating, limiting the sense of hard-won stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Themes of gentrification, communal memory vs. commerce, and encoded solidarity emerge cleanly from action and images (the dismantled Market Hall, secret symbols, canals as carriers of “merchants and memories”). The dual allegiance theme is effectively embodied in Mira’s goal to shape, not simply stop, “the inevitable tide of change.” At times the narration edges toward thesis statement—lines like “The foundation of Verada had been built by people who chose to trust each other” state ideas the imagery already implies. Even so, the final reweighting of the stone chip from relic to promise offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The third-person limited voice is controlled, with a consistent, mildly lyric texture that fits Mira’s observant, pattern-oriented mind. Phrases like “cataloging faces… mapping the geography of displacement” give her perception a distinct, analytical signature without slipping out of plausibility. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; psychic distance stays stable and appropriate. A few lines lean into generalized, familiar phrasing (“inevitable tide of change,” “bones of a community”) which slightly blunts the otherwise specific voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sentences are generally clear, well-paced, and information-dense, with few redundancies; description, interiority, and action often share lines efficiently. The prose is occasionally lush but not incoherent, and metaphors (carnival as “quiet tide” of graffiti, canals carrying “merchants and memories”) are mostly apt and consistent. There are mild tendencies toward abstraction and repetition in later paragraphs (“foundation,” “community,” “tide of change”) that could be sharpened into fresher images. No major scaffolding, template cadence, or figurative muddle interferes with closure, but there is room to trim and electrify key lines.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The raft-city perpetual carnival, combined with a hidden symbolic language embedded in decorations as an organizing tool, is a fresh and engaging synthesis. Using graffiti-like code as collective resistance to gentrification is a smart inflection of a familiar topic. The macro conflict (developers vs. community) is conventional, but the specific tools, visuals, and social infrastructure of Verada keep it from feeling generic. It stops short of a truly surprising moral or structural turn, yet demonstrates a coherent, distinctive vision well above template level.</comment>
