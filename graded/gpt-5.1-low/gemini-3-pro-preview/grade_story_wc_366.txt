<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s reticence combined with his “warmly observant” nature is rendered with concrete behavior—his silence, his attention to Thomas’s tremor, and his choice to intervene via the cairn and sea glass. His motivation “to bottle the feeling of safety” clearly drives his key action in the climax. Thomas is thinner but still legible as a young keeper on the brink of psychological collapse. Internal contradiction (Elias’s distance vs. care; Thomas’s duty vs. fear) could be pushed further on the page, but what’s here is coherent and earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The structure is clean: lamp failure → ascent → confrontation with Thomas’s breakdown → symbolic repair via stones and sea glass → departure, with a clear before/after in Thomas’s state. Causality holds under a largely accumulative/textural lens—the psychic pressure of the dark and the haunted room steadily builds to the small, decisive ritual of protection. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the room’s meaning shifts from oppressive haunt to tenuously held sanctuary, with cost implied in the constant threat of relapse and the fragility of the “ember.” The only limitation is that the mechanical problem of the lamp recedes almost entirely, leaving the external stake a bit under-integrated at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is exceptionally vivid and purposeful: the Fresnel lens stopping, the spiral stairs, the “glass-walled chamber” as trap, and the psychic weight of shipwrecks all shape mood and pressure. The haunted lantern room and storm aren’t postcard description; they crowd the characters, justify Thomas’s panic, and make Elias’s small flame feel hard-won. The sea glass as a micro-setting object literally charges the final image, coloring the room and redefining its atmosphere. A slightly broader sense of time/era or physical constraint on fixing the lamp could deepen realism but isn’t structurally necessary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—protecting Thomas’s psyche in the dangerous lull after the lamp fails—is clear and escalates as the darkness “inches closer” and Thomas admits “I can’t fix it.” The pressure is more psychological than event-driven, but the story does tighten: the dead light, the haunted room’s presence, the unstable stone stack, then Elias’s choice to intervene via the cairn and flame. The cost is subtle but present in the acknowledged ongoing threat of the night and Elias’s need to leave, trusting the small ember to suffice. Some readers may wish for a slightly sharper moment of real risk or near-loss to make the stakes feel less abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The themes of solitude, inherited coping strategies, and quiet acts of mercy emerge organically from particulars: the anonymous stone-language, the haunted accumulation of shipwrecks, and Elias’s attempt to “decant” safety for others. The sea glass gesture avoids moralizing; it functions as both practical comfort and symbolic endurance, answering the central question of how one lives with oppressive darkness without denying it. The “declaration of endurance” and the final image of a “glowing ember of safety” reweight the whole piece with a complex, bittersweet hope. A touch more moral ambiguity—Elias’s complicity in leaving Thomas or the systemic isolation—could push it even higher.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in Elias’s attention to small, telling details. Elevated diction (“psychic weight of a thousand shipwrecks,” “luminescent ache”) fits the contemplative, literary tone and doesn’t drift into alien register for this kind of narrator. POV stays stable and doesn’t leak into Thomas’s interior beyond what Elias can plausibly infer. A few abstract phrasings (“human erosion,” “psychological barriers”) edge toward essayistic, but they’re brief and mostly supported by concrete context.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is generally strong, with rich but controlled imagery (“pressing against the glass, eager to reclaim the space that the light had stolen from them”) and good rhythm; most sentences do multiple jobs. There is a consistent metaphorical density, yet it rarely tips into muddle or redundancy, and the line-level clarity of action is maintained. A few spots verge on purple or slightly repetitive thematic framing (safety, darkness, solitude are reiterated in similar language), which modestly slows momentum. Tightening 2–3 abstract sentences would sharpen impact without losing the lyric quality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The combination of a haunted lighthouse, anonymous stone-messages, and the sea-glass flame as a micro-beacon feels distinctive and conceptually integrated, not like a stock gothic scenario. Reframing “haunting” as the psychic sediment of shipwrecks and turning a supply skipper into an almost ritual guardian of fragile minds is an elegant, fresh inflection. The closing image—a soul-guiding, not ship-guiding, light—reconfigures the lighthouse trope in a non-obvious way. It’s not radically experimental structurally, but within its quiet frame it achieves a memorable, high-level originality.</comment>
