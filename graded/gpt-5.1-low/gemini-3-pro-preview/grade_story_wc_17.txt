<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s vocation and secret motive (“to discover what walls dream about”) create a clear, specific psychology, and his empathic sensitivity is shown in embodied ways (chest tightening, reading frequencies as abandonment). His shift from “professional detachedness” to “sole keeper of a crime” reads earned and gives the piece an internal arc. However, his internal conflict stays mostly implied; he doesn’t visibly wrestle with whether to expose, destroy, or carry the evidence—he simply accepts the burden. A slightly sharper on-page moral struggle at the end would deepen his characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The structure is clean and causal: corridor → acoustic reading → library → hearth → diaries → film → decision to carry them out. Orientation (who/where/when) is established quickly and never in doubt, and the professional procedure (clicker, echo map) motivates each deeper move into the ruin. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the echoes are reinterpreted as betrayal, and Elias’s role redefines from surveyor to burden-bearer with conceptual cost. The main limitation is that the final decision (to take the materials) follows naturally but without a sharpened fork in the road, so the climax feels more contemplative than pressured.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and purposeful: ivy-veiled passage, moss-muffled footsteps, roofless gray-sky library, and the preserved hearth all reinforce decay, abandonment, and memory. Details are filtered through Elias’s acoustic/empathic lens, so environment and tools (sonic emitter, clicker, ivy light) feel character-specific rather than touristic. The hearth and library concretely host the key discoveries and the ivy-filtered light charges the film-glimpse image at the end. The environment could constrain his choices a bit more (e.g., structural danger, weather) rather than functioning primarily as atmosphere and container.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering and then choosing how to bear the building’s traumatic history—is coherent and escalates as the echo heaviness leads to the diaries and finally the faces on the film. The moral horror of sealing people into the vaults sharpens the stakes conceptually, and the revelation that the resonance is betrayal reweights the entire exploration. However, on-page conflict is mostly informational and internal; Elias isn’t forced into a hard tactical or ethical trade-off beyond accepting knowledge. The pressure tightens once but never quite corners him into a visible, costly dilemma at the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: preservation vs. sacrifice, the burden of inherited atrocities, and the idea that places retain emotional resonance. The motif of echoes and “what walls dream about” culminates in the final recognition that the building’s dream is a “tragic nightmare” of betrayal, which reweights the entire piece without overt moralizing. Elias’s choice to carry the diaries and film out literalizes the “legacy’s burden” in a concrete act. There’s a touch of explicit phrasing (“legacy’s burden,” “sole keeper of a crime”) that edges toward stating the thesis, but it doesn’t collapse into sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The third-person limited voice is stable and distinctly colored by Elias’s acoustic/empathic sensibility; metaphors and observations consistently arise from sound, ruin, and masonry. Diction is elevated but coherent with the reflective, literary tone and the character’s contemplative mindset. Psychic distance is well controlled, slipping closer for embodied reactions and pulling back for broader reflections on the storms and profession without feeling like authorial intrusion. The only reason this doesn’t push higher is that the voice remains fairly uniform emotionally; it modulates in gravity but not dramatically in rhythm under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is polished, with strong imagery (“complex visual topography of sound,” “screamed of hidden history”) and generally efficient sentences that do multiple jobs—advancing action, mood, and theme at once. There is some density of figurative language, but it stays coherent and doesn’t tangle meaning or slow momentum appreciably at this length. Redundancy is minimal, and the syntax varies enough to avoid a mechanical cadence. To reach the very top tier, a few slightly abstract formulations (“frequency of abandonment,” “emotional resonance”) could be grounded more in concrete sensory experience in the climactic beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The corridor echo cartographer in a post–climate-shift ruin with empathic sensitivity to walls is a fresh, memorable angle on ruin exploration and memory. The fusion of sonic mapping, climate fiction, and the moral horror of archives preserved by sacrificing archivists feels like a non-obvious but coherent synthesis. The film negative of the sacrificed staff toasting in the same room adds an effective, specific twist on “foundation of survival” that deepens rather than cheapens the premise. It stops short of radically surprising structure or stakes, but within a conventional frame, the conceptual originality is high.</comment>
