<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is rich, specific, and plausibly tied to his history as a translator; his compulsion to “translate” the cast into something gentler is well motivated and earned. The embodied details (finger on coral, trembling hand with pen) keep emotions grounded. Internal conflict does exist—his trauma and guilt versus his wish to protect Leo—but it stays relatively smooth, without much visible friction or self-deception. The final act of rewriting is credible and costs him emotionally, but the cost remains implied rather than sharply dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The causal/accumulative structure is coherent: anesthetic → solitude with the cast → decoding → decision to rewrite → revised object and internal shift. Orientation is clear early on (sanatorium atrium, post-operation wait, who Leo is) and maintained throughout. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the cast’s meaning and Elias’s role as translator are reweighted, with a before/after legible in his breathing and readiness. Stakes are modest and entirely internal, but the piece delivers the promised turn without structural slippage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sanatorium atrium, saline mist, and ocean are vividly evoked and consistently filtered through Elias’s perception, giving the scene a strong, unified atmosphere. The brain coral functions as micro-setting/recurring object, charging the final image and concretizing his mental state. Environmental details (mist against glass, hum of filtration) mirror and modulate the emotional temperature without feeling like a tourist catalog. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain choices, but it effectively frames and deepens the internal action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Elias can transform a war-marked artifact into something gentler before Leo wakes—is clear and coheres with his psychological need. Pressure escalates mainly through deepening: from passive handling of the cast to recognizing the mother’s warning to the ethically loaded choice to overwrite it. The internal conflict around changing someone else’s inscription is understated; he moves fairly smoothly to his solution, with limited sense that other paths are truly live and foreclosed. Still, the decision to alter the message and its emotional cost provide enough tightening for this quiet form.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme—translation as an act of care, and the possibility of rewriting trauma’s “text”—emerges organically from specifics (Leo’s cast, the code-switch from warning to lullaby, the coral’s maze). The notion of shared anxieties inscribed on the boy’s cast is powerful and well dramatized rather than merely asserted. Some phrases verge on overt statement (“lotus-hearted ache,” “symbolically cleansing the memory”) and lightly explain what the images already show. Nonetheless, the ending’s reconfiguration of mist, coral, and cast yields a resonant, non-literal answer about how war memory might be softened without denial.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is stable and distinct, blending professional precision (codebreaker, dialect recognition) with lyrical observation in a way that feels character-appropriate. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with sentences modulating length and intensity in step with emotional shifts. There is mild register lift at times (“lotus-hearted ache,” “graft new meaning onto old wounds”) but it stays within a believable narratorial bandwidth for someone as reflective as Elias. No POV slippage or explanatory “helper narrator” intrudes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong, with a high density of images that mostly carry their weight—the heart/grenade drawing, the coral as neural maze, the mist as blanket are precise and apt. There is some drift toward purple prose and explicit thematizing (“symbolically cleansing the memory,” “un-knotted the narrative of the war”) where implication would suffice. Sentences generally do double duty (image plus psychology), and there’s little scaffolding or synonym-churn, though a few conceptual restatements could be trimmed. Rhythm and clarity remain intact through the closing beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The central conceit—an ex-war translator quietly “retranslating” a child’s cast as an act of healing—is fresh and memorable, as is the brain-coral motif bridging psyche and environment. War-trauma stories and hospital waiting rooms are familiar territory, but the specific tactic (altering dialect-script from warning to lullaby) and the focus on semiotic repair give this piece its own angle. The symbolic web (cast as palimpsest of conflict, coral as brain/objectified trauma, mist as reconfigured) is cohesive and thoughtfully developed. The risks are mostly stylistic rather than structural, but they pay off more than they falter.</comment>
