<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Reed’s motivation—to complete the arbor and bind herself and the village into a shared belonging—is clear and consistently drives her choices, especially in organizing the search despite the elders’ warning. Her interiority is mostly implied through action and image rather than deeply dramatized contradiction, which keeps her a bit cooler than she could be. The Reed/Syl mirroring via scars and craft is effective but underexplored emotionally. The final stance (not chasing Syl, accepting slow webs of kin) feels earned and in character, though the cost is gentle and could stand one sharper beat of internal friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The structure is clean: need for a dedication → discovery of the tag → decision to search → communal quest → encounter with Syl → communal completion of the arbor → quiet revaluation at the crater. Causality holds without cheats, and the accumulative pattern of tags and communal involvement builds smoothly to the closure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Reed’s understanding of belonging shifts from object/place to current/practice, with the final image of her hand on the arbor and the crater’s hum. Stakes remain modest and mostly internal, but for this length they’re coherent and resolved on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and Shimmer Crater are vivid and specific, with details like fruit that refracts light into unreadable stories and air humming with lost languages. These aren’t postcard backdrops; they shape action (the search pattern around the crater, tags on its rim, the arbor’s placement) and charge the final image when Reed presses her palm to the obsidian and feels the crater answer. The recurring environment of crystal, obsidian, and linguistic murmur tightly mirrors and supports the story’s kinship/voice themes. A touch more tactile interaction with the orchard itself during the search could push this even higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Reed (and the village) can transform the incomplete arbor into a true site of belonging—is clear and tightened by the need for a dedication and the choice to seek an elusive, possibly unwilling artist. Pressure escalates in a gentle, accumulative way: from solitary lack to communal search to the risk of confronting Syl and inscribing a collective “we.” The cost (risking rejection, Syl’s departure, Reed’s acceptance of an ongoing, unclosed web) is present but understated; there’s little concrete jeopardy or loss beyond bittersweet absence. The conflict feels authentic but never quite bites as hard as the premise allows.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of belonging, kinship as made rather than found, and the ethics of seeking vs respecting elusiveness emerge organically through the festival of grafting, the tags’ evolving messages, and the communal handprints. The shift from “I was here, and so were you” to “We are here, and so are you” to “Stay. We’ll find you.” nicely dramatizes the reconfiguration of self/other boundaries. However, the closing paragraphs edge toward explicit thesis (“belonging was not a place, but a current”), skirting mild moralizing instead of trusting the images alone. The emotional aftereffect is real but could rely a bit less on spelled-out insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The third-person voice is lyrically controlled with a distinct texture—marsh reeds, crystalline orchards, shimmering craters—yet remains clear. Focalization is mostly close to Reed with occasional village-level omniscience (the Syl ghost story) that still supports the piece’s communal emphasis rather than feeling like leakage. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying subtext in short exchanges (“You didn’t have to look” / “But we did.”). The rhythmic control is strong, though in a few spots the narration sounds slightly more like an overseeing intelligence than Reed’s exact perceptual filter, which keeps it just shy of the very highest band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The line-level work is polished: sentences are varied and musical, images are fresh (“fruit that refracts light into stories no one alive could read”), and there’s high information density without bloat. Figurative language is frequent but not purple; images are coherent with the world’s logic and thematics, and there are no evident synonym loops or scaffolding artifacts. The final paragraphs land with strong rhythm and charged callbacks (hands, hum, lost languages as invitation). One could argue for editing a couple of abstract sentences in the last block, but they don’t significantly sap momentum or clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of speculative elements (crystalline orchard, crater of lost languages, starlit obsidian arbor) with a very human story about belonging and street art feels fresh and specific. The festival of grafting and the move from anonymous tagging to communal inscription give a non-obvious, memorable twist to “found family” tropes. The final conceptual turn—belonging as current, and lost languages as invitation rather than elegy—reweights the entire world-building in satisfying hindsight. It’s bold and cohesive, though not quite so singularly strange or formally risky as to justify pushing into the rarest 9+ band.</comment>
