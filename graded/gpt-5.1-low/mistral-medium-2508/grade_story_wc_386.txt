<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lena’s characterization is vivid and specific—her patience, refusal to lie, and relationship to wreckage all emerge through action and image rather than labels. The widow is sketched efficiently but with enough particularity (palms on the altar, voice “wrong, too thick with something like hope”) to feel real. Internal contradiction exists—Lena both “let go” and clings to “the parts worth saving”—but is more implied than dramatized in on-page struggle. A slightly deeper, more contested moment around her own locket would push this closer to elite.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: supplicant arrives → ritual with the globe → revelation about the son → parallel turn to Lena’s own dead → quiet reconfiguration at the end. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of wreckage and salvage tightens toward the closing image of cracks and light, with a clear before/after in how the widow and Lena relate to their dead. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing rather than a decisive act, but the cost—choosing honest wreckage over numbing illusion—is legible. The structure is straightforward yet well-shaped for the length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The glacier shrine, candles, and snow globe create a sharply atmospheric, coherent micro-world that feels tactile and lived-in. Details like “blue veins pulsing” and the ice groaning “like a ship’s timbers” are both concrete and thematically charged without turning into a tourist catalog. The setting charges the final beats—the glacier’s “laughter,” the carved altar, the quiet of the dead—so the environment is inseparable from tone and meaning. It doesn’t strongly constrain literal tactics, but it fully anchors and colors every choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The stakes are emotional and spiritual—how the widow will understand her haunting, and how Lena lives with her own—but they are signaled early and stay coherent. Escalation comes via deepening: first the widow’s misread ghost, then the revelation of the son, then Lena risking her own memories in the same apparatus. The piece stops short of a sharp dilemma or a more explicit price; Lena’s endurance choice is powerful but not heavily contested on the page. The tension is sustained and appropriate for a quiet story, yet could climb a notch with one more pressured, non-lyric beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of grief, salvage, and finding “light” in wreckage are woven through recurring images (wrecks, air from drowned lungs, the globe, the glacier) in a largely organic way. The father dying for the toy and the idea that “not all wrecks were ships” articulate a nuanced take on what’s worth keeping. However, the ending edges into explicit thesis—“The cracks were how the light got in. And the light… was always worth the salvaging.”—which flirts with platitude and echoes a famous line, slightly flattening an otherwise rich thematic field. Less spelled-out wisdom and more trust in the existing images would elevate this significantly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The third-person limited voice through Lena is consistent, confident, and textured, with a clear perceptual signature centered on wreckage and salvage. Lyric sentences (“their voices the color of old silver,” “threads of borrowed starlight”) are controlled and modulate well with quieter declarative lines. Dialogue is sparse but natural, with the widow’s and Lena’s speech distinct in rhythm and intention. A few aphoristic turns at the end lean more authorial than character-bound, but they don’t destabilize the POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The line-level craft is strong: high information density, varied syntax, and images that usually do double duty for mood and theme. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and non-redundant; metaphors like “purest things rising… like air from a drowned man’s lungs” are visceral and on-point. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the prose carries momentum despite its lyricism. Only occasional near-aphorisms risk feeling familiar, but they don’t materially blur clarity or dull the closing image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise—a medium in an ice shrine mediating between shipwreck dead and the living—is a fresh, well-realized spin on ghostwork and grief counseling. Objects like the melted snow globe and the rusted locket, and the idea of “salvaging” parts of loss, give the story a specific imaginative texture. The main thematic twist (light through cracks, wreckage as the locus of salvation) is compelling but somewhat undercut by alluding to a widely known line about cracks and light. Overall it feels distinctive and memorable, if not radically unprecedented.</comment>
