<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lena’s motivation and professional role are sharply defined, and her choice to accept “termination” to restore the erased is credibly seeded. Interiority is specific in places (the patch warm in her palm, the numbers haunting her environment), but her inner conflict—fear vs obsession vs grief—could be layered more explicitly under pressure. The final surrender reads a bit martyr-clean, with limited on-page struggle or contradiction in that moment. Elias is effectively present as an absence and hologram, but the relationship’s emotional texture remains somewhat schematic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: anomalous request → number trail → black-box logs → hidden directory → physical server coordinates → breach and self-sacrifice, with no orientation issues. Closure is clear and costly: she triggers a mass restoration and is flagged for termination, reframing deletion as entry into the realm she’s been seeking. Some turns feel slightly convenient or compressed (her ability to unlock core systems and “pull” everything in one go, the archive’s swift unraveling). Still, the structure holds under a causal lens and the before/after is unmistakable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The archive as environment is vivid (“hummed like a dying star,” “data graves”) and consistently refracted through her job and stakes. The social network archive’s logic—redirected files, limbo directories, physical server coordinates—grounds the speculative premise without over-explaining. Recurring objects (patch, servers, data crystal) interact with the setting and charge the final image of the suddenly “silent” archive. A slightly more tactile sense of the physical server farm and her bodily environment during the breach could deepen the immediacy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—resurrecting erased lives at the cost of her own safety and complicity—is clear and escalates from curiosity to open defiance to sacrificial action. Pressure tightens plausibly via the system’s resistance and final termination notice. However, the external opposition (EchoNet as antagonist) remains largely abstract and unadaptive, and Lena encounters little real dilemma at the climax—she chooses deletion with minimal visible hesitation. The cost is conceptually high but emotionally and tactically under-contested on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Memory, erasure, and the ethics of corporate control over personal history emerge organically from action, with strong recurring motifs (numbers, songs, “unwriting,” the hidden directory name) that reweight the ending. The final conceptual flip—deletion as entry into the “place where the lost things went”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s questions about what is remembered and by whom. A few lines verge on thematic explicitness (“EchoNet didn’t just store data. It consumed it.”), nudging toward thesis-statement territory. Still, the closing images and reconfigured numbers do most of the thematic work without overt moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The third-person close voice is consistent, with a distinct techno-lyric texture and apt metaphors (“firewalls flaring like angry stars,” “ghost-light of a trillion forgotten posts”). The narrative distance stays controlled; we never leave Lena’s perceptual frame in a way that breaks POV, and the few lines of dialogue feel functional and in-tone. Occasional capitalizations and explanatory sentences slightly flatten the otherwise nimble voice. Overall, the prose stance is confident and cohesive, supporting both concept and emotion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, images are generally sharp, and most lines carry more than one layer of work (worldbuilding plus mood plus character). The recurring phrase “echo of forgotten songs” and a few expository clarifications edge toward mild redundancy, but not enough to drag momentum. Figurative language is frequent yet mostly controlled and coherent with the cosmic-digital aesthetic. There are no evident loops, scaffolding artifacts, or syntactic glitches that obscure sense or dull the closing image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The blend of social-network archive, corporate deletion, and digital afterlife is a familiar territory, but the specific combination of a “memory keeper,” recursive directory of erased lives, and the numeric code motif gives it a fresh inflection. The reconfiguration of the numbers into dates and a door code is an elegant, earned pattern rather than a gimmick. Still, neither premise nor turn are radically new, and a few beats (evil platform erases people, martyr-hero restores them) lean on genre conventions. The story feels thoughtfully executed more than groundbreaking, with solid but not astonishing ingenuity.</comment>
