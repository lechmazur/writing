<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lena’s grief, analytical mind, and almost predatory relationship to “potential” are specific and consistent, and her choice at the console is clearly rooted in those traits. Interiority is concrete (“burnt sugar and copper,” watching morgue footage of herself), and her refusal to aim for changing the past in favor of “hunting” it feels earned. There is some room to deepen contradiction around her father and the lost wedding partner, but what’s here reads psychologically coherent. The final shift from survivor to “the perturbation” is a credible endurance/renunciation stance with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The causal spine—hospital → stolen footage → father’s notes → observatory activation → glimpse of unmade moment → reframed goal—is clean and legible under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: she fails to alter events but succeeds in reweighting what “potential” and awakening mean to her. The threat of collapsing the field and the fate of the observatory are gestured at more than dramatized, so the external consequence of her act feels a bit soft. Still, the before/after in her stance is clear and on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The floating observatory, storm lattice, and glass dome are vivid and tightly bound to the premise; the vantage above the city is essential to seeing the “threads” of the past. The geode as recurring object doubles as micro-setting and charges the final image when she tucks it back into her pocket to “step into the dark, hunting.” Environmental elements (storm, power-down, emergency lights) are woven through action rather than dumped. The setting does constrain options—this work can only happen here, in this way—though the physical precariousness of the station could be exploited even more.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Lena’s drive to touch the locus of an unmade choice—is signaled early and tightens as the storm resolves into manipulable “threads.” The meaningful pressure point is her decision to key in her father’s frequency and ignore the scientist’s warning, choosing psychic revelation over safety. However, the potential collapse of the field and any wider consequences remain abstract, so the cost reads mostly emotional and conceptual rather than fully visceral. The escalation works, but the danger could be sharpened to feel less hypothetical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme around potential as hunted, not spent, and the pooling of unused futures is well-integrated through the geode, the father’s “pocket of unused time,” and the storm’s lattice of threads. The ending offers a clear, non-literal answer: awakening is not rectifying harm but reclaiming the felt weight of choice at its edge. A few lines tilt toward on-the-nose summary (“She wasn’t there to fix the past. She was there to remember...”), slightly reducing subtextive power. Overall, the thematic net is coherent and resonant without collapsing into a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is distinctive—scientific yet metaphorically sharp (“perturbation theory…was a knife”)—and remains stable under pressure. Lexicon and rhythm feel plausible for a scientifically literate protagonist and help fuse physics language with emotional stakes. Occasional thesis-like statements brush the edge of authorial intrusion, but they still sound like Lena’s mind working. POV discipline is tight, with no leakage into others’ interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is generally strong: images are vivid, sentences carry multiple jobs, and rhythm modulates well between exposition and peak moments. There is some density of figurative language, but most metaphors land cleanly and suit the tone; they rarely feel mixed or overwrought. Minor redundancy around “potential” and “hunting” appears, yet doesn’t materially slow momentum or blur closure. Syntax and mechanics are clean, with no obvious scaffolding or loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of drone-strike trauma, perturbation physics, and an observatory literally mapping pressure between futures and pasts feels fresh and thoughtfully executed. Treating “unused time” as a tangible resource in geologic/quantum terms, and having the protagonist seek not revision but the felt poise of unmade decisions, gives the piece a non-obvious angle. Several images (the veil as “intangibly tangible,” lightning as stitching ruins) are memorable. It stops short of truly radical risk-taking, but comfortably exceeds genre-template familiarity.</comment>
