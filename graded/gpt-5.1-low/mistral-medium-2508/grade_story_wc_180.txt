<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mender’s interiority is specific and embodied—the trembling fingers, the ache at the daughter’s “endearingly feisty” chin—and their motive to understand/repair with the daughter is clear and consistent. Contradictory impulses (duty to vows vs. loyalty to the daughter’s autonomy) are dramatized rather than told, especially around the priests’ contract and the apple. The final choice to take the ribbon, bite the apple, and leave the doll is an earned reconfiguration of their earlier stance, with a visible cost in pride and certainty. The daughter exists only via memory and magic-voice, but still feels particular rather than archetypal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story holds a clean single-scene spine (arrive/dig/find/plant/reprice) with one reflective band that’s well anchored (“They remembered the day the priests had come”). Causality is tight: finding the box leads to planting the seed, which immediately reconfigures knowledge through the sprout and orchard-voice. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the mender shifts from contractual obedience to a more organic, mutual vow, with on-page cost in surrendering their prior moral certainty. Stakes remain intimate and quiet, but the before/after is legible and motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The orchard-cathedral hybrid is vivid and specific—apples “smelled like forgiveness,” roots through marble, the broken rose window, ghosts-as-wind—and consistently filtered through the mender’s sensibility. Setting isn’t just backdrop: it supplies key constraints and resources (the spot “where the light bends,” the apple as forbidden/claimed, the tree that holds the ribbon and doll). Environmental details evolve with action (digging in loam, unearthing the box, the sprout emerging) and charge the final images. The world rules are lightly sketched but coherent for the story’s purposes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the mender will cling to old vows or re-open themselves to the daughter’s perspective—is clearly signaled but remains largely internal. Pressure escalates via the excavation and magical immediacy of the sprout and orchard-voice, which force the mender to confront their blind spot (“Why didn’t you read mine?”). The closing choices (tying on the ribbon, eating the apple, leaving the doll) credibly foreclose the path of rigid obedience. Still, tension operates more as steady ache than tightening vise, keeping pressure strong but not maximal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of deciduous vows, intergenerational wisdom, and the cost of teaching what you can’t fully live are woven organically through images (leaves, roots, apples, cracks) and the contract backstory. The ribbon, seed, and apple each return with reweighted meaning, culminating in the quiet but potent apple bite and doll-under-tree tableau. A couple of lines (“Some things fell away so others could take root”) veer toward explicit moralizing, slightly blunting the otherwise delicate subtext. Overall, the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of why the daughter left and what the mender must now become.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical but controlled texture that feels attuned to this particular character’s craft and preoccupations (quartz, ribs, stitches, cracks). Rhythm varies effectively between lush description and clipped realizations (“So the mender dug.” / “The mender laughed, sharp and sudden, because of course…”). Figurative language is patterned enough to feel intentional without becoming opaque, and there is no POV leakage or unmotivated distance shift. The occasional aphoristic sentence fits the fable-like register and doesn’t disrupt coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences pull multiple weights (setting, emotion, theme) with minimal redundancy, and the piece reads smoothly aloud. Metaphors are generally fresh and coherent (“stitches uneven as a heartbeat,” roots “stitching wound to wound”) and are not overstacked in a way that muddies clarity. Momentum is well managed for a lyric piece; even reflective passages keep advancing emotional stakes. There are no significant scaffolding loops or syntactic tics that dull the final beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of a post-contract magical orchard in a ruined cathedral with a “quartz-eye mender” is striking and feels singular rather than templated. The deciduous-vows metaphor is given concrete, surprising life through apples, roots, and the physical contract, and the immediate sprouting seed adds an inventive magical logic. The generational conflict is familiar but handled with enough specificity—the forgotten satchel, the box with spiral carvings, the doll holding the sprout—to feel fresh. Risks in worldbuilding and tone pay off cleanly at closure without obscuring meaning.</comment>
