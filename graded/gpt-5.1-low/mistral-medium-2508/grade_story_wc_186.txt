<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The custodian’s loneliness, stubborn hope, and retrocognitive burden are rendered with concrete, specific interiority ("just another kind of loneliness—seeing echoes of what had been, but never what could be"). Her core motivation—to rekindle the beacon in search of meaning—is clear and her actions consistently pursue that. Internal conflict exists but is relatively soft; she never seriously contemplates not trying, so contradiction under pressure is muted. The closing shift in her understanding of what the beacon is for feels earned by prior experience, if a bit tidily articulated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The structure is clean: climb → attempt to rekindle → flare → realization → aftermath, with backstory interleaved but always anchored to present stimuli. Causality is intact and legible under an accumulative/textural drive, and the closure delivers a conceptual repricing (it was never about bringing the past back) with a felt emotional cost. Stakes are somewhat abstract—there’s little concrete consequence if the attempt fails beyond her continued loneliness—which keeps the narrative from fully tightening. Still, the final alignment of stars, beacon, and rain coheres as a satisfying before/after shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The glass beacon-tower, humming pavilion, carved star paths, and salt-worn glass steps are vivid, selective, and strongly filtered through her functional familiarity. Setting is not postcard decoration: the star paths and pedestal directly mediate her attempt, and the beacon/pavilion’s hum and later “song” charge the climax and final image. The post-collapse landscape and first scent of rain subtly mirror the thematic reweighting without feeling forced. Environment and recurring objects clearly constrain choice and emotionally load the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether she can rekindle the beacon and thereby confirm that coincidences have pattern/meaning—is established early and carried through. There is a clear escalation from tracing the paths to the tower igniting, but external resistance or meaningful risk is minimal; success comes without much on-page opposition or real uncertainty. Internal stakes deepen (her understanding of what she’s really seeking), yet they’re resolved quickly once the flare occurs. As a result, tension is present but relatively gentle rather than gripping.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of memory, lost futures, pattern versus randomness, and the search for meaning in collapse arise organically from the prism, retrocognition, and coincidences. The realization that “it had never been about bringing the past back” is on-the-nose but still earned by the specific history with the beacon and her mother. The final gestures—mended prism, rain after years, willingness to climb again—offer a resonant, non-literal answer about thinned but persistent meaning and hope. There’s complexity in accepting enduring loneliness alongside that hope rather than a neat moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinctly colored by her mix of technical familiarity (star paths, scholars) and weary awe. Diction and rhythm are controlled and modulate well between reflective passages and the flare sequence. There’s no POV leakage or unmotivated omniscience; everything stays tightly bound to her perceptions and inferences. A few phrases brush familiar lyrical territory, but overall the perceptual signature feels specific rather than generic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, generally high-density, and most images do more than one job (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme together). Figurative language is frequent but not muddled; metaphors like “a shard of hush” and “thistle-blown moment” are coherent and tonally apt. There is little obvious scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and the prose carries momentum despite its lyricism. At times it edges toward purple, but clarity and the closure image remain crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The fusion of retrocognition, a humming glass beacon-tower, and a literal “shard of hush” is a fresh-feeling synthesis within post-apocalyptic SF. The shift from wanting to resurrect the past to recognizing the value of patterned coincidence and potential future echoes avoids standard “we must rebuild” clichés. While the broad frame (lone custodian at the last beacon in a ruined world) is familiar, the particular textures and conceptual reframing give it distinctiveness. It’s imaginative and coherent, if not radically groundbreaking.</comment>
