<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Liora is sharply sketched as a disgraced but still driven astronomer whose competence and stubbornness feel grounded in specific details (knowing every dial notch, sneaking into the old station). Her motivation—to push back against a manipulative cosmic force and the institution that sidelined her—is clear and consistent. Internal contradiction (caution vs. hope) is present but handled in shorthand rather than fully dramatized in micro-choices. The final stance—she keeps the line open, "just fixing the radio"—is earned, though the emotional cost remains somewhat understated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: a changed signal, Liora’s decision to interfere, the campus’s palpable reaction, and the signal’s shift from predatory to curious. Orientation is solid from the outset, and the story sustains a single coherent scene with no temporal confusion. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the relationship between humans and the signal, and between Liora and her institution, has shifted from helplessness to wary dialogue. The cost—risk of professional and perhaps existential fallout—is implied rather than sharply articulated, which keeps this below the very top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The basement radio station, old physics hall, and campus above are vividly evoked and feel lived-in, with details like the "building’s bones" shivering and charts fluttering under the ventilation. The environment materially enables the plot (old unlocked station, functional equipment) and allows her to affect the whole campus. Sensory detail leans visual and auditory in a way that suits the subject matter without becoming touristic. Setting does not fully corner her choices, but it meaningfully frames and charges them.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—refusing to be a pawn of both cosmic forces and campus politics—is clear and escalates as Liora pushes harder against the signal and it pushes back. Her interference produces visible consequences (arguments falter, protests stall, the signal "laughs"), and there is a credible turn when the signal’s tone becomes curious instead of predatory. However, the on-page price she pays for this defiance is relatively soft; her professional and ethical risks are told more than felt in the climax. The tension is sustained but never quite bites as hard as the premise allows.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of agency versus manipulation, institutional fracture reflecting cosmic scrutiny, and conflict transforming from aggression to conversation are woven cleanly through events rather than lectured. The idea that their divisions become "scars—proof they’d survived something" offers a neat but resonant reframing of the campus turmoil. One on-the-nose line (“This wasn’t about winning. It was about proving they weren’t pawns.”) slightly flattens what is otherwise well-embedded subtext. Overall the ending leaves a clear, reflective aftertaste without collapsing into a tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is controlled and distinctive, blending scientific specificity with lyric imagery ("static hissed... like a nest of angry stars") in a way that matches Liora’s mind. POV remains tight to her perceptions and knowledge; even the entity’s "laughter" is rendered as an embodied inference (skull pressure, aching teeth). Rhythm varies effectively between dense description and brisk causal beats, and there is no head-hopping or unmotivated register drift. Dialogue, though brief, feels natural and in character for both Liora and the grad student.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is generally lean and purposeful, with most sentences carrying dual loads of atmosphere and information. Metaphors are frequent but coherent and on-theme, enhancing rather than obscuring clarity. There are no noticeable scaffolding loops or template cadences, and the final image of her reaching for the dial again lands cleanly. A minor density of figurative language in places edges toward lushness but never quite tips into purple or confusion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The fusion of campus political fracture with a seemingly sentient cosmic signal that manipulates social tensions feels fresh and conceptually tight. Using subsonic interference from a forgotten university radio station as the method of "talking back" is an inventive, character-rooted twist on first-contact tropes. The final shift from threat to wary curiosity is non-obvious yet earned by the prior beats. While the premise rests on familiar SETI/contact frameworks, the specific social and institutional inflection gives it individuality.</comment>
