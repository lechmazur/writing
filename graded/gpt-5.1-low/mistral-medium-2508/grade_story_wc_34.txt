<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The balladeer is sharply etched: his vocation, curse, and inherited language of pressing/encoding all align into a coherent psychology. His central conflict—whether to let the ghost out into himself or deny it—is well motivated by his lifelong role as translator of silence. The memory of his grandmother meaningfully complicates the final choice. A minor limitation is that his fear/desire to be inhabited by the ghost is more implied than fully dramatized in moment-to-moment interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The structure is cleanly causal within a lyric frame: he encodes, the ghost answers, its need escalates, and his final encoding act resolves the situation. Orientation (who/where/what) is clear very early despite the surreal setting. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Decisive Change: he forecloses becoming the host and disperses the ghost at a discernible cost. A small weakness is that the rules of the code/ghost interface remain abstract, so the exact risk of failure is more atmospheric than concretely mapped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above clouds, slick cobblestones, and dying lanterns create a vivid, coherent environment that matches the story’s liminal stakes. The courtyard and its lanterns are not mere backdrop; they house the ghost, register its presence, and react to its dispersal, while the bolt plate is a charged object that shapes the final act. Sensory specificity (ozone, wet silk air, parchment) is purposeful rather than touristic. The world’s “forgotten server room” metaphor hints at broader rules without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The core stake—whether he becomes the vessel for a vast, hungry code-ghost—is clear and escalates from eerie contact to invasive pressure. The tightening is effective when the graffiti physically rips and the ghost’s desire to enter him becomes visceral, forcing a choice. His decision to encode a rest and slam the plate down is an active, consequential resolution with visible cost in his raw, unused voice and empty hands. Tension is strong but stays mostly internal and atmospheric; a touch more concrete jeopardy could sharpen the sense of irreversibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of translating silence, inherited tools for articulating unspoken need, and the ethics of containment vs. expression are woven through flowers, graffiti, and code in a rich, coherent way. The ending’s shift to the child in the valley and “the work was never really done. But for now, the silence was enough” offers resonant, non-didactic repricing of what “enough” means. Subtext about listening to marginalized hungers and the danger of becoming their vessel is present without sermonizing. A hair more ambiguity about whether dispersing the ghost is mercy or loss could deepen the aftertaste further.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is lyrical but controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature that marries folk-magic and digital metaphor (“ghost in code,” “forgotten server room”). Rhythm modulates well, slowing for contemplative beats and tightening at the climax without losing clarity. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the sparse bit of quoted speech from the ghost feels distinct but integrated. At times, the diction edges toward uniformly elevated, which slightly flattens dynamic range under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, images are concrete, and most metaphors are coherent and multi-functional. Phrases like “air hung thick as wet silk between lightning and thunder” and “a chorus of screams wrapped in a lullaby” are evocative and on-theme. There is some risk of figurative overload—multiple metaphors stacked in quick succession in early paragraphs—that edges toward purple without quite tipping into opacity. Trimming a few adornments in high-pressure beats would increase impact and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fusion of folk balladry, analog tools (flower press bolt plate), and quasi-digital hauntology (“ghost in code,” server-room sky) feels fresh and specific. Using graffiti as a living score and encoding medium is an inventive tactic that grows organically from his character and world. The final handoff to a valley child with chalk elegantly reframes the premise as an ongoing, intergenerational work of articulating need. While individual components nod to known tropes (hauntings, liminal courtyards), their synthesis and emotional stance are distinctly memorable.</comment>
