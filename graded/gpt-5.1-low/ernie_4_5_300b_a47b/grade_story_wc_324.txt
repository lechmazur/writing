<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lila’s role, methods, and emotional tenor are clear and consistent, and her gentleness plus workmanlike competence feel particular rather than generic. However, she experiences almost no real internal conflict or doubt—her “persistently curious” trait never forces a painful trade-off—and her emotional cost is limited to mild throat-tightening. The widow is sketched efficiently but remains archetypal. The final reassurance lands, but without a sense that Lila had to struggle against herself or her limits to earn it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean and legible: photo → vibration via old hearing aid → deeper into atrium → second hearing aid → message → delivery to widow, with no orientation issues. The story satisfies closure through a decisive change in knowledge and relief for both widow and ghost, plus a modest reconfiguration in Lila’s sense of her work. That said, the path feels relatively frictionless—there is never a moment where failure seems genuinely possible—so the structure reads polished but low-pressure. Still, for this length, the single continuous scene with a clear arc is strong and publishable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium is vivid and textured—“bruised violet” twilight, moss, fountain, piano, cobwebbed gallery all create a strong, coherent mood integrated with Lila’s movements. Details are filtered through her work and sensibility rather than feeling like a tourist list. While the setting mostly supports atmosphere rather than constraining concrete choices, the atrium as a place “where the dead called” and the fountain as the locus of the photo do subtly shape what can happen and where. The recurrence of mist and interior architecture into the final beats helps charge the ending image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—conveying a dead man’s unsaid reassurance to his partner—is clear and emotionally intelligible. However, escalation is minimal: once Lila hears the faint pulse, each subsequent step succeeds on first attempt with no meaningful setback, time pressure, or ethical dilemma. Her agency is present but never really tested, so the cost of failure remains abstract and distant. The quiet tone is fine, but even within that mode the story could use one concrete obstacle or trade-off to deepen tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Themes of listening, grief, and small-scale “incidental heroism” emerge coherently from the premise and Lila’s actions, and the final echo of stories that “weren’t meant to end” has genuine resonance. Yet the piece leans into overt statement—“Sometimes love is too big for words. But it’s never too late to hear it.” and “Incidental heroism… wasn’t about grand gestures.”—that reads as moralizing rather than fully earned subtext. The emotional effect is touching but veers toward sentimentality, smoothing away potential complexity in grief, regret, or doubt. Strong thematic bones, but the articulation could trust image and implication more.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is steady, with a clear, mildly lyrical texture that feels aligned to Lila’s sensibility and the genre. Diction and rhythm are generally well-controlled; sensory images like “heartbeat trapped in amber” or “reeling hush of the atrium” are apt for the tone. Dialogue is sparse but natural and functional, and there is no POV leakage or explanatory overreach. A few lines edge into generalized phrasing (“weight of the moment,” “unspoken gratitude”) but they don’t meaningfully disrupt the voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose is clean, grammatical, and varied, with many sentences doing double-duty for atmosphere and character. There is occasional purple or cliché-adjacent wording (“forgotten promises,” “the atrium seemed to exhale,” “weight of the moment settling in her chest”), but not in a way that obscures meaning or muddies key beats. Momentum is steady; there are no obvious paraphrase loops or structural scaffolds, and action order remains clear. Tightening a few sentimental or stock formulations would likely elevate the piece into a more distinct stylistic register.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise—a “contact tracer for hearts” using old hearing aids to catch lingering emotional pulses in a haunted atrium—is fresh and appealing, and the method of listening through objects is a nice twist on standard ghost communication. The notion of incidental, small-scale heroism in grief work feels authentic rather than gimmicky. However, the core emotional beat (a ghost finally saying “Assure her I loved her”) is familiar, and the story doesn’t quite push into a stranger or more morally knotted space that would feel truly singular. Overall, it’s a strong, original inflection on recognizable genre terrain.</comment>
