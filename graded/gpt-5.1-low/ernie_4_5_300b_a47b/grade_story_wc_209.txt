<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara’s obsession, artistic sensibility, and link to her grandmother are vivid and consistent, and her micro-choices (sneaking into the cathedral, refocusing her murals on shadow) track well with that drive. Internal contradiction—art as both vocation and distraction from the real obsession—is present but rarely put under acute pressure. Sister Agatha functions effectively as a gentle foil but never really stresses Mara’s priorities. The closing sense of “I’ve only just begun to reckon” feels earned, though the personal cost of that stance is only lightly sketched.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: commission → fixation on window/postcards → Sister Agatha’s exposition → nocturnal investigation → inscription discovery → artistic shift → systematic cataloging. Structure is mostly linear with some efficient summary leaps that fit an accumulative/lyric design and keep orientation clear. Closure is a conceptual repricing: Mara’s understanding of nocturnal blooming and of the window’s “map to the hush” deepens, reweighting her grandmother’s note and her own work, though with soft on-page cost. The global drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds throughout without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The abbey, amber pavilion, cathedral, and etched window are concretely rendered with strong sensory specificity (“amber pavilion,” changing light on etchings, violet glow) that supports tone and theme. Setting is consistently filtered through Mara’s artistic and botanical biases, which sharpens atmosphere. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain her options beyond providing access to the window, it does charge the central images and the final return to autumn leaves. Spatial and temporal anchors are clear and stable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake is Mara’s need to decode the window’s language to answer her grandmother’s question, with a secondary tension between her restoration commission and private obsession. Pressure rises modestly through the discovery of the humming glass and the violet inscription, leading to her reorienting her art around shadow and hush. However, conflict remains largely internal and contemplative, with minimal external resistance or tangible jeopardy; no significant option is visibly foreclosed. The escalation thus feels more like steady deepening than a sharp tightening with clear price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Thematically, the piece weaves light/dark, revelation/secrecy, and communion vs defiance into a coherent argument via nocturnal flowers, stained glass, and Mara’s murals. The “map to the hush” and the window’s shifting appearance across the day embody the idea that some truths require darkness and liminality. The explicit articulation—“Flowers bloom at night not in defiance, but in communion”—edges toward thesis statement but arises credibly from accumulated experience. The final image of an unbroken final layer promises further reckoning and prevents the theme from closing into a pat moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The third-person-limited voice is lyrically inclined but controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Mara’s artistic and botanical sensibilities. Psychic distance is stable, and the narration largely avoids over-explaining what the images already convey. Dialogue is sparse yet natural and purposeful, especially Sister Agatha’s “map to the hush” line that reframes Mara’s quest. The voice maintains coherence across time shifts, with only minor omniscient-leaning summary at the critic/tourist level that doesn’t disrupt focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, densely informative, and often do double duty in advancing both scene and theme. Figurative language (“autumn leaves clung… like fiery confetti,” “umbral tenderness”) is rich but generally precise and not so stacked as to become purple or muddled. There are no notable scaffolding loops or template cadences, and rhythm modulates well between scene and summary. A few abstractions (“restless energy that coiled in her chest”) lean familiar, but they don’t materially dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of nocturnal botany, sacred art restoration, and a quasi-mystical stained-glass “map to the hush” feels fresh and particular. Elias Thorn’s buried sketches, the unreadable window across seasons, and Mara’s bioluminescent murals create a memorable conceptual ecology rather than a generic gothic mystery. The core turn—from seeing night-blooming as defiance to understanding it as communion with darkness—is thematically strong and non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. The main limitation is that the plot skeleton (artist decodes symbolic window, integrates insight into art) is recognizable, even if the inflection here is distinctive.</comment>
