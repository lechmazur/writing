<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation and competence are clear and consistent, and her attachment to Elara and the patch gives her a distinct emotional core. However, her inner life remains relatively straightforward—more driven than conflicted—so we don’t see much contradictory impulse under pressure. Hale functions as a flat, purely obstructive antagonist, which lowers the sense of complex human stakes. The final choice to upload the coordinates and go rogue is motivated but could carry more embodied fear or doubt to deepen character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: curiosity about the patch → discovery of recurring numbers → Project Lazarus → video → coordinates → confrontation and flight. The single-scene structure with one night’s investigation escalating to a security breach works coherently, and the ending lands as a Charged Poise: she irreversibly commits to a new path with visible risk. Some beats (e.g., the instantaneous jump from coordinates to “derelict research station”) feel a bit convenience-driven rather than hard-won. Still, closure is solid, with a legible before/after and conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The social network archive is effectively sketched—servers humming, holographic interfaces, “ghostly impressions in the system’s memory”—and the recurring patch acts as a micro-setting object. The space feels coherent and supports the investigative mood, and the environment briefly constrains action once alarms and drones engage. However, the archive could more sharply shape tactics (e.g., specific constraints of corporate systems or physical layout under threat) rather than serving mostly as atmospheric backdrop. The derelict research station is important conceptually but remains underdescribed on the page.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the erased truth versus being silenced—appears early and remains focused. Pressure escalates credibly from quiet research to uncovering Project Lazarus, to the explosive implication of the gateway deleting people, to immediate physical danger when Hale and the drones arrive. Lira’s choice to upload the coordinates into her neural implant while under threat is a meaningful narrowing of options, effectively foreclosing safety. The cost is implied rather than dramatized—her likely fugitive status and danger are clear, but we don’t yet see a concrete sacrifice beyond risk-taking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of memory, erasure, and corporate control emerge organically from the archive setting, Elara’s missing status, and Project Lazarus’s goal of deleting not just files but people. Recurring images—“echoes,” “ghostly impressions,” the frayed mission patch—support a sense of fragile remembrance. Some dialogue and narration lean close to thesis statements (“Some truths aren’t meant to be found”; “She was done letting the company erase the echoes of the lost”), which flattens subtlety. Still, the final image of her departure with the coordinates in her neural implant offers a resonant stance against enforced forgetting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV around Lira is stable and believable, with consistent access to her perceptions and thoughts. Prose texture is competent with occasional nice turns (“ghostly impressions in the system’s memory, like footprints in snow”), and the narrative line is easy to follow. Hale’s dialogue feels somewhat stock and declarative, lacking subtext or idiosyncrasy, which slightly undercuts voice distinction. Overall, the voice is clear and serviceable but not yet strongly singular.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sentences are generally clean, grammatical, and well-paced, with no major loops or scaffolding artifacts; momentum through the investigative sequence is maintained. There is some reliance on familiar genre phrasing and sensory shorthand (“sea of data streams,” “her heart raced”), and modifiers can stack toward the purple at times. Still, information density is reasonable, and key beats (decoding, the video reveal, the final confrontation) are depicted clearly. Line-level craft is solid but not yet sharpened to an elite, highly distinctive edge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The combination of corporate archive, recurring numerical code, and a wormhole “gateway” that erases people is engaging but draws on well-worn SF conspiracy and lost-astronaut tropes. The social network archive and “corporate memory keeper” role add a fresher angle, as does the idea of digital traces resisting deletion. However, many turns (the lying executive, the hidden coordinates, the security drones at discovery) follow familiar genre grooves without a non-obvious twist in moral calculus or world logic. The piece feels promising and polished rather than strikingly original.</comment>
