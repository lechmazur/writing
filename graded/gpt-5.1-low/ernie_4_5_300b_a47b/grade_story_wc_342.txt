<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lira’s perception (face-blind, memorizing “souls through textures and hues”) is vivid and particular, and her curiosity credibly drives the discovery of the panel and the choice to paint the sky. Her motives around preservation vs. obedience to the commission feel organic. The main weakness is an underplayed internal conflict over taking the safe and effectively stealing the guild’s secret; she moves through that decision almost too smoothly for this to hit elite-level depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: commission → noticing the empty shelf → coin indentations → secret safe → journal’s revelation → choice to encode the stars in her painting → demolition forcing her exit. The demolition tests (rumble, first blow) provide a concrete ticking clock that narrows options and gives the closure real cost: the library is lost, the legacy survives only via the hidden safe and her work. Closure reads as a small but clear decisive change with cost, though the final stretch leans slightly more on summary than dramatized beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The oak trunk library is richly realized—damp bark, hollowed interior, shelves, hidden panel—and the environment directly shapes action through the panel’s placement, the grain’s star patterns, and the physical threat of demolition. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (wet soil, old parchment, dust raining at impact) and the later contrast with the “starless city sky” reweights the setting at the end. The only thing keeping this just shy of the very top band is that the demolition site’s physical logistics and danger remain slightly abstract rather than fully embodied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the guild’s legacy under a demolition deadline—is clear and escalates through the discovery of deeper secrets and the literal countdown to impact. The journal’s revelation reframes her task from mere documentation of decay to active preservation, a strong mid-story tightening, and the wrecking ball’s first blow is a well-timed external spike. However, her internal and ethical conflict (duty to commission vs. clandestine safeguarding, risk vs. obedience to the crew) could be sharpened to show a more painful trade-off at the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Themes of preservation, limits, and mirroring the sky inside walls are coherently woven through the guild’s star-map calendar, the secret journal, and Lira’s final painting and theft of the safe. The final realization that “they couldn’t save their home, but they could ensure their knowledge outlived it” makes for a resonant conceptual repricing of what preservation means. Some thematic lines are a bit explicit and expository, slightly flattening what could be left to image and implication, which holds this just below the top tier.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, with a strong perceptual signature centered on texture, pattern, and hue that feels anchored in Lira’s way of seeing. Diction and rhythm are elevated but controlled, supporting the slightly mythic, hushed atmosphere without slipping into academic abstraction. There’s minor risk of lyrical sameness in some phrasing, but no real POV leakage or stance confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prose is generally tight and vivid, with sentences often doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“fractually precise patterns in the grain, spirals that mirrored the constellations she’d never seen”). Rhythm varies, and description rarely stalls momentum. A few repeated constructions and slightly purple touches (“fractually precise” echoed, “heightened stillness” named twice) keep it from feeling utterly knife-sharp, but they don’t materially obscure clarity or dull the closing image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a face-blind portrait artist, a living tree-library, and a secret astronomical calendar designed to outlive demolition feels fresh and specific. The notion of “mirroring the sky inside walls” via wood grain and paint gives the piece a distinct conceptual spine. While not radically experimental, the story commits to its unusual premise and follows through to a non-obvious, thematically coherent closure.</comment>
