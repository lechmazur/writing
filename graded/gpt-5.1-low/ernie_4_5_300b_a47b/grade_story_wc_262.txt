<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motives (to locate “unused love” and decode her grandmother’s legacy) are clear, and her emotional responses to the film and letters feel grounded and embodied (“throat tightened,” trembling, the ache in her chest). The psychometry visions give her interiority a concrete vehicle instead of pure summary. However, we get limited contradictory impulse or real micro-dilemma—she never seriously considers walking away, and the final decision to devote herself to the theater’s secrets comes without visible cost or resistance. Elise and Thomas live mostly as backstory rather than on-page relational pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The structure is cleanly causal: Mara arrives with a goal, uses psychometry, receives one vision, then a deepened second vision with names and history, and exits with a reconfigured mission. Backstory is anchored to immediate sensory triggers (film strip, booth) and doesn’t fracture orientation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise—the idea of “unused love” is literalized and she chooses an ongoing role as its steward—but the price of that choice is only lightly implied, not sharply dramatized. The drive lens (primarily causal with a lyric overlay) holds consistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The projection booth is vivid and specific—dust, decayed film stock, rattling window, rain—and feels lived-in rather than touristic. The Alhambra itself is not just backdrop but the functional container of the letters and history; the booth is explicitly described as a place that “incubate[s] that pain.” Environmental details (rain, hum, lilacs, creaking lobby) mirror and charge the emotional movement and the final descent from the booth. The setting meaningfully shapes the premise and final image, not just the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering where unused love is stored and what happened to Elise/Thomas—is clear, and the psychometric visions represent an escalation in knowledge and emotional pressure. However, conflict remains mostly internal and contemplative; there is no strong opposing force or hard trade-off that narrows options. The second, more focused reading of the film is a solid tightening beat but still comes without real risk or cost beyond discomfort. As a result, the ending stance choice feels meaningful but not hard-won.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of stored grief, residual love, and spaces holding emotional residue run coherently through the film, letters, theater, and crystal. The idea of a “theater of light where love went to die” is especially strong, and the final realization that unused love “was just waiting for someone to notice it” nicely reframes the earlier metaphor. That line, however, edges toward explicit thesis statement and flirts with sentimentality instead of leaving more work to subtext. Overall, the thematic web is solid and resonant, if a bit literal at the close.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is stable, with a gentle lyricism suited to Mara’s sensibility and the occult premise. Diction and rhythm (“hushed thunder that matched the ache in her chest,” “world as a lattice of memories”) give the prose a distinct texture without overreaching. The mechanism of psychometry neatly justifies the otherwise omniscient access to Elise and Thomas’s interior states. There’s no head-hopping or register clash, and psychic distance is handled with quiet confidence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied in length, and generally economical, with specific nouns and verbs doing the work. Figurative language is present but not so dense that it muddies sense, and most images (lattice of memories, incubation, theater of light) cohere. There are a few slightly abstract or on-the-nose phrases (“unused love,” “unresolved grief”) that risk flattening nuance, but they don’t significantly blunt momentum or clarity. No obvious loops, scaffolding, or syntactic monotony impede the read.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The combination of a vintage movie palace, psychic object-reading, and the notion of “unused love” stored in film canisters is an appealing and fairly fresh synthesis. The WWII romance and goodbye letters are familiar territory, but embedding them in a haunted-object/psychometry frame gives them a new contour. The crystal and Alhambra-as-reservoir motifs feel unified rather than gimmicky. It stops short of radical innovation, yet the overall configuration and emotional tenor are distinctive enough to linger.</comment>
