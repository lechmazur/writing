<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Aris’s motivation is clear, specific, and sustained—his professional obsession and moral stance drive every choice, especially the decision to risk his job to run the counter-signal. Interiority and embodied emotion (“trembling finger,” “tears traced clean paths”) are strong if somewhat idealized. Internal conflict is underdeveloped; he rarely feels genuinely torn between job security and cosmic duty, which slightly flattens the climax. Still, the final charged poise—accepting Croft’s wrath while holding the line—feels earned by the preceding setup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under a primarily causal lens, the structure is clean: cosmic manipulation → Aris’s long-prepared plan → memo raising the cost → midnight alignment and broadcast → partial relief → Croft’s approach as a closing pressure. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he has altered the situation (trickster signal suppressed, campus de-escalated) and now faces institutional consequences. The cause-and-effect of the subsonic interference on the quad is clear, if a bit convenient and unresisted by the antagonistic forces. A slightly more contested or complicated payoff would push this toward the top tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The basement radio station, oscilloscope glow, dust motes, and the view onto the protesting quad create a vivid, atmospheric micro-setting that feels lived-in and specific. The equipment and reinforced window aren’t just décor—they enable his interference and let him witness the change outside. Astronomical charts function as both tool and symbolic map, returning in the final image to charge the closing moment. Setting doesn’t radically constrain options beyond providing the transmitter, but it strongly supports tone and stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—community cohesion vs. manipulative cosmic discord, with Aris’s career as secondary—is clear early and tightens toward the timed pulsar alignment and Croft’s ultimatum. Escalation is mostly linear but effective: memo raises cost, midnight window narrows options, and the live broadcast cannot be undone. The main weakness is the lack of on-page active resistance from the tricksters or Croft during the act itself, which softens the sense of struggle at the peak. Still, Aris’s choice to proceed in the face of likely firing gives the ending real, if modestly scaled, cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story articulates a coherent theme of countering manipulation and power plays not with brute force but with carefully tuned empathy and resonance. This emerges through particulars—the choice of a “frequency of empathy,” the contrast between Croft’s bureaucratic silencing and Aris’s quiet defiance, and the tentative human reconnection on the quad. Some lines edge toward explicit thesis (“This was ethereal grit,” “fight darkness with a whisper”), but they are supported enough by scene work to avoid pure sermonizing. The final sense that victories are fragile yet worth the cost offers a resonant, non-tidy answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct blend of technical diction and lyrical cosmic imagery that clearly belongs to someone who lives in both astronomy and radio. Rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled, with no POV leakage or confusing distance shifts. The elevated register (“entities of pure manipulative intent,” “resonant interference”) remains plausible for this specific character’s mind. There’s no dialogue to test, but the narrative voice carries pressure and interiority effectively through the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, information-dense, and often do double duty (world-building plus emotion, concept plus action). There is some tendency toward abstraction and coined phrases (“celestial puppeteers,” “cosmic game continued”) that pile up and occasionally feel a touch purple, but they rarely impede clarity. Repetition of certain conceptual terms (hope, fragile, cosmic/ethereal language) nudges at over-patterning without becoming outright loop. Rhythm and concision are good enough that momentum never stalls.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The fusion of campus politics, community fracture, and literal cosmic tricksters working through subsonic background noise is a fresh, memorable premise. Using a small university radio station and a quasar-derived “frequency of empathy” as the counter-weapon feels inventive and internally coherent. The emotional arc—quiet, stubborn resistance rather than grand heroics—fits the “ethereal grit” concept and avoids genre-template beats. A slightly more surprising moral or tactical complication at the climax could elevate it further, but this already reads as distinct and publication-ready with minor refinement.</comment>
