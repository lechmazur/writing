<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira is sharply drawn through her pattern of noticing, her guilt, and her commitment to planting; her micro-choices (tasting the bread, deciding to keep planting) feel grounded in those traits. The old woman is more archetypal and largely a mouthpiece, but still clear and coherent. The internal conflict between complicity/guilt and a more sacred motivation is compact yet convincing for the length. The closing stance—continuing to plant with a sobered understanding that it won’t be “enough”—reads like an earned, costly endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Structure is clean: discovery of the tea house → impossible bread → interlocutor’s revelation → reconfigured understanding → renewed, specified plan. Causality is intact and easy to follow, and the accumulative lens of noticing/erasure → partial restoration is consistent. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration rather than a big decisive act, but the before/after in Mira’s understanding and intention is legible. The one-scene container fits the scope, though the stakes remain mostly conceptual rather than being tested in a concrete on-page dilemma.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The palace grounds, brambles, and tea house are vivid, selective, and thematically aligned with creeping normality and reclamation; details like “moss crept higher” and “stonework looked somehow younger” do real work. The environment is not just backdrop: Mira’s gardening choices, the hidden tea house, and the autumn wind/leaves all charge the final image and reinforce the memory/erasure axis. Sensory detail is strong without feeling touristic or over-described. World rules about erasure/restoration come through in setting interactions (walls, vines, bread) rather than exposition dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—resisting erasure versus drifting into complicity/forgetting—is clear but stays subtle and mostly interior. Discovery of the bread and the revelation of Demyan’s role deepen pressure conceptually, recontextualizing Mira’s own past “explanations” for disappearances, but she is never forced into a visibly difficult trade-off on the page. Her choice to continue planting with a revised understanding is meaningful yet not sharply contested by a concrete alternative or risk in the moment. Tension is present but quiet, more contemplative than acute.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of memory vs oblivion, complicity vs resistance, and the sacred in the ordinary are woven consistently through images (seeds, bread, leaves, roots) and Mira’s realizations. The idea that “seeds remember” and gardens as archaeology is a strong emergent metaphor. However, a couple of thesis-like lines (“You plant to find the sacred in the ordinary”; “The sacred in the ordinary. The ordinary against oblivion.”) edge toward overt statement rather than letting the images carry the full weight. The ending still leaves a resonant, non-tidy sense of partial, costly resistance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is controlled and distinctive, with phrases like “heuristically gentle hands” and a perceptual focus that clearly belongs to Mira. Dialogue feels natural and purposeful, delivering world logic and theme without collapsing entirely into exposition. Psychic distance is consistent and modulates well, allowing both atmospheric description and tight interior shifts without confusion. The lyrical texture supports the contemplative mode without sliding into vagueness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is elegant, precise, and rhythmically varied, with high information density—most sentences advance atmosphere, world, and character simultaneously. Figurative language is present but not overstacked; images like “falling into earth that remembered everything” are clear and earned. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or grammatical slips, and transitions between description, thought, and dialogue are smooth. Line-level control strongly supports the story’s quiet, accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fusion of guerrilla gardening, creeping ontological erasure, and partial restoration via “seeds remember” is a fresh and well-integrated premise. The tea house, impossible bread, and moral frame of tenuous absolution give the piece a distinctive angle on themes of gentrification, forgetting, or magical realism-style disappearance. While some thematic statements are familiar, the specific mechanism (gardens as archaeological uncLoaking rather than simple nostalgia) feels original. The story commits to its quiet, conceptual stakes rather than reaching for larger but emptier spectacle.</comment>
