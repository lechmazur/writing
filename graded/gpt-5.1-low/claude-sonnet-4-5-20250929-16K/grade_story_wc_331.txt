<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Meridian’s interiority is specific and rooted in concrete history (the grandmother, the logbooks, the tactile obsession with books), and her motivations are clear and consistent across the piece. Her “sanely eccentric” traits are dramatized through behavior rather than labels, and the intellectual drive feels lived-in. The internal change—from believing geometry is a tool to realizing it is the place itself—is earned by the preceding work. What’s slightly missing at this tier is a sharper sense of internal contradiction or visible cost to this realization beyond a gentle reorientation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The accumulative structure is clean: we move from present work → backstory and method → immediate discovery → conceptual revaluation with a clear before/after. Causality is tight at the scale the story chooses (her long project leads to the model; the model reveals voids; the voids force the new understanding). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing that makes her three-year project and her grandmother’s legacy feel different in hindsight. Stakes are modest and mostly intellectual/emotional, which limits the sense of cost but not coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The observatory-turned-scientific-poetry library is vividly specific and filtered through Meridian’s obsessions, with details like Maxwell villanelles and quantum sestinas doing heavy atmospheric lifting. The setting’s curvature and stacks directly echo and embody the conceptual stakes, and the final image of the library “breathing” with curving shelves feels charged. The scarf functions as a micro-setting object that anchors both her body and the model. The only thing keeping this from the 9-band is that the environment guides meaning more than it constrains concrete choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether her hyperbolic mapping can truly locate “where stories live”—is established early and deepened by the discovery of the voids. There is one clear escalation when she notices the interference patterns and recognizes they represent something her equations can’t capture. However, there’s little sense of genuine risk or trade-off; if her insight failed, nothing on the page would materially worsen for her beyond disappointment. The conflict remains largely conceptual and serene, which is elegant but keeps pressure moderate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of presence vs. data, analog memory, and the in-between space of reader and text are woven concretely through scarf, logbooks, and library topology. The final realization reweights earlier images—especially the grandmother’s hand-written work and the notion of curvature—as an answer that was embedding her life all along. However, lines like “Stories live in the curvature. Not as metaphor, but as literal truth” verge on thesis statement and slightly blunt the subtext. A touch more reliance on image and a shade less direct articulation would deepen the lingering resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is confident, with controlled lyricism and a distinct intellectual texture that suits Meridian’s mind. Diction, rhythm, and metaphor feel consistent with a character steeped in both math and poetry, and the narrative distance is stable. The prose modulates well between descriptive density and more abstract reflection without losing clarity. It stops short of formally daring experiments, but within a conventional frame, control is high.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and images that are both original and legible (“saddle-shaped surfaces,” “geodesics” of borrowing, the scarf settling into predicted curves). Figurative language is frequent but rarely feels purple or incoherent, and there are no noticeable loops or scaffolding phrases. The rhythm supports the contemplative mode and doesn’t drag despite the abstract content. A few explanatory phrases could be tightened, but they don’t significantly harm momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of hyperbolic geometry, library science, poetic form, and analog memory is genuinely fresh, and the “scientific poetry library” plus emotional topologies feel like a distinctive artistic stance. The idea that stories literally inhabit curvature between reader and text, mapped via a three-year geometric project, pushes beyond familiar “books are magic” tropes. The risk is primarily conceptual rather than structural, but it pays off in a specific, non-obvious final repricing. It falls just short of the highest band only because the emotional and narrative risk remains relatively safe and contained.</comment>
