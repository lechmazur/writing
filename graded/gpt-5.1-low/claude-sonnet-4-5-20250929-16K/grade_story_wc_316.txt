<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Kenji’s numbness, desire to feel, and ambivalence about his clone are clear and consistent, and Yoon’s tough, incisive guidance functions as a strong relational crucible. His final decision in court is credibly motivated by the dojo scene and his re-framing of the clone as “complement,” with visible emotional cost. There’s some diagnostic phrasing (“ego death,” “built new walls”) and lightly summarized emotion that slightly flattens texture in peak beats, but not enough to undercut the arc. The clone is thinly sketched, but the story wisely keeps focus on Kenji’s interior shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal line from dojo confrontation → conceptual shift → court decision is clean and legible, with no orientation issues despite the high-concept world. Closure lands as a decisive change (withdrawing opposition, redefining the relationship as brotherhood) with emotional and identity cost. The structure—two anchored scenes plus world glimpses—is efficient and appropriate to length. A more concrete sense of what Kenji is materially risking in the custody battle could have heightened the stakes further, but the core drive and its resolution are solid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The floating dojo and courthouse above a reality-rewriting landscape are vivid, economical, and thematically apt, and the “brain in a jar” functions as a charged object that anchors the premise. World rules—tethering cables, reality engines, floating sanctuaries—are clear enough and consistently applied. The environment mirrors the identity instability (shifting Montana, stable sanctuaries) and subtly underwrites the theme of negotiable history vs anchored memory. Setting mostly charges meaning rather than constraining choices, which keeps it just shy of the very top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—what it means for Kenji to claim a life and self in relation to his clone—is signaled early and tightened as the hearing approaches. Internal and external conflicts intersect effectively: the custody battle gives teeth to his struggle with numbness. However, pressure at the climax is relatively soft: no on-page pushback from the judge, law, or clone tests his stance once he chooses to withdraw. The turn still feels earned, but the path of least resistance slightly blunts tension and the sense of a hard trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Identity, originality, and complementarity are coherently developed through the clone, the ego-death backstory, the shifting landscape, and the “complementary opposites” teaching. The brain jar’s re-labeled irrelevance and the assertion that “Neither of them was the duplicate. Both of them were original.” nicely crystallize the thematic question. Some thematic lines are stated a bit directly, bordering on thesis (“both real, both necessary,” “that paradox…was what it meant to feel alive”), which slightly undercuts subtlety. Still, the resonance between worldbuilding and emotional arc is strong and lingers beyond the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The third-person limited voice is steady, with a clean blend of crisp speculative diction (“reality engines,” “experimental dissolution therapy”) and more intimate interior registers. Dialogue is purposeful, subtextual, and clearly distinguishes Yoon’s incisive, cutting speech from Kenji’s flatter, carefully controlled responses. Narrative distance tightens appropriately in the courtroom scene as he finally feels the stakes. There are a few expository formulations and slightly abstract phrases, but overall the voice is confident and coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prose is generally tight, image-rich (“cables that hummed with borrowed physics,” “grief and joy braided together”) and efficient, with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Rhythm varies well between descriptive passages, dialogue, and interior pivot moments, maintaining momentum. There is occasional abstraction or label-like phrasing (“ego death,” “built new walls,” “the sensation was overwhelming”) that could be grounded more concretely, but it doesn’t materially drag or obscure. No significant loops, clutter, or figurative muddle appear, especially not at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of ego-death therapy, a brain-in-jar clone, floating sanctuaries above a reality-rewriting Earth, and a custody hearing over personhood is distinctly fresh. The idea of reframing a clone as “complement” rather than copy, tied to the martial/meditative method of complementary opposites, gives the premise thematic bite beyond standard identity-twist stories. The resolution avoids a cheap legal twist in favor of a relational and philosophical reconfiguration. While some motifs (floating dojo, reality engines) could be pushed even further into plot-level necessity, the conceptual integration already feels notably inventive.</comment>
