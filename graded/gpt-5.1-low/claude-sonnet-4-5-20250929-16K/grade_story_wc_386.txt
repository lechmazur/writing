<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya is sharply sketched: competent, obsessive about truth, and tender toward the dead, with embodied details like “diving-callused palms” grounding her. Her motivation to connect dreams to wrecks and honor the ghosts’ wishes is clear and consistent. Internal contradiction is relatively muted—she doesn’t seem to struggle or pay much emotional price in the moment, which slightly flattens the arc. Still, her final promise to the captain feels earned by the careful interpretive work earlier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The structure is clean: present-time ritual in the shrine, intercut with dream reports and the Katerina’s backstory, culminating in Maya’s realization and decision. Causality under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens holds: dream fragments → inference of the captain’s choice → plan to recover the data → sensed release of the ghost. The closure beat—ghost’s departure and Maya’s resolve—lands clearly with a legible before/after. The deduction that “you were the captain” and “you went back for the logs” borders on convenient but doesn’t quite break plausibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The glacier shrine, candles, and reflective ice are vividly rendered and tonally precise, with the aurora and “borrowed starlight” motif giving the piece a strong atmospheric spine. The snow globe sits convincingly in this environment and charges both setting and theme. While the setting doesn’t significantly constrain physical options, it clearly defines the ritual space where her work is possible and intensifies the mood of cold preservation and fragile warmth. The final image of aurora and extinguished candles elegantly ties environment to the story’s conceptual stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the Katerina’s buried climate truth can be recovered and its ghost appeased—is clear, but the on-page pressure remains mostly conceptual. There is one real tightening when Maya assembles the disparate dreams into a coherent account and commits to contacting the archives. However, there’s minimal resistance or cost; no one opposes her, and nothing on the page threatens her ability to act beyond the inherent difficulty of interpretation. The result is thematically weighty but dramatically gentle, limiting escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of climate grief, moral responsibility, and how truth travels—through data, dreams, and artifacts—are well integrated with concrete images like the preserved wreck and the melted snow globe. The idea that ghosts haunt “the edges of consciousness” dovetails with the broader notion of buried truths seeking windows back into the world. Lines like “The truth doesn’t have to stay buried with you” flirt with explicitness but feel earned by the preceding particulars rather than sermonizing. The closing aurora/borrowed starlight image offers a resonant, non-literal answer about transformation and reflection without a tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is confident, consistent, and lyrically inclined without slipping into incoherence, with a clear perceptual bias shaped by Maya’s work and obsessions. Phrases like “borrowed starlight” and “slow violence of warming seas” establish texture and cadence that suit the material. There is occasional authorial loft, but it largely feels like Maya’s reflective register rather than intrusive essaying. The psychic distance stays stable, and shifts into brief exposition are smooth and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, high information density, and metaphors that mostly deepen rather than blur (“making beauty from things that had traveled impossible distances to arrive here”). The recurring imagery of ice, flame, and starlight is handled with control rather than excess, and there are no obvious loops or scaffold sentences. A few lines edge toward purple, but they don’t muddy causality or the closure image. Overall, prose both carries atmosphere and advances story with minimal waste.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The fusion of wreck-diving, dream-haunting, and climate research feels fresh and organically conceived, not like stitched-together prompts. The notion that ghosts manifest via strangers’ dreams and can be mapped as data points is a particularly inventive twist, thematically consonant with the lost research. While some elements (a self-sacrificing captain, ethically driven truth-bearer) are familiar, their combination and the ritual glacier setting give the piece a distinct identity. The final conceptual reweighting—truth as a kind of haunting that insists on being seen—is memorable and specific.</comment>
