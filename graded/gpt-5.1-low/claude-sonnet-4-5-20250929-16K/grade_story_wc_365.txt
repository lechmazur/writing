<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kaia’s interiority is vivid and particular—her sensory-mapping cognition feels unique, and her mixture of longing, resentment, and awe around her mother is credible. Her final choice (“Teach me”) is well-motivated by the accumulated history of abandonment/protection and her professional identity. The mother is somewhat more a delivery mechanism for exposition than a fully pressured presence, but the relationship still functions as a crucible. The emotional contradiction—hurt versus understanding—could be dramatized a touch more in-scene rather than largely summarized in one paragraph.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Structure is clean: shard activates → transitions accelerate → discovery of the pocket universe → confrontation with the mother → choice. Causality holds and the multiverse travel reads as a logical progression of increasingly charged crossings, not arbitrary teleportation. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Kaia commits to learning to weave worlds, with the costs and paths freshly defined. The legality/backstory info-dump inside the reunion leans expository but does not break motivation or momentum.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport repair bay and its variant incarnations (garden, underwater, snow-blasted, pristine) are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through Kaia’s sensory-mapper perception. The bay functions as a micro-setting whose unique property (crux of universes) is essential to the premise and enables the encounter with the mother. The recurring bay and engines humming at the end nicely charge the final image. Setting could constrain tactical choices a bit more directly, but for this length it feels deeply integrated.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering what really happened to her mother and deciding where she belongs—is clear early and tightens as the shard pulls her into increasingly intense crossings. The encounter in the pocket universe effectively escalates conflict from abstract longing to an on-page choice between staying, returning, or learning to weave. The cost of each option is gestured at but not deeply dramatized; the story opts for a clean “choose growth” moment without a sharp sense of what she must forgo immediately. Still, the progression from negative-space absence to charged reunion is coherent and emotionally engaging.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of “the weight of truth” and love-as-protection-versus-abandonment emerges organically from the shard, the dreams, and the mother’s explanation. The revaluation—Kaia reframing her mother’s disappearance as both wounding and protective—reads honest and earns a quiet resonance. However, the line “The truth of abandonment, yes. But also the truth of protection…” tips toward thematic paraphrase rather than letting image and action do the work. The ending image (synchronized heartbeat, engines singing) still carries a solid, non-didactic aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The third-person close voice has a distinct sensory logic—mapping sounds and silences into colors and textures—that feels specific to Kaia and consistent throughout. Prose rhythm modulates well between lyric description and leaner, more direct lines of dialogue. Dialogue is spare but natural, with the mother’s speech slightly elevated yet fitting the quasi-mythic reunion. There are no POV slips or unmotivated distance shifts; elision around world mechanics feels confident rather than evasive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: metaphor is inventive (“a laugh that smelled like cardamom,” “a negative sound”) and mostly controlled, with few mixed or redundant images. Sentences vary in length and structure, and almost all lines do multiple jobs (world-building plus character plus mood). A couple of places verge on explanatory abstraction (“translating the untranslatable, finding paths through impossible spaces”) but they don’t stall momentum. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the final paragraph lands cleanly without purple excess.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story brings a fresh inflection to the multiverse trope through the sensory-map-maker angle and the concrete, synesthetic way of experiencing reality-folds. The green shard and repair-bay crux give the piece a distinct materiality that lifts it above generic “portal” stories. The emotional premise (a parent who vanished for your protection) is familiar but handled with enough specificity and strangeness to feel new. Overall, it reads as a cohesive, original synthesis rather than a template with new names.</comment>
