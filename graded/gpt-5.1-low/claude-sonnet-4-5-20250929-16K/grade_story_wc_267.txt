<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marta’s interiority is precise and consistent—her damaged hands, attentiveness to silence, and decision to stay all root in a coherent drive “to understand the cost of safety.” The progression from passive listening to active humming and finally to placing the bolt reads as an earned endurance rather than a sudden revelation. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (a non-reverent woman perceived as nun-like); a slightly sharper sense of flaw or self-deception could deepen the arc. Still, her final stance feels motivated and carries a visible cost in quiet defiance of management and the hotel’s ethos.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The structure is cleanly accumulative: orientation is swift, the avalanche backstory and hotel conversion are integrated without bogging, and the discovery of the ash-notes is a clear tightening turn. Causality is modest but intact—her staying, listening, and noticing lead to understanding, then to the choice to sing and to leave the bolt on the stair. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she accepts remaining in a compromised place but refuses erasure. Nothing crucial is summarized off-page, and the before/after of her stance is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress, perpetual snow, spiral staircase, and missing piano are vivid and specific, with details like the four indentations and ash-notes on steps doing heavy thematic and atmospheric work. Setting isn’t just decorative: isolation, avalanche history, and “safe” hotel conversion all constrain behavior and charge her choices. The bolt as a remnant of the conservatory and the marked staircase directly power the final image. Environment and object-as-setting undeniably charge the ending without sliding into blunt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant conflict—memory and moral witness versus institutionalized “safety” through forgetting—is clear and sharpened by guests’ complaints, management’s piped music, and the ash-mark discovery. Pressure escalates via pattern: from oppressive quiet, to evidence of deliberate remembrance, to explicit suppression of Marta’s humming, culminating in her quiet act of resistance. Stakes are mostly internal and conceptual, so the felt cost is subtle rather than visceral; there’s little sense of concrete risk beyond disapproval or job loss. For a quiet, thematic piece, the arc still tightens enough to make the final choice land.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme—the cost of safety when it demands erasure—emerges organically through setting, backstory, and Marta’s evolving response to sound and silence. Recurring images (avalanche, Silent Choir, missing piano, ash-notes, bolt) accrue resonance and reweight the premise in the final act of placing the bolt on the stair and deciding the fortress “would learn to carry sound again.” A few lines verge on overt thesis-statement (“The cost was this: a place where beauty had once echoed now swallowed every sound”), edging toward commentary rather than pure scene. Even so, the piece largely trusts images and actions to carry its conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The third-person close voice is consistent, with elegant yet controlled lyricism (“like a prayer frozen mid-ascent,” “seraphically mundane”) that clearly belongs to this narrative stance. Diction and rhythm feel deliberate, with no register breaks or POV leakage, and descriptive density supports mood without losing clarity. There’s no dialogue to test character differentiation, but internal and narrative voices align smoothly. Psychic distance stays stable, allowing reflection without slipping into abstract essaying.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and most images do at least two jobs (world-building plus thematic charge). Figurative language is frequent but not purple; metaphors are coherent and anchored to concrete detail, and there are no notable scaffold loops or synonym churn. Rhythm supports the contemplative mood while still moving forward, and the final paragraphs land with concise, weighted phrasing. I see no artifacts that blur sense or dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The blend of luxury hotel, ruined conservatory, avalanche trauma, and a bellhop quietly resisting institutional forgetting via song and a piano-bolt is distinctive. The “unpardoned silence” and focus on the ethics of safety versus remembrance offer a fresh angle on familiar ghostly-hotel and artist-martyr tropes. While the thematic territory isn’t wholly new, its synthesis of architectural memory, physical nerve regeneration, and sonic absence feels particular to this story. The risks are tonal and conceptual rather than structural, and they largely pay off.</comment>
