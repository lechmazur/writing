<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation and competence are clear and consistent, and her professional lens colors what she notices. We get embodied stress (teeth ache, vision blur, bone-deep vibration) and a credible mix of fear and determination. Internal contradiction—her “cautious hope” versus the scale of the risk—is present but only lightly dramatized. Secondary characters exist purely offstage, so relational pressure on her is mostly inferred rather than felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: discovery → departmental schism → escalating campus unrest → Mara’s risky counter-signal → tricksters’ disruption → temporary victory. Orientation in time, place, and stakes is solid from the outset, and the scene builds in a straight line to the generator’s activation and the abrupt silence. Closure is decisive—the world is different after the broadcast—and the cost is framed (potential damage, danger of amplifying them) even if it never quite bites on-page. The ending’s footsteps and dawn image land as a coherent earned resolution rather than a soft reset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The basement studio, ancient receivers, dust and ozone, and annotated charts create a specific, lived-in locus for the conflict. Environmental details (orientation of the broadcast tower, Jupiter’s field, the humming generator) directly constrain tactics and plausibly enable her plan. The “colors that shouldn’t exist” and trembling charts fuse atmosphere with stakes during the peak. The final return to the campus at dawn ties setting back into resolution without feeling postcard-like.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freeing the campus (and perhaps humanity) from manipulative cosmic signals—is clear very early and drives every move. Pressure escalates as campus unrest worsens and then sharply during the live interference attempt, with the tricksters visibly adapting and pushing back in the waveform battle. Mara’s choice to proceed despite catastrophic possible outcomes is a real test of commitment, and her active adjustments during the clash maintain agency. The ease of the aftermath (no visible backlash beyond exhaustion) slightly undercuts the sense of lasting price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of information warfare, cognitive autonomy, and the ethics of broadcasting (who controls the signal that shapes minds) emerge naturally from the premise. The cosmic tricksters’ “playful” confusion versus the campus’s brittle factionalism offers a neat, implicit commentary on how easily people are steered into division. The final image of a campus “remembering how to think for itself” is effective but edges toward explicit thesis-stating rather than letting the image alone carry the weight. Ambiguity about the tricksters’ nature and future return adds a welcome, non-didactic residue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, with a measured, technically literate tone that fits a scientist under pressure. Lexicon choices like “constructive interference,” “electromagnetic field,” and “harmonics” feel native to Mara without becoming jargon dumps. Rhythm tightens nicely around the generator sequence, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Some phrasing leans generic (“smelled of dust and ozone,” “colors that shouldn’t exist”), but overall the perceptual signature is steady and apt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose is clean, mostly economical, and often vivid, with lines doing double duty for mood and information (“the pattern revealed itself like a constellation emerging from light pollution”). Sentence variety and paragraphing keep momentum through the technical explanation into the action beat. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and clarity of cause/effect remains intact even at the peak. A few familiar constructions and metaphors prevent it from feeling truly distinctive at the highest literary tier.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The blend of campus micro-politics, student radio ephemera, and cosmic-scale psychological manipulation is a fresh-feeling synthesis. Casting the antagonist as “cosmic tricksters” who engineer polarization for sport is a clever angle on contact narratives and information warfare tropes. Using subsonic interference via a hacked college station as the mode of resistance is specific and memorable. While the arc itself tracks a fairly standard “lone expert vs. skeptical institution” pattern, the particular tooling and stakes give it a distinct identity.</comment>
