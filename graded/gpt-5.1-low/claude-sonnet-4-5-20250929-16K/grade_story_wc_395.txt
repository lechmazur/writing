<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s vocation, grief over her brother, and obsession with vanished data are clear and coherent, and her final decision to run the extraction grows logically from those traits. However, her internal conflict is underdeveloped: the risk (“even if it cost her everything”) is asserted but not deeply felt or weighed against any counter-impulse on the page. We don’t see much embodied stress or degradation of thought under pressure; she remains coolly competent throughout. A bit more contradiction—fear vs. duty, personal vs. corporate loyalty—would elevate this substantially.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The causal chain is clear: noticing one disappearance leads to a pattern, then deeper system intrusion, then the discovery of the purgatory cluster and the choice to extract. Structure is largely summary-driven (“She found the pattern on her thirty-seventh day…”) which flattens some beats that could be dramatized, but the story still lands a valid closure (Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing) when she commits to extraction. Cost remains mostly implied; there is no on-page complication or pushback from the system or other humans in the final act. Overall very coherent, but not yet at a “flawless” structural tightness or depth of on-page consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The social network archive and the “echo of forgotten songs” provide a strong, distinctive atmospheric frame, and the idea of memorials in abandoned digital corners is vivid and tonally apt. The patch functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final choice. Still, much of the archive is handled abstractly (logs, caches, servers) rather than through tactile, scene-level interaction that constrains her options. A bit more lived-in, sensory contact with the tools/environment under pressure would lift this toward the top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rescuing or at least acknowledging trapped consciousnesses, including her brother’s—is clear and potent in concept. There is one meaningful deepening when Mira discovers the backups aren’t deleted but contained, which reframes the threat as cruel stasis rather than loss. However, antagonistic pressure is soft: corporate or technical danger never sharpens into a concrete obstacle or forced trade-off on the page, so her final act reads more as a determined step than a hard choice under fire. The stakes feel high intellectually but not fully embodied or escalated in scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of memory vs. erasure, digital afterlife, and the ethics of corporate control over “souls” emerge organically from Mira’s work and her personal loss. The recurring motifs—the patch, forgotten songs, the null-state graves—reweight nicely at the end when she chooses preservation over sanctioned forgetting. At times the language edges toward explicit thesis (“digital souls in purgatory, unable to exist but prevented from being truly erased”), which slightly dulls the subtext. Still, the piece invites real reflection on what it means to “remember” in a corporate-controlled digital world.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent and well-calibrated to a technically literate but emotionally invested archivist; phrases like “digital exhaust of billions” and “ghost-paths of deleted files” feel character-appropriate. The prose modulates between efficient exposition and more lyrical touches without losing clarity. Some explanatory passages drift a bit toward omniscient-summary rather than fully inhabiting her moment-to-moment perception, which slightly flattens immediacy. Overall, the perceptual signature is distinct and controlled, just shy of truly exceptional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is generally clean, with good rhythm and minimal redundancy; sentences often carry both conceptual and emotional weight (“preserved null-state, a digital grave that somehow maintained the shape of what it once held”). The recurring number motif and repeated structures (“Then came others”) are pattern-driven rather than accidental loops. There is mild abstraction and a tendency to summarize complex investigative work rather than dramatize key steps, which lowers momentum somewhat. No serious artifacts or figurative muddle touch the closure, but the prose doesn’t quite reach that crystalline, indispensably tight level.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The fusion of a corporate memory keeper, social network graveyards, and erased astronauts whose neural backups are sequestered in a digital purgatory is striking and feels like a specific, considered synthesis rather than template SF. Using numerical artifacts (2347) as a ghostly signal running through low-level data is particularly fresh. The investigative montage and “hidden server cluster that officially didn’t exist” lean on familiar genre beats, keeping it slightly short of transformative originality. Nonetheless, the conceptual vision and emotional angle on digital afterlife stand out in a competitive field.</comment>
