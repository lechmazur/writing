<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya’s motive—to preserve Valentina’s memory against erasure—is clear, specific, and consistently embodied in her actions and perceptions. Professional competence and ritual gestures (the sand grain, the beacons) give her texture beyond a stock “scientist-activist.” Internal contradiction is present but muted: she resists “progress” without much visible doubt or irrationality, which keeps the arc from feeling fully three-dimensional. The final endurance/renunciation (accepting the crater’s loss while salvaging its image) is earned and carries a credible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The structure is clean: a single continuous operation under a time limit, oriented crisply in space and time, leading to a resonant final image. Causality is straightforward—she prepares the chemical cameras, plants the sand, dawn arrives, the reactions fire, and the photographs are taken—supporting a clear before/after. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the crater is lost physically but preserved conceptually, and Maya’s stance solidifies. What keeps this from a higher band is the relative lack of turns or complications; the plan unfolds with minimal resistance, so pressure never meaningfully kinks the causal line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lunar setting is vividly evoked—the regolith, the terminator, the temperature swing, the crater’s geology—and consistently filtered through Maya’s trained eye. Environmental constraints (vacuum, extreme temperature shifts, sunrise timing, crater slopes) directly shape tactics and lend plausibility to the chemistry-based method. The recurring images of the summit, crater floor, and dawn light culminate in a charged final tableau of Valentina “golden, eternal, and hers.” World rules stay coherent, with technical detail serving mood and stakes rather than reading like exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the last untouched crater’s image before corporate exploitation—appears early and stays coherent through to the end. The ticking clock (three hours until bulldozers, dawn approaching) gives situational pressure, and her choice to plant the grain and walk away from the coming destruction is a meaningful renunciation. However, conflict is mostly one-sided; the consortium remains offstage, and her plan meets no substantive obstacle, so escalation is more atmospheric than confrontational. The cost is emotionally legible but structurally gentle, with no real narrowing of options beyond the initial setup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of memory versus progress, time’s measurement, and the ethics of erasure arise organically from concrete particulars (the hourglass, mining consortium, crater geology, dawn photography). The story resists simple moralizing—Maya internally names it “erasure,” but the need for rare-earth elements for “quantum drives” is acknowledged, giving the conflict some complexity. The final image reweights prior motifs: the crater becomes a kind of monument and the sand grain a quiet act of defiance, embodying a belief in preservation over extraction. A few lines (“Progress, they called it. Maya called it erasure.”) lean close to thesis statement, which trims some subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The close third-person voice blends scientific precision with lyricism, yielding a recognizable perceptual signature (e.g., “the walls bore the memory of an asteroid’s kiss”). POV is steady, with no leakage and with technical terms sounding natural for Maya’s expertise. Rhythm and diction modulate well between reflective and procedural beats, and there’s no intrusive authorial commentary. Occasionally the voice slips into slightly generic formulations (“feeling nothing but knowing everything”), but these are rare and don’t disrupt control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prose is polished and efficient: most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, emotion, and motion) without visible scaffolding or repetition. Imagery is generally sharp and coherent, and technical lists (of compounds) stay rhythmic rather than wooden. Momentum holds throughout, with no dead paragraphs or explanatory loops, and the final lines land cleanly. Minor issues include a couple of familiar or slightly purple turns of phrase, but they don’t materially blur sense or dull the ending image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The blend of lunar industrialization, archival science-as-resistance, and the intimate ritual of a single sand grain offers a fresh inflection on familiar “progress vs preservation” SF territory. Using chemical dawn reactions as a photographic method and the hourglass as a personal timekeeping myth both feel particular rather than generic. The macro premise (corporate mining versus lone conservationist) is not new, but the execution’s specificity and quiet ending give it distinction. A bit more risk in either the moral calculus or the narrative turn could push this into a rarer band.</comment>
