<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lirien’s ambition, sensitivity, and resolve are clear and consistently dramatized, especially in her choice to endure three days beside the bloom. The olfactory curse/gift tension and her coping behaviors (journaling, doodling, pot placement) give her a specific psychology. Internal change—from being ruled by her sensitivity to witnessing it—is credible if slightly neat. The main limitation is how cleanly articulated her realizations are, leaving little mess or ambiguity under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal throughline—seed sought, planted, tended, bloomed, endured, then recontextualized—is clean and easy to follow, with no orientation issues. Structure folds years of pursuit into a compact frame without confusion, and the bloom sequence provides a clear focal event. Closure lands on-page as a decisive internal reconfiguration with visible cost (sustained nausea, endurance). The only weakness is a relative lack of complication or setback; the process is hard but almost frictionlessly linear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The treetop village, rope bridges, and swaying platforms are vivid and thematically aligned with “serenity within motion,” not just decorative. Environmental details (platform edge, wind to carry scent, vertical layering of neighbors) inform Lirien’s tactics and choices. The olfactory world is sharply realized and integrated into setting rather than tacked on. The atmosphere consistently supports the contemplative, slightly uncanny tone through to the final image of swaying stillness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Lirien can remain internally still while confronting a smell that assaults her greatest vulnerability—is clearly established. Pressure escalates appropriately: years of pursuit → planting → bud → full bloom and three-day ordeal, with her body “screaming to flee.” Her choice to stay and keep witnessing under worsening conditions is an earned act of agency that forecloses the easier path of avoidance. The conflict could be sharpened by one concrete near-failure or alternative temptation, as her victory feels largely uncontested once the bloom begins.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of presence, sensitivity as discipline rather than defect, and wisdom beneath ambition arise organically from events, especially the corpse flower ordeal. Recurring motifs (swaying village, journaling/doodling, scent) support a coherent thematic question. However, key insights are stated in explicit thesis form (“serenity was not the absence of disturbance,” “the greatest cultivation was not of plants, but of presence itself”), tipping into mild moralizing. That explicitness slightly blunts subtext and post-read ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and sensorially focused in a way that matches an herbalist with an exceptional nose. Diction is elevated but not implausible for the reflective frame, and the rhythm handles both description and interior commentary smoothly. Marin’s brief line fits the overall register and doesn’t break POV control. Occasional aphoristic sentences edge toward authorial rather than character voice but don’t fundamentally disrupt coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is generally tight, musical, and efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for setting, character, and theme (“like distant thunder,” “wildflower hush of dawn”). Sensory descriptions are specific without devolving into purple density, and momentum is rarely stalled by exposition. A few lines drift toward abstract summary or familiar formulation, especially in the final paragraphs, but not enough to flatten the closure image. There are no major loops, scaffolding artifacts, or figurative muddles that obscure meaning.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The combination of a corpse flower, a treetop village, extreme olfactory sensitivity, and a contemplative self-mastery arc feels fresh and thoughtfully synthesized. The family doodling custom and journaling-as-coping add idiosyncratic texture beyond standard “face your fear” narratives. The central insight is philosophically familiar, but it’s grounded in concrete, unusual particulars rather than generic symbolism. Slightly more resistance or consequence beyond internal calibration might have pushed the ingenuity higher.</comment>
