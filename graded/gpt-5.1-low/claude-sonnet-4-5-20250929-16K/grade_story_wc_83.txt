<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Amal’s motivation—grief transmuted into obsessive cosmological revenge—is specific, consistent, and drives every choice, from staying on the failing observatory to focusing the geode on the critical mass. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“pressing…scarred hands,” “screaming equations into the dark”), with a credible internal split between rational caution and nihilistic elation. What’s missing for a higher band is a sharper on-page contradiction or dilemma at the end; she never seriously entertains not pushing forward, so the final stance costs her little in newly dramatized terms.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The structure is clean: present-tense experiment framed by one well-anchored backstory shard (the wedding and geode) leading to a closure beat where the “awakening” begins. Causality is coherent—readings spike → she identifies a concentration → calculations suggest a critical mass → she chooses to intensify the experiment. Closure lands as a charged poise/early rupture rather than a resolved outcome, but the before/after is legible: the dormant pool begins to coalesce and the world’s options are irreversibly altered. The only limitation is that the narrative leans more on conceptual explanation than dramatized turns, which slightly flattens the structural snap.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The floating observatory, ruined village, and desert below are sharply realized and consistently filter through Amal’s priorities (instruments, altitude, life support, dust storms). The geode as a recurring object functions as micro-setting and tool, literally mounted in the array and physically pressed to her forehead in the final image, charging the closure. World rules around perturbations and unused futures are sketched efficiently and stay consistent, giving the speculative frame credibility without bogging it down. Atmosphere—austere, high-altitude isolation over a scarred world—perfectly matches the story’s conceptual and emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Amal will trigger or ride out a catastrophic “awakening” of killed futures—is clear and thematically potent, and pressure does increase as she identifies a massive concentration and runs critical-mass calculations. Her decision to proceed despite warnings about paradox gives the piece its main tightening beat. However, there is little countervailing force beyond her own abstraction-level caution; no external obstacle or concrete alternative path is tested on the page. The result is a rich conceptual tension with somewhat soft dramatic escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: violence as a severing of futures that must “pool” somewhere, grief as a drive to make the world feel an equivalently fractured reality, and the ethics of forcing a cosmic reckoning. The geode and imagery of ghost-weddings, unborn children, and unplanted gardens give the speculative frame emotional teeth rather than leaving it as clever metaphor. The final idea—“make survivors of everyone”—is chillingly ambiguous, reweighting prior material without spelling out a moral. A slight reliance on expository statements of the physics (“Energy couldn’t simply vanish”) keeps it just shy of top-tier subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, blending technical diction (“perturbation theory,” “quantum-locked”) with lyrical grief in a way that feels particular to Amal’s mind. Psychic distance is well controlled, tightening around peak beats (her calculations, the first coherence below, the forehead-to-geode moment). There is no head-hopping or stance drift, and the occasional elevated phrasing reads as her obsessive, quasi-mystical intellect rather than authorial intrusion. A touch more syntactic risk or tonal modulation under maximum pressure could push the voice into truly distinctive territory.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, with most doing double duty (worldbuilding plus emotion, or physics plus theme). Metaphors are apt and controlled—the futures as “oil on water,” crystals like “captured stars”—without devolving into purple prose or mixed imagery. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; momentum rarely stalls despite the conceptual load. The prose could perhaps sharpen a few abstract phrases into even more concrete sensory or tactical beats, but it’s already solidly publishable.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise—unused potential from violent deaths accumulating as a measurable, eventually catastrophic quantum reservoir—is an original and striking synthesis of physics concept and moral reckoning. Tying this to a lone, traumatized “hunter” in a decaying floating observatory, using a family geode as both scientific instrument and grief-talisman, feels genuinely fresh. The ending’s promise to “make survivors of everyone” is a non-obvious, unsettling reframe of apocalyptic stakes. It stops just short of transcendent by not yet dramatizing a uniquely unexpected tactical or ethical move within that frame.</comment>
