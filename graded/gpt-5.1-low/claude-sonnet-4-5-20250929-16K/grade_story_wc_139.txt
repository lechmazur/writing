<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira is sharply realized: the con artist’s daughter who clings to honesty, torn between her upbringing and the pragmatic ethics of asylum. Her micro-choices—refusing to forge, agreeing to wait, framing the SD card as “returning property”—all arise credibly from that conflict. Pavel is sketched economically yet distinctly, his desperation and reverence for Elena pressuring Mira without caricature. The only small limit is that Mira’s internal conflict resolves a bit smoothly given the weight of her father’s shadow; a touch more irrational fear or hesitation at the peak might deepen the cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: asylum context → missing documents → swallowed SD card → night-long vigil → retrieval and ethical framing. The story holds a single continuous scene with light interleaved backstory anchored to objects (the ink pot, prison letters) that clearly influence present choices. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mira takes a stance that honors both truth and necessity, with cost implied in her conscious alignment away from her father’s former methods. Structure is strong and proportionate to length, though the waiting interval is told rather than dramatized, keeping escalation on the quieter side.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The funeral home prep room is specific and functional: formaldehyde smell, tools, drainage, and the high windows at dawn all shape both action (the SD card recovery) and tone. The ink pot doubles as a micro-setting object that constrains Mira’s thinking and charges the final image. Occupational detail feels plausible without bogging the scene in procedure. The environment’s pressure is moral and procedural rather than physical, but it’s tightly integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stakes—Pavel’s asylum chances and Mira’s commitment to honesty—are flagged early and remain coherent throughout. Pressure deepens from abstract (“I can’t help you forge”) to concrete when the card is found and Pavel asks, “Is this legal?”, forcing Mira into a morally consequential decision. The cost is subtle but real: she chooses an interpretation of her role that edges closer to her father’s old territory while insisting on truthfulness. Escalation is compelling but restrained; the night’s wait is elided rather than used to introduce additional turns or complications.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of honesty versus survival, inherited guilt, and “fair trade” in a world of asylum and death are woven through the ink pot, Mira’s father’s letters, and Pavel’s calculus about his sister’s testimony. The mathematics motif (“one dead sister’s evidence equals one living brother’s freedom,” “only mathematics that matters”) gives the story a conceptual spine that the ending reweights toward storytelling as moral currency. The piece largely avoids sermonizing, though a couple of thematic lines border on explicit statement. Overall, the resonance is strong and lingers beyond the plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is steady, with Mira’s perceptions shaping diction and metaphor (truth as clay, bureaucracy as fortress, songs like wind through mountain passes). Dialogue sounds human and goal-directed, efficiently advancing stakes while revealing character. The narrative register is elevated but consistent with Mira’s reflective nature and never feels like authorial intrusion. Psychic distance modulates smoothly between concrete action and reflection without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is controlled and vivid, with layered sentences that often do double duty for atmosphere and character (e.g., “deathly vitality that bodies sometimes held in preparation”). Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and syntax varies enough to keep rhythm alive. There are no significant loops or scaffolding; every paragraph either advances the situation or reweights the thematic frame. A few phrases (“impossible mathematics,” “spaces where honesty and necessity finally converged”) tilt slightly toward abstraction but do not materially dull the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The combination of a funeral home prep room, a con artist’s scrupulously honest child, and a microSD swallowed by an asylum seeker feels fresh and specific. The notion of “waiting actively” for contraband testimony to emerge from a corpse as an ethical act is particularly inventive. The story follows through on its unusual premise with emotionally grounded stakes rather than leaning on twistiness. It’s not radically experimental, but it offers a distinct, memorable angle on political and moral dilemmas.</comment>
