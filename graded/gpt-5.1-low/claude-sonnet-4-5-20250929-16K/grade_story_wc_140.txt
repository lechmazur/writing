<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist is vivid: a legally dead ex-chemist turned “ghost” archivist with clear, consistent motivation rooted in her erasure and guilt. Her interiority is specific (the plant logo as “scar tissue,” the texture of memories as “rough”) and her micro-choices (where she positions herself, what she notes) align with that drive. What’s missing at this level is on-page contradictory impulse or a pressured decision; she’s already fully committed to her role, so we don’t see her pay a fresh emotional price in scene. The ending stance feels more affirmed than changed, which limits depth of character turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The accumulative structure—moving with the tides, gathering fragments—coheres and is easy to follow, with a clear throughline from label → investigation → purpose. The drive lens is textural: each overheard story deepens the sense of cover-up and stakes. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she crystallizes into “keeper of erased histories,” but it’s a conceptual cadence rather than a decisive on-page turn under new pressure. Because no new constraint or revelation in the final beats materially alters her options, the arc feels strong but not yet fully sharpened.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The port and container labyrinth are richly realized and consistently filtered through her perception: “aluminum canyon walls,” barnacled pilings, tide levels tied to access and eavesdropping. Setting is not just backdrop; the maze affords concealment, channels voices, and literally houses her. The rhythms of tide and shift work structure when she can gather stories, giving the environment real tactical weight. This is just shy of top-tier because the setting doesn’t quite impose a hard constraint or crisis at the end—it frames her vocation rather than tightening a choice there.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering a deliberately erased corporate poisoning and, by extension, restoring erased histories—is clear and thematically charged. However, conflict remains largely off-stage and historical: dock workers and ex-employees reminisce, but no one resists her, and no concrete obstacle tests her commitment in the present scene. The pressure does deepen as she descends to older workers and more traumatic memories, yet there’s no real escalation in cost or narrowing of options. The ending is a reaffirmation of an ongoing mission rather than a turn forced by rising stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Erasure—of legal identity, corporate crimes, community memory—organically unifies character, setting, and plot, and the cyanide label and sedimentary metaphors reinforce this without feeling arbitrary. The idea of truth as toxic residue that “refused to dissolve in salt water or time” is strong and lingers. The final paragraph edges into thesis language (“keeper of erased histories, collector of toxic truths”), tipping toward explicit statement instead of trusting image alone. Still, the thematic resonance is coherent and emerging from particulars rather than imposed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The close third-person voice has a consistent, slightly lyrical register that feels apt for a liminal “ghost” figure—precise yet haunted, with good control of metaphor and rhythm. Focalization stays cleanly anchored in her perceptions; we never slide into other minds, and the narrative certainty matches what she can plausibly infer. The diction (“sedimentary evidence,” “filter reality differently”) is elevated but believable for a former lab worker who has turned her life into an investigative project. It’s distinctive and controlled, though not yet so idiosyncratic as to feel unmistakable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, clean, and information-dense, with metaphors that mostly reinforce the central imagery of tides, containers, and sediment. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase-looping; nearly every line earns its keep. A few abstractions and repetitions in the last paragraph (“purpose,” “keeper of erased histories,” “toxic truths”) slightly thin the immediacy and tip toward slogan. Overall, though, rhythm and clarity are well maintained without purple excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—legally dead whistleblower living as a “ghost” in a container labyrinth, reconstructing a vanished chemical plant via overheard fragments—is fresh and conceptually cohesive. The erased-identity premise is familiar, but the specific shipping-port ecology, tide-based patterning, and focus on bureaucratic erasure over spectacle feel distinctive. Emotional and political stakes come from grounded particulars (sick neighborhoods, malformed baby, NDAs) rather than generic dystopian gestures. It stops short of truly daring risk or a surprising final reweighting, but it’s notably above-average in originality and integration.</comment>
