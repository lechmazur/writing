<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is specific and textured—her “hauntingly practical” grief, the way she translates memories into gestures carved in wood, all feel deeply individuated. Motivation is clear and consistent: she carves to hold Viktor’s presence in a form congruent with her understanding of impermanence. What keeps this slightly below top-tier is the relative absence of in-the-moment contradictory impulses; she moves through the scene with calm, resolved purpose more than live inner conflict. Still, the closing acceptance (“someone who could hold loss without being crushed by it”) is credibly earned by everything preceding it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The structure—a single continuous scene framed by the kettle and the changing light, with embedded flashback/reflection—reads clean and deliberate under an accumulative/textural lens. Causality is modest but coherent: grief → refusal of photos → discovery of carving method → current carving of laughter → quiet acceptance at the end. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: she recommits to this practice, with the shelf and the new figure reweighting what “remaining” means. Reflection is well-anchored in present sensory cues and never blurs where or when we are.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The loft with its rain-beaded skylight, the kettle, the ash wood, and the tools create a vivid, lived-in micro-setting that mirrors her interior state without feeling like blunt symbolism. Weather and light evolve (“pearl to slate”) in tandem with the work, subtly time-stamping the emotional progression. The tent world and lions appear as remembered setting that meaningfully contextualize her philosophy of impermanence. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain her choices, it does charge the final image and serve as an effective “ring” for this quiet performance of grief.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how Mira will live with Viktor’s absence—is clear, and the story deepens that question through the decision to carve laughter rather than a safer or flatter moment. Pressure is internal and low-key, accumulating rather than spiking; the main tightening is the movement from intention (“the blank before her now would become his laugh”) to the finished figure joining the “gallery of gestures.” The cost is the ongoing demand of love “even after death” and the acceptance that she must keep carving rather than retreating into static mourning. It’s strong quiet conflict, though escalation is more steady accretion than a sharply felt turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Impermanence, the futility and necessity of containment, and art as a way to live with grief emerge naturally from the specifics of circus life, lions, wood, and gesture. Recurring images—rain on glass, here/gone crowds, the gallery of carved moments—build a resonant answer to how one might “harvest lessons from loss.” The closing paragraph’s “what only grief could teach” edges toward explicit thematic statement, nudging into mild didacticism. Even so, the emotional aftereffect is earned and unsentimental, with enough complexity in her stance to avoid feeling like a neat moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, confident, and distinctly Mira’s in its blend of tactile craft detail and reflective, slightly poetic thought. Syntax and rhythm modulate well—longer, lusher sentences for reflection, tighter ones for small actions like silencing the kettle. Lexicon fits someone practical yet contemplative; there’s no head-hopping or register slippage. The perceptual signature (what she notices, how she analogizes Viktor’s lion training to woodcarving and grief) feels specific and memorable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and dense with meaning; images like “the blank…waited like an unanswered question” and “a gallery of gestures, a museum of moments” are fresh and precise. Figurative language is present but controlled, rarely tipping into excess, and most lines do double duty for atmosphere and character. There is a slight tendency toward thematic phrasing (“harvesting lessons from loss,” “what only grief could teach”) that reads a bit essayistic but doesn’t seriously blunt momentum. No notable loops or scaffolding artifacts; the final sentences land cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fusion of a circus lion tamer’s widow, grief work, and the practice of carving not likenesses but “moments themselves” feels genuinely fresh. The notion of crystallized gestures as a museum of time, and of ash wood as an honest interlocutor akin to lions, raises this above more generic mourning/art pieces. The arc is quiet and not structurally radical, but the specific synthesis of vocation, environment, and coping method reads as an authentic, non-obvious vision. Risks are taken more in conceptual framing and image system than in plot, but they pay off.</comment>
