<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mirela’s motivations are clear and consistent—protecting the orchards and the communal ethic—and Kess’s pivot from hoarding to sharing is credibly rooted in grief and fear. The ghost’s agency in shifting tactics from fading messages to burning ones shows adaptive, goal-driven behavior. However, interior contradiction is sketched rather than deeply inhabited; we’re told Kess’s fear, but we don’t spend much time in her body or mind under pressure. Relationships function symbolically (ghost ↔ community) more than as a fully dramatized crucible between individuated people.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: Mirela senses fracturing → escalates her messaging → resource-sharing improves → surplus draws outside pressure → her climactic message catalyzes a decisive communal choice. The global drive is Causal with a clear Decisive Change: they refuse individual enrichment and choose cooperative trade, allowing Mirela to rest. Cost is legible in the foregone wealth and in how hard-won their trust is, carried from war trauma into this vote. Structure is efficient and cohesive for the length, with no orientation debt or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The orchard planet, low gravity droplets, floating rock arches, and the nebula of respite are vividly rendered and recur in charged ways, especially the arches and nebula framing the collective moments. Setting and object details (butterfly gardens, bells, domes) feel lived in and integrated with action. However, the environment mostly supports tone and symbolism rather than imposing concrete constraints or tactical limits on choices. As a result, it’s beautifully atmospheric and thematically apt, but just shy of using place as an active pressure on decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether this refugee community will uphold a collective ethic or slide back into extractive individualism—is clearly signaled and tightened by the arrival of the merchant ship. Mirela’s shift from logistical messages (“pruning,” “share the bells”) to the moral crux (“I DIED SO YOU COULD LIVE DIFFERENTLY”) effectively escalates the conflict into a value decision. The unanimous vote reads a bit too easy; we don’t see a truly contested or costly debate, so the ethical conflict resolves without much on-page resistance. Still, there is a meaningful narrowing of options and a real, if somewhat idealized, trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of mutual aid vs. corporate exploitation, intergenerational inheritance, and the danger of recreating old systems emerge coherently from concrete actions (hoarding, sharing, trade choice). The recurring motif of messages—ending with the living taking up the chalk—nicely embodies the idea of collective, ongoing stewardship. However, the line “I DIED SO YOU COULD LIVE DIFFERENTLY” and the final cooperative resolution tilt into moral clarity and sermonizing rather than embracing much ambiguity. The piece leaves a strong emotional aftereffect, but the answer to its central question is more declared than discovered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with phrases like “brambled with hope and grief” giving it a distinct texture. The narrator’s omniscient stance is steady and doesn’t leak into confusing head-hopping; it handles time-compression and summary gracefully. Rhythm varies well, balancing long, image-rich sentences with punchier declarative lines at key turns (the capitalized messages, the final “I CAN REST NOW”). Occasionally the diction edges toward sentimentality, but it remains under control and in line with the story’s fable-like tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line by line, the prose is clean, with strong images (droplets drifting “like tears,” arches as “bridges of rose and gold”) and efficient exposition woven into scene. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy; most sentences do double duty for worldbuilding and emotional charge. A few phrases and structures recur (“strangers became family”) and the imagery verges on purple in places, but it rarely muddies clarity or momentum. The closure image—chalk taken up by the living under the violet sky—lands crisply and recharges earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of an altruistic ghost organizer, refugee agro-commons on an orchard planet, and spectral chalk messages as community governance feels fresh and memorable. Familiar elements (corporate wars, trade temptation) are enlivened by specific, non-generic details like butterfly bells in low gravity and the nebula as a kind of cosmic blessing. The final handoff from ghost to community is an elegant conceptual turn that fits both premise and theme. Some beats (evil-ish merchant offer, unanimous virtuous vote) lean on well-trodden moral territory, but the overall vision is distinctive.</comment>
