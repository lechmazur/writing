<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mara’s motivations (professional duty vs. ancestral memory) are clear and specific, and her choice to defy orders grows credibly from those traits. Her interiority is rendered with concrete ties to family history rather than abstractions. The main limitation is that her internal conflict is more implied than dramatized on the page, with little moment-to-moment vacillation or real doubt at peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal chain from drought → resurfacing town → photograph trail → bureaucratic order → Mara’s counterproposal → community return is clean and satisfying. Structure holds as a single, coherent arc with a clear before/after in institutional intent toward Valserre. Closure lands via her decisive act and its visible effects, though the professional consequences to her remain gestured at rather than concretely tested.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The reservoir, ridgeway, mudbanks, drowned town, and wind chime create a vivid, lived-in physical world filtered through Mara’s professional gaze. The resurfacing landscape actively shapes what’s possible (exposing the town, enabling the memorial visits), and the recurring wind chime charges the final image. Some description leans slightly toward the lyrical-touristic, but overall it’s purposeful and thematically aligned.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The central conflict—Mara’s duty to “safety” versus preserving erased histories—is clearly framed and tightens when the county demands a “clean slate.” Her counter-move (the memorial proposal and broad dissemination) is an earned escalation that forecloses compliance. However, the opposing pressure from the county remains mostly offstage and is resolved somewhat easily by communal response, softening the sense of real cost or narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of institutional erasure versus communal memory are well embodied in the resurfacing town, the photographs, and the language of “expunge”/“clean slate.” The final sequence of descendants reclaiming space and the chime breaking the hush offers resonant imagery. That resonance is slightly undercut by explicit statement (“She understood now that some things should never be expunged”), which edges toward moralizing instead of fully trusting the images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, with a measured, slightly lyrical texture that suits Mara’s reflective vigilance. Sentence rhythms vary and the diction feels unified without drifting into anachronistic register. The narrative stance remains firmly anchored in her perceptions and professional sensibility, avoiding head-hopping or unmotivated omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is generally lean yet evocative, with strong images like “skeletal structures breaking the waterline like accusations” and “mirrored hush of the exposed lakebed.” Most sentences carry multiple functions (setting, mood, character) without redundancy. A few phrases nudge toward purple or conceptual (“spin stories into shared meaning”), but they don’t significantly stall momentum or blur clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The premise of a resurfacing drowned town is familiar, yet the focus on a levee warden descendant leveraging bureaucracy to resist a second erasure gives it a fresh inflection. The photograph trail and the bureaucratic language of expunging contribute specific, non-generic touches. It doesn’t quite achieve an unexpected, inevitable twist of concept, but it is thoughtfully and distinctively executed within its lane.</comment>
