<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Layla’s interiority is rich, embodied, and specific, with clear contradictory impulses (urge to dissociate vs. deliberate grounding) playing out in scene, especially around the helicopter pass. Her choices—taking the job, tending the plants, walking to the glass wall, returning to the children—are motivated by a coherent survival ethic and culminate in an earned stasis (“to freeze when she must, then thaw again”). The relationship to Samir, though off-page, feels real and charged via the photograph and casualty count. Slightly clinical phrasing (“somatic markers,” “the body keeps score”) pulls a bit of texture away from pure character-particular thought in a couple of lines.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The structure is clean and accumulative: a single continuous morning anchored by routine, backstory woven in via present cues, and a helicopter-triggered spike that tightens everything introduced earlier. Causality under a textural lens is clear—sensory triggers → somatic panic → chosen coping strategy → renewed engagement with work. Closure lands as an earned stasis/charged poise: she reaffirms tending what can grow despite unresolvable loss, with tangible cost acknowledged. No orientation or lens ambiguity issues; the lighthouse/automation frame cleanly bookends without overexplaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The arboretum on the cliff is vivid and integral: salt wind, glass walls, the sweep of the automated beacon, and the waves she counts all shape her coping tactics and the final image. Details are selective and POV-filtered (Mediterranean specimens, soil moisture, coastal gales) and they track her professional competence and trauma sensitivity. The environment literally gives her the tool for survival (glass wall and sea rhythm) and thematically mirrors persistence on an eroding edge. Sensory balance is strong, with scent (lavender, herbs) in the final lines grounding the moment in “this specific now.”</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether she can endure triggers without being consumed—appears early and is tested concretely by the incoming school group and the helicopter’s sudden intrusion. Pressure escalates from background description of PTSD responses to a live panic episode that forces her to choose between spiraling and using her practiced grounding method. The cost is ongoing and credible: she does not “get over” anything but recommits to functioning in a world that can still ambush her. It’s a quiet escalation without multiple turns, but for this length and mode the single decisive tightening works.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of survival after spectacle-level violence, the ethics of attention vs automation, and the difficulty of living in the “endless, ordinary after” emerge organically from action and repeated images (beacon, plants, photograph, waves). The “pearl of stillness” metaphor reweights the whole piece, reframing coping not as cure but as the slow accretion of tolerable moments around an unremovable irritant. The final paragraphs avoid moralizing, instead offering a resonant answer: tending what can still grow is both insufficient and the only available work. A couple of lines (“the body keeps score,” “anchor optimism in realism”) brush the edge of thematic labeling but remain grounded enough in specifics not to feel like sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, restrained, and textured, with a clear perceptual signature shaped by horticultural expertise and hypervigilance. Sentence rhythm modulates well—more expansive when she’s in routine, tighter and more clipped as panic approaches—without becoming mannered. Lexicon is mostly character-plausible, and free-indirect access is clean, with only minor register lifts on psych jargon that don’t disrupt stance. There’s no dialogue, but the narrative voice carries subtext about grief, guilt, and endurance effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lean, precise, and generally high-density: images usually do two jobs (worldbuilding and emotional mirroring), and there’s minimal scaffolding or redundant phrasing. The extended metaphors (pearl of stillness, “body keeps score”) are controlled and paid off rather than tossed in for decoration. A faint whiff of therapy-speak and a couple of summary sentences shading toward explanation rather than dramatization keep this just below the very top band. Overall, rhythm, clarity, and momentum are strong and support the quiet stakes well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The core elements—a PTSD survivor gardener on a cliffside arboretum, an automated lighthouse as backdrop, and the “pearl of stillness” as coping metaphor—combine into a fresh-feeling synthesis even though each component is individually familiar. The story takes a modest structural risk by committing to a very small, interior window and trusting accumulation and image instead of overt plot twists, which largely pays off. Emotional truth around survivor’s guilt and hyperarousal feels specific rather than templated. It stops short of a truly surprising reconfiguration, but its integration of automation vs human care and trauma vs growth is thoughtfully executed.</comment>
