<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera is specific, consistent, and motivated: the Silent Skipper whose attention expresses care, and whose decisive act—building the cairn and promising to return—feels earned by the history of letters and stones. Her emotional life is embodied in details like the ache in her chest and her rough, unused voice, though internal contradiction (fear vs duty, distance vs connection) stays more implied than dramatized in on-page back-and-forth. The ghosts function more as a conceptual presence than as individuated characters, which keeps relational pressure muted. Overall, the arc from silent observer to active guardian is convincing but could use one sharper moment of doubt or resistance under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The structure is cleanly accumulative: the backstory of letters, the vanished keeper, and the pattern of stones all funnel into the present-night crisis when the lamp dies and the final letter awaits. Causality holds—her prior choice to answer enables this culminating exchange—and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where Vera assumes the guardianship chain with a visible emotional cost. The shift from automated emptiness to a consciously inhabited, tended haunt reads as a clear before/after. Stakes and timeline are legible, with no orientation confusion or broken set-ups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lantern room and lighthouse are vivid and functionally integrated: the Fresnel lens, sea-weathered glass, scratched messages, and stacked stones all shape what Vera notices and what she can do. The setting is not just mood; it constrains choice (her ritual actions are bound to this room, these stones, this glass) and directly charges the final image of the cairn with the blue sea glass flame. Environmental details like the pale gold dawn and the sense of “air embracing her” tie atmosphere tightly to thematic resolution. The world feels specific and lived-in without excess exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The conflict is primarily internal and philosophical—how to respond to unseen, exhausted guardians and the loneliness of watch-keeping—so the stakes are emotional and ethical rather than survivalist. There is a clear escalation when the lamp goes out and the final letter announces the ghost’s impending departure, narrowing Vera’s options to silence or a committed reply. However, opposition is soft; nothing really pushes back against her choice once she decides to answer, so the tension curve is more deepening than sharply tightening. The cost is present (ongoing duty and emotional vulnerability) but understated on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of guardianship, witnessing, and “who protects the protectors” emerge organically from the lighthouse context, the ghosts, and Vera’s actions, especially the idea of the stone cairns as “small lighthouses” and an “eternal chain of guardianship.” The final commitment reweights earlier motifs effectively, particularly stones and light. However, some lines move into explicit thesis (“This was how you bottled safety: you built monuments to witnessing…”) and explanatory statements that edge toward sermonizing rather than trusting image and implication. The piece still leaves a resonant emotional aftertaste, but with less ambiguity than top-tier literary work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a perceptual signature rooted in Vera’s watchful, laconic nature and maritime life (e.g., “blue as forgetting,” “radiant and painful as lamp oil burning clean”). Diction is lyrical but mostly within plausible reach for this character, and psychic distance stays stable. The single spoken line lands with weight because of her prior silence, showing modulation in rhythm and register at the right moment. There is minor drift toward generalized-poetic abstraction, but it doesn’t materially disturb POV integrity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is largely tight, rhythmic, and purposeful, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character, and minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent and on-theme, and the narrative moves forward without bogging down in loops. A few phrases lean toward purple or generalized (“light and longing,” “pure and absolute”) and slightly dilute edge, but they don’t obscure clarity or closure. Line-level control is strong enough for competitive venues, if not yet at the very rarefied top.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Haunted lighthouse ghosts are familiar, but the specific inflection—anonymous letter-and-stone exchanges, ghosts as protectors of the protectors, and “bottling safety” through cairns—is fresh and emotionally grounded. The choice to center a supply skipper rather than a keeper, and to make attention and response the key heroism, gives the piece a non-obvious angle. Still, some thematic and imagistic moves (lonely watch, light vs dark, “we all become ghosts”) align closely with well-trodden territory. The story feels strong and particular rather than generically derivative, but it stops short of fully surprising synthesis.</comment>
