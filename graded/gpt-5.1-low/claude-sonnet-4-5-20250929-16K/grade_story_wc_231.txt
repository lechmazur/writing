<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Margit is clearly motivated by professional duty and a deeper need to understand grief, and her final act of releasing the flower is credibly earned. The lighthouse-keeper lens and her habit of “observing gaps” give her a distinct interiority. However, her inner conflict at the end is relatively smooth; there’s limited sense of true resistance to letting the memories go. A touch more contradiction in her desire to keep/banish Ernst’s memories would deepen the characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: discovery of the body → discovery of the flower → onset of memories → return to the dock to decode the gesture → decision to release the Edelweiss. The structure alternates present investigation with memory-shards in a controlled way that leads to a clear conceptual repricing at the end. Closure lands solidly with Margit’s choice to let the memories sink, carrying a visible emotional cost. A minor weakness is the slightly expository info-dump about Ernst’s research, which could be more dramatized but doesn’t break causality or closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The misty opal dock, harbor, and lighthouse are economical yet vivid, and the environment’s “witnessed isolation” meaningfully frames Ernst’s act and Margit’s decoding of it. Setting details are filtered through Margit’s long familiarity, which keeps them from feeling touristic. The recurring dock and water constrain the final choice—she can literally discard the flower only here. The Edelweiss-as-object functions almost as micro-setting for the mind, charging the final image of it sinking.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Margit will cling to or relinquish the burden of Ernst’s borrowed grief—is signaled early and tightened through each successive memory. Pressure escalates as she uncovers Ernst’s purpose and the origin of the flower, culminating in her choice to drop it. The conflict is mostly internal and quiet but coherent, and the cost (loss of connection and insight) is legible. Some beats of “investigation” feel reflective rather than actively pressured, keeping this just shy of truly intense escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of grief, the inadequacy of preservation, and the danger of becoming a “museum” of memory arise organically from the premise and Margit’s choice. The Edelweiss and the lighthouse’s indifferent continuity give strong, image-based thematic support. However, lines like “They were ghosts. Beautiful, perfect, and utterly separate from living” and “not preservation, but permission to let go” edge into explicit thesis-stating. The resonance is real but somewhat over-articulated, slightly flattening the ambiguity and complexity this material could sustain.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, measured, and well-suited to an older lighthouse keeper who thinks in observation and pattern. The diction is controlled and occasionally lyrical without drifting into an alien register for Margit. Expository passages about neural interfaces and silicate compounds skirt the edge of authorial explanation but are anchored via the memory experiences well enough to stay within a plausible narrative stance. Overall the perceptual signature—attentive to gaps, tides, and routine—is distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prose is generally tight, with varied sentence rhythms and a good balance between atmosphere and forward motion. Metaphors like “softly persistent, like waves wearing down stone” are apt and restrained rather than piled-on. There are no meaningful loops, syntactic templates, or muddled images, and the final paragraph lands cleanly at the line level. A few explanatory sentences about the technology read slightly flatter than the rest, but they don’t seriously drag momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The fusion of a remote Norwegian lighthouse, an Alpine funeral flower as memory-storage, and a cognitive researcher’s grief is an unusually specific and fresh constellation. Borrowed memories via a physical object are familiar SF territory, but the Edelweiss choice and “museum of his own grief” inflection feel particular and emotionally grounded. Using a solitary lighthouse keeper to decode a stranger’s final gesture through gaps in memories is an elegant, non-obvious angle. It stops short of truly radical innovation, but the synthesis is distinctive and cohesive.</comment>
