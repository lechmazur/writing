<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s core drives—curiosity and the urge to protect “vulnerable voices”—are clear and consistently enacted, and her job-specific interiority feels particular rather than generic. However, we rarely see genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulses under pressure; she moves smoothly from curiosity to action without a felt moral or personal cost. Secondary figures (the boy, Elena, the authorities) are entirely off-page, so relationships do not become crucibles in scene. The final “incidental heroism” beat lands, but with limited sense of what it deeply changes in Mara beyond a quiet satisfaction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean and legible: unusual pulse → investigation → records search → realization of danger → targeted call → rescue and emotional resolution. The piece delivers a clear closure unit (Decisive Change + small Resonant Reconfiguration) when the hearing aid goes silent and joins the archive, establishing a before/after. Some steps feel slightly convenient—the speed/ease of trawling records and the unquestioning acceptance of her lead by police—but they don’t break plausibility at this length. Structure (single scene with past fragments) is tidy and supports the central drive without unnecessary detours.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium, ferns leaning toward secrets, and twilight atmosphere are vivid and thematically apt, giving the piece a clear, specific locus. Setting is filtered through Mara’s work—devices, hospital records, the old carnival photo—rather than reading like a neutral backdrop. While the atrium and mist don’t strongly constrain tactical options, the twilight window and the device-as-tool function as a micro-setting that charges the final image when the mist lifts and the hearing aid is archived. Detail is economical and rarely drifts into decorative list-making.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The stakes—delivering a dead boy’s message and preventing his sister’s suicide—are established and escalate credibly as Mara realizes the pulse is a warning, not just a farewell. There is a meaningful tightening when Elena is revealed as missing and suicidal, which reweights the situation from curiosity to urgent intervention. However, conflict feels slightly frictionless: Mara encounters no serious pushback from systems or herself, and her first hypothesis (the carnival) proves immediately correct. The price paid is mostly emotional strain and reputational risk, which are present but underplayed on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of grief, lingering connection, and quiet, unintended heroism arise organically from the hearing aid/photograph motif and Mara’s role. The final image of the archive of “quieted devices” and the lifting mist offers a gentle, resonant answer about the value of listening to marginal voices. That said, the phrasing around “heart she’d helped trace back to wholeness” and “vulnerable voices would call again” edges toward explicitness and tidiness, trimming ambiguity. The piece hints at deeper questions (ethics of her work, boundaries between living and dead) without fully pressing into their more troubling contours.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is steady, controlled, and suited to the material, with a mild lyricism that fits the haunted-technological premise. Diction and syntax remain consistent with Mara’s perceptual frame; omniscient overreach or head-hopping never intrude. Some turns of phrase are familiar, but others (“contact tracer for hearts,” “electromagnetic signatures of grief”) give the narration a distinct flavor. The voice could push further into idiosyncrasy under peak stress, but as is it’s polished and coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line-level writing is clear, mostly economical, and carries good rhythm; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, premise, or plot. There are mild redundancies and a slight tendency toward repeated cadences (“The X…” sentence openings), but not enough to stall momentum. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and there are no mixed metaphors or register jolts. The final paragraphs in particular balance summary and image smoothly, bringing the piece to a clean cadence without an expository dump.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The central conceit—devices retaining electromagnetic “signatures” of grief and a specialist who traces them—is a fresh and memorable inflection on ghost-contact tropes. Folding this into a quasi-bureaucratic hospital role and a grounded, specific case (a lost hearing aid, a suicidal teen) keeps it from feeling like a generic paranormal hook. The “incidental heroism” angle adds a non-obvious moral texture, even if the resolution is slightly neat. With a bit more risk in how the world resists Mara, this could feel fully singular; as is, it’s notably inventive and coherent.</comment>
