<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s guilt, professional rigor, and evolving relationship to uncertainty are rendered with textured interiority and clear, embodied stakes. Her flaw (overconfidence in “reasonable” filters) directly fuels the past tragedy and the present recalibration choice, which feels both inevitable and costly. The swallowed-truth motif (“like a stone”) pays off well in the ballast image at the end. Chen functions minimally but effectively as a gentle counter-pressure rather than a full crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The structure is clean: present-moment observation → illness/backstory shard → confession reveal → recalibration decision, all causally linked under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure is strong via a resonant reconfiguration—Mira commits to a new forecasting stance with acknowledged cost (“more false positives”) and internal reweighting of margins. The avalanche itself remains offstage but sufficiently grounded; nothing crucial feels withheld or patched. Slightly more on-page friction around implementing the recalibration could have deepened the sense of a present-time turning point.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mountain station, thin air, aurora, snowpack sensors, and ecotone flowers are vivid and highly selective, all clearly filtered through a weather scientist’s gaze. Setting is not decorative: instruments, altitude, and avalanche history directly shape both memory and current options, and the illustration-as-object functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Weather and light shifts (aurora to dawn to sun) track with emotional progression. A hair more tactile engagement with the physical station during the recalibration beat could push this into truly exceptional territory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The central stake—whether Mira will continue to filter out marginal anomalies or fundamentally change her method—is clear early and tightens as the piece juxtaposes her prior “fault-tolerant” choice with Eva’s death. Pressure remains mostly internal but escalates credibly from recollection to a concrete procedural decision with nontrivial professional costs (“less certain…more false positives”). The Chen exchange provides a small external test of resolve rather than real opposition, keeping the conflict somewhat low-key. The emotional cost of living with more alarms could be sharpened slightly to heighten the sense of trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of uncertainty, margins vs. centers, and the ethics of probabilistic knowledge are organically braided through snow models, botanical art, and the avalanche. The closing ballast image and “forecast from the margins” line reweight earlier material in a satisfying conceptual repricing. There is minor over-articulation (“certainty is what killed her”) that edges toward thesis-statement, slightly dulling the subtextual power already present in the images. Nonetheless, the piece avoids tidy morality and lets the cost of her new stance remain live and complex.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, precise, and plausibly matches a scientifically trained but grieving mind—technical terms sit comfortably beside lyric observation. Psychic distance modulates well, tightening around key realisations without head-hopping, and Chen’s brief dialogue feels natural and distinct. The prose maintains a recognizable perceptual signature (attention to thresholds, error margins, edges) that deepens character. Occasional explicitly thematic phrasing slightly flattens what is otherwise a very confident narrative stance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythm, high information density, and images that generally pull double duty (e.g., the smudge as both physical accident and thematic bruise). There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy; almost every line either advances emotional stakes or sharpens motif. A few phrases verge on overtly emblematic or expository (“Truth lives in the edges,” “certainties killed her”), nudging toward mild overstatement in an otherwise finely tuned piece. The final paragraph lands cleanly, with the ballast metaphor providing a resonant and clear closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of avalanche science, statistical fault-tolerance, and botanical marginalia as a frame for grief and responsibility feels fresh and specific. Using calibration thresholds and error margins as the battleground for mourning a sister’s death is a non-obvious but convincing angle. Recurring edge/margin imagery risks slight repetition but ultimately achieves a coherent, memorable conceptual tapestry. The piece takes a quiet but genuine risk in centering a technical, interior recalibration rather than overt drama, and it mostly pays off.</comment>
