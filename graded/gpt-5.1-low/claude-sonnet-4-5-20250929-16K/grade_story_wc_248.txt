<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marina’s motivation—honoring Kiran’s promise and countering erasure—feels specific, sustained, and drives every present-tense choice. Her interiority has strong, concrete touches (“volcanic tenderness,” the way she handles the tapestry and portrait) rather than generic grief. However, her moral and psychological contradictions (arsonist vs conservator, guilt vs righteousness) are largely summarized rather than dramatized under pressure in the moment, keeping her just short of truly layered complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The causal drive is clean: arsons → going off-grid → following artistic breadcrumbs → archive → decoding → decision to broadcast. Closure lands as a charged choice to leak everything, with emotional cost (risk, grief, permanent outlaw status) legible on the page. The structure is mostly one continuous scene with backstory efficiently braided in, but opposition and complication are almost entirely off-stage, so the climax feels a touch frictionless.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The basalt-cliff archive, carved narratives, dry air preserving textiles, and the hidden chamber are vivid, purposeful details that feel filtered through Marina’s conservator eye. Environment directly enables and shapes action (the carved “trail of artistic creations,” the preserved tapestry, the difficulty of the climb back to daylight). The final image of “the watching walls” and “stone memory keeping faith” clearly charges the ending, though another sensory layer (temperature, sound, smell) could deepen immersion further.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stakes—rescuing the Tethani’s truth and Kiran’s legacy from erasure—are clear and high, and the narrative tightens as Marina moves from discovery to decoding to committing to a global leak. Internal and external stakes are well intertwined, especially around the vandalized portrait and the decision to go public. However, the on-page conflict is largely procedural and unopposed: she encounters no significant setbacks, time pressure, or true dilemma in the archive, softening the sense of escalation and cost in the scene itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of institutional erasure, art as counter-archive, and promises as acts of resistance are woven tightly through the objects (tapestry, portrait) and Marina’s choices. The ending resonates by reweighting “arsonist” vs “archivist” and insisting that the Tethani and Kiran can no longer be erased. Some thematic material is delivered in a slightly expository list (“Corporate interests… Academic gatekeepers… Government officials…”) rather than purely through image and implication, which makes the argument a touch on-the-nose.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled, slightly elevated diction that matches Marina’s analytical, trained-conservator mind and the story’s archaeological subject. Phrases like “archive breathed with presence” and “stone memory keeping faith” give the narrative a distinct texture without obscuring clarity. Occasionally, the voice edges toward essayistic (“poisoned donations,” the explicit catalog of bad actors), nudging away from pure character-filtered perception, but not enough to break cohesion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with images that usually do double duty for atmosphere and theme. There’s minimal redundancy and no major figurative muddle; the prose moves the story forward without getting lost in ornament. A few lines feel a bit explanatory or slogan-like (“She had burned the weapons aimed at Kiran’s life work”), which slightly dulls the otherwise sharp texture, but the closure image remains vivid and intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements—an arsonist-conservator, erased indigenous civilization, artistic breadcrumb trail, and a love story encoded in textiles and portraiture—feels fresh and conceptually coherent. The idea of burning falsifying texts as a counter-archive tactic is a striking, non-obvious angle. That said, some larger-frame moves (evil corporate/government cover-up, data dump to journalists) lean on familiar genre patterns, tempering the overall sense of radical novelty.</comment>
