<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Matthias is specific and compelling—a spent revolutionary turned elegist-scholar—with a clear throughline from past revolt to present devotion. His motives (vindicating the erased builders, atoning for a failed revolution) are legible and consistent, and his choices (staying, working alone, writing in verse) align. Internal contradiction (fervor vs exhaustion, scholar vs revolutionary) is present but more implied than actively dramatized in on-page dilemmas. The ending’s stance—continuing as an elegist rather than rejoining any collective fight—reads as an earned, quiet renunciation, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The structure is clean: a single scene framed by an approaching and passing temporal storm, with backstory woven in and a clear before/after in Matthias’s understanding and resolve. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: storm → mirror-checking → shard vision → recognition of the builders’ sophistication → renewed commitment to his project. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the final overlap of reflections reweights his revolution and scholarship in light of the aliens’ own temporal knowledge. The dispute and larger world are mostly offstage, but enough is dramatized here to avoid feeling like pure exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid and temporal storms are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action and meaning: the décor, mirrors, carved stone panels, and auroral time-streams all shape what Matthias can do and know. Environmental rules (storms, mirror feedback, shard remembering light) are consistent and drive his tactics (covering mirrors, waiting out storms, using the shard). The setting mirrors his internal state—ornate, emptied, haunted—and the final image of shard at mirror depends on this environment’s specific properties. Worldbuilding feels both lush and economical, with no white-room moments and no gratuitous cataloguing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake is epistemic and memorial—whether the lost civilization will be acknowledged as non-human and remembered—and the secondary stake is Matthias’s sense of purpose after a failed revolution. Pressure accumulates via the storm, the risk of the mirrors, and the ideological conflict with Keraine, but the latter remains abstract and untested in scene. The main tightening is his realization that the aliens also knew and mitigated temporal storms, which deepens the cost of their erasure and cements his quiet vow to keep asking. The conflict is intentionally low-key and internal; effective for a lyric piece, but it never quite bites into a hard on-page tradeoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of historical erasure, the ethics of colonization, the afterlife of revolutions, and our need to build beauty against time emerge organically from the particulars of the asteroid, the shard, and Matthias’s trajectory. Recurring images (mirrors, covering/uncovering, cathedrals from sorrow) gain weight by the end without feeling like forced symbols. A few lines veer close to thesis statement (“The academic dispute was really about this—…”) but remain grounded enough in his perspective to avoid sermonizing. The final insight about shared sorrow at our reflections feels earned and lingers conceptually rather than as a tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent with a former revolutionary turned scholar-poet: elevated but not implausibly so. Diction, syntax, and metaphor choices feel deliberate and patterned to his sensibility, giving the narration a distinct perceptual signature. The modulation around the storm and at the reflective ending is smooth, with no POV leakage or unexplained stance shifts. Even without dialogue, the piece maintains intimacy and momentum through controlled internal narration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is lyrical yet generally disciplined: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, characterization) without obvious redundancy, and rhythm varies well. Metaphors like “built their halls like prayers” and “shard… remembered light” are vivid and coherent, with few if any mixed or strained images. A couple of lines come close to purple or explanatory (“What remained was this: him, the asteroid…”) but they still do work and don’t stall momentum. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic glitches to undercut clarity, especially in the closing beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of visible time, baroque alien architecture, temporal archaeology, and a washed-up revolutionary’s poetic practice feels fresh and thoughtfully imagined. The “temporal storms + mirrors + memory-shard” system is a distinctive way to literalize history and perception, and the revolution-to-tenure-war arc gives a sharp, non-obvious social angle. Key turns (recognizing the aliens’ own precautions, reinterpreting his revolution as a tool for remembrance) arise from prior premises rather than a late twist. The story takes aesthetic and conceptual risks in a way that reads cohesive rather than gimmicky.</comment>
