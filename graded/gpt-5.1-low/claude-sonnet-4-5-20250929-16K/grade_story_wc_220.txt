<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Finder is sharply sketched: the veteran tracker whose body-memory of landscapes and corpses now grates against her desire for quiet, and this contradiction motivates her choice to leave safety for Crow. Her professional habits (reading grooves by touch, scanning objects) double as emotional tells, which grounds her competence in character. Crow is thinner but still specific enough—older, grayer, voice rough—to register as a real history partner rather than a device. The main limitation is that her internal conflict on the journey itself is summarized (“her old skills returning”) rather than dramatized under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal line is clean: cylinder arrives → riddle decoded via the wax leaf → coordinates discovered → journey → reunion → decision to “find the living.” The structure holds to a clear before/after—retirement in isolation vs recommitting to connection—with no orientation issues and a legible lens of causal progression. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the same skills used for finding the dead are now re-aimed, with an implied cost in reopening wartime wounds and leaving her settled life. The main structural softness is that the three-day journey is elided so cleanly it never quite tightens stakes on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The scrapyard settlement, cracked wasteland, and satellite-bone village are vivid, economical, and seen through a tracker’s eyes, giving the world a tactile, lived-in feel. The preserved wax leaves function as micro-setting objects that directly constrain choice (map revelation) and also charge the final image. Environmental details like wind through corrugated walls and the “fallen dish antenna” shelter support the lonely, post-war hush without turning into cataloguing. The only reason this doesn’t reach the very top band is that the wasteland journey, while mentioned, doesn’t materially shape tactics beyond a brief montage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Finder will remain entombed in her post-war isolation or risk reconnecting with Crow—is clear and thematically apt. There is one meaningful tightening when she recognizes Crow’s voice and the encoded coordinates, which narrows her options from passive listening to a committed journey. However, the middle of the story (the three-day crossing and potential dangers of the wasteland or emotional relapse) is largely summarized, so pressure feels smooth rather than mounting. The reunion and choice to “find the living” resolve the conflict convincingly but without a strongly felt price in-scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Distance vs connection, and the retooling of death-reading into hope-reading, emerge organically from Crow’s riddles, the phonograph’s secret texts, and the wax leaves’ “tinted revelations.” The recurring idea of reading hidden inscriptions in matter (landscapes, grooves, veins) gives the theme a satisfying concrete grammar. That said, the final paragraphs edge into explicit thesis statements—“connection was still possible,” “Some distances were meant to be crossed”—that slightly undercut the otherwise embodied resonance. A touch more reliance on image and less on spelled-out insight would move this into truly elite territory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The third-person close voice is consistent, with nice textural choices like “twisted metal bones” and “wild hush” that feel tied to Finder’s sensibility rather than generic SF diction. Prose modulates gently between lyric description and functional narration, and the dialogue is lean, believable, and subtextual enough to carry history without exposition dumps. Phrases like “intuitively descriptive in every gesture” and “tinted revelations” risk slight self-consciousness, but they still fit the story’s aesthetic. POV boundaries are clean, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentence-level craft is controlled and rhythmic, with good variation and minimal scaffolding; nearly every line adds either world texture or emotional charge. Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to muddy clarity, and repeated motifs (distance, bones, wild hush) are deliberate rather than accidental loops. There are minor moments of conceptual redundancy in the closing statements about connection, but they don’t significantly blunt the final image. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the piece reads aloud smoothly without algorithmic cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The fusion of post-resource-war wasteland, a retired body-tracker called Finder, phonograph cylinders as riddle-bearers, and wax-preserved leaves that reveal maps via light is a fresh synthesis. The central emotional move—two specialists in finding the dead reorienting their craft toward finding the living—feels specific rather than template. While the broad arc of “traumatized veteran risks connection again” is familiar, it’s executed through idiosyncratic tools and images that would not easily transpose to another setting. It stops short of truly radical innovation but is solidly distinctive and coherent.</comment>
