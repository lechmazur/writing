<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya’s sensibility is specific and convincing—she’s the kind of person who notices “creeping normality,” and that curiosity motivates her entry and interpretation of the house. Her backstory with her grandmother’s perfume shop grounds her recognition of the orris root and feels organically tied to her skills. However, internal conflict and cost are light: her shift is more graceful realization than hard-won, contradictory struggle. The final decision to help the house remember is earned but emotionally low-risk, which keeps the characterization shy of top-tier depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The structure is clean: evening walk → unsettlingly animate house → discovery of systematic displacement → orris-root placement and revelation → conceptual reframe and new intention. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, and the closure—a conceptual repricing from “creeping normality” to “creeping memory”—lands clearly. There is a felt before/after in how Maya understands the house and her role. The main limitation is that the stakes and cost of this closure remain gentle, so the structural turn, while elegant, doesn’t fully bite.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting work is vivid and purposeful: the quiet bay, hammered-silver water, lilac-and-salt air, and the Ashford house’s interior all feel tactiley inhabited. Details like “pale rectangles in the paint” on the sill and the migration of cups and plates are specific and integrated into action. Environment and object-as-setting (the house, the orris shard) clearly charge the final understanding, even if they don’t strongly constrain physical options. This is near-elite atmosphere, held back only by the fact that the world doesn’t significantly limit or redirect tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The central stake is largely conceptual: Maya’s desire to understand the house’s aliveness and the meaning of the displacements. There is some escalation (from eerie observations to entering the house to decoding the pattern and intervening), but little real pressure or opposition; nothing seriously resists her or makes her choice costly. The story reads more as a contemplative revelation than a conflict that tightens and forecloses options. As a result, while the piece is satisfying, the pressure curve is relatively flat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of memory, place, and the “grammar” of objects in houses emerge strongly through the pattern of displacements and Maya’s history with scent and craft. The final reframing from haunting to a house “working…to become themselves again” has genuine resonance. However, the story repeatedly states its ideas in thesis-like form (“Houses feel alive when they remember,” “Some silences aren’t empty”), which drifts toward moralizing rather than trusting image and implication. This explicitness blunts what could be a subtler, more haunting thematic aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature: metaphors are sensuous and tied to Maya’s sensibility (“streetlights daydreamed,” “shards of hush,” “hushed blaze”). Psychic distance is handled smoothly, and the narration never knows more than Maya can infer. The prose modulates well between description and interiority without head-hopping or register breaks. It stops short of the very highest band only because, at times, the voice leans into essayistic abstraction instead of trusting scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, varied in rhythm, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is mostly precise and evocative, and the story maintains momentum without getting bogged down in exposition. There is a slight tendency toward over-articulated abstraction in key thematic sentences, but it doesn’t obscure sense or closure. Overall, the prose feels polished and publication-ready with only minor tightening of overt statements.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The idea of a “haunted” house as a structure painstakingly restoring its original arrangement to remember itself—via “shards of hush” and displaced objects—is fresh and memorable. The integration of perfumery, orris root’s three-year curing, and the house’s abandonment timeline is particularly deft and non-generic. The conceptual twist from haunting to self-sanctification reads as inevitable in hindsight given the seeded details. Its one limiter is that the final explanatory paragraphs edge toward essay, slightly reducing the strangeness and allowing the conceptual framework to feel explained rather than entirely discovered.</comment>
