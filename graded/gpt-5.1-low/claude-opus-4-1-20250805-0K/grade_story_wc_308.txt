<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Yula’s motivations and long arc from restless mover to disciplined still-point are clear and character-specific, rooted in reverence for history and a desire to innovate. Her endurance across centuries carries a credible cost that’s legible in the dust, the bone towers, and the final exchange with her younger voice. Internal contradiction (revering the past while attempting something unprecedented) is present but mostly stated rather than dramatized in live, conflicting impulses. More embodied emotional texture under peak beats would push this toward top-tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: present-tense stillness anchored on the tower, with controlled expansions into history and skill-building, all returning to the present when the wandering pulse resolves as her own voice. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise moment—“I am still here”—with the centuries of self-imposed immobility as felt cost. Causality within this mode is consistent, though the middle concentrates more on exposition of capability than on a live turn. A slightly sharper mid-scene inflection of pressure would make the structural arc even more compelling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and integral: bone towers, the canyon of endless echoes, and the acoustic “library” of death songs all directly underpin the premise of time navigation through sound. Environmental rules (echoes as moments, bones as archives) are consistent and used to shape Yula’s method and limitations. The recurring arrowhead and layered dust function as micro-setting details that charge the final image with deep time. Description occasionally leans lush, but it remains purposeful and anchored to Yula’s perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Yula can truly navigate time without moving and meaningfully reconnect with what she set in motion—is conceptually strong but only softly pressured on the page. Escalation appears mainly through intensifying pattern (vultures → synchronization → swallows/message) rather than through concrete narrowing of options or visible jeopardy. The final return of her own voice delivers a satisfying tightening, yet the path there feels relatively unopposed and serene. A clearer sense of risk, failure modes, or internal resistance in the present would deepen the tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of stillness versus movement, reverence for history, and the idea that the truest journeys may be interior arise organically from the images and Yula’s long vigil. The canyon as an acoustic archive and the returning younger voice nicely embody how actions reverberate across time. Lines like “the greatest journey was the one that required no steps at all” veer toward explicit thesis but are supported enough by the preceding particulars to avoid feeling didactic. More dramatized friction around the cost of that philosophy would add further complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The third-person voice is lyrically confident, with a distinct texture (“bone towers,” “marrow and memory,” “canyon’s endless conversation with itself”) that feels unified with Yula’s contemplative, long-time perspective. Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing both mythic scale and intimate focus without head-hopping. Diction and rhythm stay consistent and purposeful, especially in the closing cadence. The voice occasionally risks over-elevated abstraction, but it remains legible and character-appropriate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prose is generally tight and evocative, with high information density—most sentences carry worldbuilding, mood, and character in tandem. Metaphors are original and thematically aligned, and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. A few phrases (“wound in the earth,” “marrow and memory”) edge toward familiar lyric registers, but they don’t create confusion or drag. Rhythm and sentence variation support a measured, meditative momentum that suits the piece.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of stone-skimming, acoustic time navigation, bone towers, and bird-flock notation feels strikingly original and coherently developed. The device of a centuries-delayed echo of one’s own arrival statement reconfiguring the premise at the end is both conceptually neat and emotionally resonant. The story commits fully to its weird physics and reverent tone without flinching into explanation or genre cliché. Some thematic elements (stillness as journey) are familiar, but the execution through this specific world and method is fresh.</comment>
