<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mari’s liminal status as “administrative ghost” is sharply motivated and consistent, and her choice to embrace the mistaken death certificate feels psychologically grounded. Her sensory focus on memory-texture and small bureaucratic artifacts individualizes her interiority. However, we see relatively little active contradiction in her impulses in the present; she’s already chosen dissolution before the scene begins, so on-page struggle is muted. The final act of signing names is earned but could land with more visible emotional cost if her attachment to any prior identity were tested more directly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The accumulative structure—daily walks, discovery of Container 47-B, recognition of a pattern, and spring-tide revelation—builds coherently to a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive plot twist. Causality is clean: overheard dock talk → investigation of the container → recognition of other “administrative ghosts” → joining the congregation. Closure is clear and on-page: signing the names and leaving with the label as “compass” reframes her existence under a new communal logic with conceptual cost. The structure remains mostly linear and legible, though the pressure of each step could be tightened by foregrounding what she risks losing if she doesn’t find belonging.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The port’s container labyrinth is vivid and sensorial—rust, dawn light, echo-navigation, and tide levels all feel tangible and lived-in. Environment meaningfully constrains choice (low tide for eavesdropping, high tide for private reading; spring tide as climax), and Container 47-B is a specific, charged micro-setting. The final image of groaning metal harmonizing with “testimonies of the nameless” beautifully fuses place and theme. A small push toward how the physical precarity (e.g., flooding, instability) might bodily endanger her could heighten the already strong atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The primary stake—whether Mari remains merely dissolved or claims a new form of existence among the erased—is clear but largely internal and conceptual. Escalation arrives through pattern-recognition (realizing others like her have been here) and the spring-tide annotation that demands testimony, forcing her to choose to sign. This deepening works under an accumulative lens, but the on-page sense of risk or sacrifice in that choice is relatively gentle. The piece could reach a higher band if her decision visibly foreclosed an alternative (e.g., returning to the world of the living) rather than mainly affirming a path she’s already on.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of bureaucratic erasure, the materiality of memory, and unofficial testimony emerge organically through particulars: the mislabeled prescription, container marginalia, and Mari’s pocketed label. The idea that “truth could be compressed into such small, lethal fragments” recurs in subtle variants and is reweighted at the end with the signatures and the rust, avoiding didactic summary. The explicit line “We who don’t exist must testify to each other's presence” edges toward thesis-statement, but it’s plausibly in-character and is dramatized by Mari’s subsequent act rather than left as abstract commentary. Overall, the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer about how erased people persist through each other’s records.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The third-person-limited voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly keyed to Mari’s sensibility, with a distinct attentional bias toward textures, documents, and echoes. Syntax and diction are controlled and varied, supporting the contemplative but quietly tense mood. The occasional quasi-philosophical line (“administrative ghosts, filing errors, the officially erased who could perceive reality's thin spots”) still feels rooted in Mari’s worldview rather than authorial intrusion. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the modulation from observational to more charged at the spring tide reads intentional and smooth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is dense but precise, with many sentences doing double duty (worldbuilding and theme, or image and emotion) without slipping into purple or muddled metaphor. Rhythm varies well between longer, flowing descriptions and shorter, more declarative insights, keeping momentum in a reflective piece. Repetition is purposeful (tides, containers, annotations) rather than looping or scaffolding, and there are no significant line-level artifacts or clarity drops. A few formulations could be pared slightly for sharper impact, but overall the line craft is publication-ready.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of bureaucratic death, “administrative ghosts,” and a shifting container maze as a gathering place for the officially erased feels fresh and non-obvious. Using memory as a tactile filter and a misprinted label as both relic and compass gives the piece distinctive texture. The idea of layered marginalia in a forgotten container as a clandestine archive of dissolved identities is inventive and thematically tight. It stops just short of transformational brilliance only because the emotional and ethical stakes of joining this archive could be pushed even further into unsettling territory.</comment>
