<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara’s grief, devotion, and growing willingness to release Thomas are clearly motivated and embodied (“her voice breaking with screaming tenderness”), and her months-long work to purify her intentions gives her final choice weight. Internal contradiction—loving him yet needing to free him from protecting her—registers, though it could be sharpened further in on-page micro-choices. Thomas is more essence than person, but his guilt and protective love are legible enough for this length. The final merger feels earned, though the emotional transition from imprisoned guilt to re-emergence is almost too smooth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: heat wave → thinned reality → discovery of Thomas’s state → months of intentional work → dawn ritual with the vial → his partial return. The dominant drive is causal with an accumulative lyrical layer, and closure is a clear Decisive Change: Thomas crosses from in-between to embodied presence, redefining their options. Stakes remain focused and contained—emotional rather than large-scale—but are consistently honored. The cost of three years’ vigil and his altered, not-fully-human state is on the page and gives the ending bite.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse, dawn light, and sea are vivid and specific, and the beam itself becomes functionally important when it “caught something impossible” and helps solidify Thomas. The night-jasmine scent as an impossible environmental intrusion is an effective micro-setting device linking inner state and world rules. Weather (heat wave breaking) and sea conditions are more atmospheric than constraining, but the isolation and vertical architecture (spiral stairs to lamp room) plausibly shape her actions. Description is selective and purposeful, rarely veering into mere postcard detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The core stake—can Mara free Thomas (and herself) from a prison of guilt-bound love—is signaled early and followed through. Escalation comes mainly from her deliberate shift in tactic: from desperate vigil to purified, forgiving intention channeled through the jasmine ritual and direct confrontation. However, once she articulates forgiveness, his movement toward embodiment encounters little resistance, so the climax feels more like a graceful unlocking than a test under real pressure. The cost is present but mostly retrospective, not newly extracted in the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme centers on how love, intention, and forgiveness can both imprison and liberate, with the lighthouse and jasmine functioning as recurring images that shift meaning at the end. The idea that “love could purify intentions until they became tangible” is powerful but occasionally stated too baldly, edging toward thesis. The resolution—“Not to save me, but to be saved”—nicely crystallizes a reorientation of love from self-sacrifice to mutual redemption. Complexity is present but somewhat cushioned; the piece edges close to sentimentality without quite tipping over.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with distinctive turns of phrase (“bruise healing into gold,” “screaming tenderness”) that feel of a piece with Mara’s heightened emotional state. POV is stable and interior access consistent; the narrative doesn’t leak into authorial summary beyond what suits a slightly elevated literary register. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying emotional charge and moving the scene forward rather than explaining. At times the narration leans toward abstract explanation of the metaphysics, but it largely stays anchored in concrete perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong, with varied syntax, clear sequencing, and high information density; most sentences do at least two jobs (image + emotion, or world rule + theme). Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and sensorially grounded, though phrases like “garden of sensation” and “gentle violence of refusing to let go” skirt purple. There are no evident paraphrase loops or scaffolding remnants, and rhythm modulates effectively toward the climax. The prose’s lushness is a feature here, but a touch of restraint in key lines would sharpen impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise—lighthouse, lost lover, spectral return—is familiar, but it gains freshness from the metaphysics of “vibrations of intent” manifesting memory into molecules and the focus on purified intention as a disciplined practice. The jasmine vial as a carrier of intention and the notion of love-as-prison versus love-as-release add specific inflections. Still, many moves (isolated keeper, townspeople think her mad, dawn reunion) track established ghost-romance patterns. The story feels well-executed more than radically new, with a few memorable conceptual twists.</comment>
