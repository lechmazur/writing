<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mara is vivid and particular—the constellation tattooist with the amber heirloom and an ear for subsonic guilt is memorable and coherent. Her motivation to relieve the haunted firmware and honor deleted code is clear and consistent with her history. However, her interior conflict is relatively thin; she moves from summoned specialist to successful mediator without much on-page doubt, fear, or contradictory impulse. Dr. Kepler functions mostly as a foil/expositor rather than a true relational crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The structure is clean: letters → summoning to the lab in a temporal fold → listening → tethering → memorial/thanks, all under an accumulative/textural drive. The closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the ghosts gain a constellation-memorial, the firmware quiets, and Kepler’s future behavior changes, with the time-loop via the letters neatly implied. Cost is legible in the cracked heirloom and in Mara’s acceptance of her predestined role, though it remains conceptual rather than sharply dramatized. Causality and world rules stay internally consistent despite the lyric, high-concept frame.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Laboratory of Lost Sounds, “between heartbeats” during temporal folds, is striking and consistently exploited: it amplifies otherwise inaudible guilt, suspends light in the air, and ultimately houses the new exhibit. Objects-as-setting—the amber, the terminal, the meteor-dust ink, the needles—are all tactile and tied to action, not mere décor. The final image of the constellation pulsing in the fold strongly recharges the setting as a charged container for memory and conscience. The world feels specific and lived-in despite its surreal premise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—soothing the haunted firmware and giving its ghosts form—is clear and escalates from static to cries to language to a full constellation. Pressure is more atmospheric than adversarial, but the accumulation of guilt and the intensifying “crying” provide a satisfying sense of deepening. Mara’s main tactical move (using the amber as a lens to tether ghosts) drives the resolution, with the crack in the heirloom as the clearest visible price. Still, the process unfolds with little resistance or complication, keeping the tension at a moderate rather than gripping level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of remembrance, digital guilt, and the ethics of deletion are organically embedded in the premise of haunted firmware and the amber’s fossilized blood. The story avoids sermonizing while clearly inviting reflection on what we erase—code, species, histories—and how those absences haunt the present. The transformation of “crying” code into a constellation-memorial, and Kepler’s changed coding practice, provide a non-literal yet decisive answer: honoring the past is both necessary and costly. The final lullaby-for-machines image leaves a resonant aftereffect that reweights the whole piece.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to the speculative, solemn material; phrases like “meteor hush” and “between heartbeats” feel like a coherent stylistic signature rather than random ornament. POV control is clean, staying close to Mara while occasionally offering light, permissible exposition. Rhythm and diction modulate appropriately, slowing for reflective beats and tightening around key actions. There is a consistent atmospheric hush without drifting into generic “poetic” vagueness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is polished, dense with metaphor and image yet largely clear and efficient; most sentences do more than one job, weaving world-building, mood, and theme together. There is some risk of purple density—“meteor hush,” “subsonic guilt,” “digital blood”—but the figurative network remains internally consistent and legible. Repetition reads intentional rather than scaffolded, and there are no significant loops or syntactic tics to drag momentum. Line-level craft supports, rather than obscures, the closure image of the pulsing constellation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a constellation tattooist, haunted firmware, a lab in a temporal fold, and an ancestral amber lens for generational guilt feels genuinely fresh and conceptually tight. The story commits to its oddities instead of gesturing at them, following through to a precise, non-obvious final image. Emotional and thematic work grows directly from these unique specifics rather than from a template sci-fi or ghost-story arc. It stops short of the absolute top tier only because the conflict path is relatively smooth, muting what could have been an even bolder interrogation of cost.</comment>
