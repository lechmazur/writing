<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara is sharply sketched—a specialist with a specific vocation, history, and ethical drive—and her sensory focus (sound, pulses) feels character-rooted. Motivation (protecting vulnerable voices) is clear and consistent. However, she rarely experiences contradictory impulses or visible inner conflict under pressure, so her heroism feels declared more than wrestled with. The change at the end is more situational (she’s located the source) than an earned internal turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: strange pulses → investigation in the atrium → photograph anomalies → decoded birthday song → realization of memory theft → location of culprit → run toward confrontation. As a short, one-night case file, the structure suits the length and the closure image of mist lifting and hearts speaking lands as a clear RR. The major weakness is that the crucial revelation (“Someone… had been harvesting memories”) is summarized rather than dramatized, feeling a bit like an explanatory leap. Still, the drive lens remains coherent and the ending has a legible before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The mist-clad glass atrium, trembling orchids, amber light, and “copper on her tongue” create a rich, coherent atmosphere filtered through an audiologist’s sensibility. Setting details are selective and thematically aligned with liminality, silence, and intrusion. The environment mostly supports tone rather than constraining choices; Mara could plausibly do similar work in another charged locale. Even so, the atrium and mist strongly shape the story’s sensory identity and are well integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The central stakes—seventeen stolen consciousnesses and a spreading Silence—are vivid and quickly legible. Pressure escalates from eerie anomaly to active erasure (faces fading) to the ethical horror of harvested last words, culminating in Mara’s decision to run toward the hoarded voices. However, Mara faces little resistance or trade-off; the path to the “basement of Willowbrook” is almost frictionless once the system speaks. The conflict is conceptually strong but feels one step short of a truly testing cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of exploitation of the vulnerable, the ethics of listening, and grief as contagion arise organically from the job, setting, and antagonistic method of “harvesting memories.” The notion of incidental heroism—born from “persistently curious about the sounds others couldn't hear”—is thematically apt and partly dramatized. There is mild over-articulation in the closing sentence spelling out heroism’s incidental nature, but it stops short of sermonizing. The final image of mist lifting and hearts remembering how to speak offers a resonant, non-literal answer without feeling pat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is lyrically inclined yet coherent, with distinctive metaphors like “breath through broken teeth” and “telegraph of terror” giving the piece a strong sonic and textural identity. POV is steady and plausibly bounded by Mara’s perceptions and professional biases. At times the diction flirts with purple, but rhythm and control generally prevent it from tipping into muddle. The modulation between eerie quiet and urgent pursuit is handled smoothly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line-by-line, the prose is polished, with good syntactic variety and high information density—many sentences carry character, world, and mood simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but not chaotic; the metaphors mostly cohere around sound, bodies, and transmission. There is slight stacking (“reeling hush of forgetting,” “cathedral of suspended gold”) that leans ornamental rather than necessary, but it rarely stalls momentum or clouds meaning. No significant loops, scaffolding, or clarity errors impede the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The blend of epidemiological language (“contact tracer”), emotional contagion, and a retro-tech hearing aid tuned to the dead is unusually fresh and feels organic rather than gimmicky. Harvesting last words as a kind of psychic theft gives the mystery a morally specific angle that suits the protagonist’s vocation. “Incidental heroism” grounded in professional curiosity is a nuanced twist on the savior trope. While some beats (a secret basement of stolen voices) echo genre conventions, the synthesis and execution are distinctly memorable.</comment>
