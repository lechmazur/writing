<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Marina’s vocation, history with wrecks, and sensitivity to ghosts create a coherent, motivated protagonist whose choices (diving, bringing the globe, transcribing, accepting the broader quest) feel earned. Interiority is specific enough to avoid generic heroism, especially in the line about every wreck being “practice for this moment.” However, there’s limited on-page contradiction or genuine internal struggle; she moves quite smoothly from recognition to acceptance of her role. The chemist-ghost is effective but more functional symbol than fully pressured secondary character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal chain is clear: wreck → globe → shrine → visions → formula → larger quest, with no real orientation or logic gaps. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Charged Poise: Marina leaves with the antidote and a map-like mandate to seek twelve more globes. The main weakness is that obstacles are minimal and the problem-solving feels almost effortlessly linear, so cost is conceptual more than viscerally felt. Still, for this length, the structure is clean and the before/after is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The glacier shrine, candles, ice walls, and frost-face manifestations are vivid and tightly integrated into action: candles melt ice, reveal ghosts, and determine how the globe’s pattern can be read. The environment charges the final image, with the ceiling constellations mapping future wrecks and “borrowed starlight” echoing the opening. Setting is filtered through Marina’s professional and psychic lens rather than as inert scenery. A minor limit is that non-visual senses are lightly used, though the visual motif is strong enough to carry the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—retrieving and decoding the antidote formula and recognizing the broader mission—is clear and escalates as the ghosts’ purpose is unveiled. However, conflict is largely one-sided revelation; Marina encounters little resistance, risk, or dilemma beyond the implied weight of responsibility. The Cassandra’s self-scuttling and the off-page biological weapon raise abstract stakes more than scene-level pressure. As a result, the story feels high-concept and purposeful but not especially tense.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of salvaging purity from wreckage, seeing “windows where others saw walls,” and the dead repurposing dreams are woven coherently through objects and images (globe, candles, constellations). The final paragraphs crystallize Marina as a “salvage artist of impossible things,” which reweights her entire career in a thematically satisfying way. Some lines verge on explicit thesis (“The ghosts had chosen their messenger well…”), softening complexity into affirmation. Nonetheless, the piece leaves a resonant sense of responsibility, connection, and redemption without collapsing entirely into moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is stable, with a clear lyrical texture (“borrowed starlight,” “windows of connection”) that feels consistent with Marina’s unusual vocation. Expository passages (about the weapon and refugees) remain within a controlled narrative stance and don’t break POV logic. Rhythm and diction are mostly well judged, modulating between concrete description and more elevated metaphor without jarring shifts. It stops short of an utterly distinctive, unforgettable idiolect, but is confidently handled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, with most doing double duty for atmosphere and plot. Figurative language (“caught candlelight like borrowed starlight”) is vivid and generally coherent with the story’s imagery system. There is some risk of purple prose and thematic restatement in the closing stretch, but it doesn’t significantly blunt momentum or clarity. No noticeable scaffolding, loops, or syntactic monotony interfere with the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of Arctic wreck-diving, ghost-mediated dream cameos, a melted snow globe encoding an antidote, and a glacier shrine that maps future salvages feels genuinely fresh and conceptually committed. The premise doesn’t rely on a single twist; it builds a coherent micro-mythology about how the dead communicate and entrust knowledge. The “twelve more globes” expansion is a classic series-launch move but here reads as thematically and logically grounded rather than gimmicky. This combination of ghost story, ecological/cosmic imagery, and near-apocalyptic biotech stakes would stand out in a competitive slush.</comment>
