<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s guilt, professionalism, and attraction to uncertainty are clear and consistent, and her interiority around the mistaken coordinates feels specific rather than generic. The grandfather/pen connection nicely individualizes her relationship to the anomaly. However, her peak-choice moment reads a bit too calm and conceptually tidy for the scale of the moral cost, with limited embodied stress or messy contradiction on the page. The emotional aftermath of choosing to transmit both coordinate sets could be deepened to feel fully commensurate with the stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Orientation is clean and the causal chain—past misinterpretation → study of anomaly → realization it edits reality → rescue ship decision—is coherent and legible. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: the act of sending both coordinate sets reframes reality choice rather than resolving it neatly. The cost of this “both realities” move, however, is somewhat under-articulated; implications for the rescue outcome are largely elided into abstraction. The structure holds under a mostly causal/Conceptual lens, but an extra beat of concrete consequence would elevate it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The station, observation chamber, and especially the gravitational anomaly are described with selective, purposeful detail that supports both atmosphere and concept. The anomaly’s behavior (bending/filtration of light, observer-specific displays) is consistently applied and integral to the rules of the world. The dried fountain pen works as a micro-setting object that charges the final image and anchors her timeline. A slightly broader use of non-visual sensory grounding in the chamber could further heighten immersion, but what’s here is already strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—thirty thousand lives versus the discovery that reality can be edited—is clear and potent, and the approach of the rescue ship provides a natural tightening. Internal and external conflicts interweave effectively: her guilt and desire for knowledge directly inform the choice at the end. However, most of the pressure is handled in reflective exposition rather than dramatized struggle, and the final act of sending both coordinates feels like a conceptual workaround rather than a sharply agonized trade-off. The stakes are high but not fully felt viscerally at the decisive moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Themes of uncertainty, subjective reality, and the ethics of “editing history” arise organically from the anomaly’s behavior and Mira’s profession, with the pen and “wrong seeds” serving as coherent motifs. The final conceptual shift—that multiple edited realities may be equally true and that “wrong seeds” can yield unexpected gardens—fits the narrative pattern. Yet the last sentence tips into aphoristic moralizing, stating the lesson rather than fully trusting the images and situation. A more oblique closing image or silence around the “garden” idea would deepen resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, with a measured, science-poetic lexicon that suits Mira’s role and worldview. Explanatory passages about the anomaly’s mechanics and contingent relationships stay within a plausible register for a technical yet reflective protagonist. Rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony, and the narrative distance remains stable. Occasionally, exposition edges toward essayistic, but it doesn’t break POV or clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is generally clean, vivid, and efficient: “bent starlight into impossible spirals” and “editing history” as a cosmic editor are strong, memorable formulations. Information density is good, with most sentences carrying both conceptual and emotional weight without obvious redundancy or scaffolding. A few phrases lean abstract (“thresh meaning from experience,” “contingent relationships”) but mostly remain anchored in imagery. There are no serious loops or overwrought metaphor clusters that impede clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The central conceit of a gravitational anomaly as a personalized cosmic editor of history, scaled via contingent relationships and observer effect, feels fresh and thoughtfully explored. Tying this to a concrete professional error (misrouted colonists) keeps the premise from becoming mere thought-experiment. The “send both coordinates” resolution is an interesting, non-obvious move that aligns with the confidently-uncertain theme, even if its consequences are under-detailed. Overall, the synthesis of hard-ish SF, metaphysics, and moral stakes is distinctive and memorable.</comment>
