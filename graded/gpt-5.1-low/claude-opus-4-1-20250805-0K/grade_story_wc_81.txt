<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation (to verify truth during the rare quiet) is clear and consistently expressed through her methods and priorities. Her competence is well-drawn—bone-conducting earpiece, sensitivity to resonance—but internal contradiction or emotional cost is underplayed, keeping her arc fairly flat. The choice to descend during a blackout and stop when interference returns feels credible and aligned with her character. What’s missing at this tier is a sharper sense of personal risk, doubt, or inner conflict that would complicate her dedication to the work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The structure is clean: a single continuous descent-and-work sequence under time pressure, with each step logically following from the last (blackout → descent → detection → marking → generators reactivating → withdrawal). The inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: we gather detail and stakes as the pattern of forgery emerges and time runs out. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she cannot finish but has “marked enough,” accepting a partial, ongoing victory with conceptual cost. No major causality breaks or orientation issues, though the turns are more quietly procedural than sharply dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The underwater library and phosphorescent algae are vividly and economically rendered, and they directly shape tactics: blackout and water silence the hum, algae light reveals ink, preservation fields scramble frequencies. The setting is not postcard dressing but an active constraint and resource, especially in the blackout/generator/EM interference cycle. The final image of algae guarding “honest ink” powerfully recharges earlier environmental details. This is strong enough to sit just below the very top band, where even more idiosyncratic or surprising environmental turns under peak pressure would be needed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving an accurate record before the blackout ends—is clearly signaled and coherently maintained. Escalation comes from the ticking clock of power restoration and the discovery that the forgeries are more surgically targeted than expected (specific pages, critical treaties). However, most obstacles are mastered without real failure or hard trade-offs; there’s little sense that she might have to sacrifice something personal or abandon a crucial volume. The cost is mostly opportunity and incompleteness, which is conceptually resonant but not strongly dramatized as a painful choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of corporate manipulation of history, analog vs digital preservation, and the ethics of patient guardianship emerge naturally from action rather than commentary. The idea that truth survives in quiet, analog patches beneath an electrified, forgetful surface world is well embodied by the algae/stamp/library triad. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the work is ongoing, partial, and dependent on those who listen in the margins of systems. It stops short of more complex moral friction (e.g., personal complicity or ambivalence about tampering with “official” history), which would push it higher.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is stable, measured, and suited to Mira’s meticulous, almost meditative work. Diction is controlled and occasionally lyrical without losing clarity, and the narrative does not head-hop or break its stance. There’s a distinct perceptual signature in how she attends to frequencies, vibrations, and procedural detail. The voice could be even more individuated—more surprising turns of phrase or idiosyncratic thought patterns—before entering the highest tier.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is generally tight, vivid, and purposeful, with strong information density: most sentences do double duty in worldbuilding and advancing action. Rhythm is varied and readable, and there is no major scaffolding or synonym-looping that drags momentum. A few phrases and constructions verge on the gently purple (“dappled resolve,” “reclaimed stillness”), but they remain coherent and on-theme rather than muddling sense. Line-level craft is publication-ready, if not yet dazzling enough for top-band scores.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The fusion of an underwater municipal archive, algae-based verification methods, and corporate historical forgery feels fresh and thoughtfully integrated. The choice to center a quiet, technical task (page indexing) under pressure, rather than an overtly heroic mission, gives the piece a distinctive texture. The analog-vs-digital and blackout-as-opportunity angles are not wholly unprecedented but are handled with specificity that makes this feel like its own vision. A bolder risk in either narrative structure or emotional calculus could push this into the mid-9 range.</comment>
