<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Maya’s characterization as the honest child of a con artist is sharply rendered and drives every choice, from her clinical professionalism to her insistence on full restitution. Her internal conflict (love vs. moral revulsion) is present but more conceptual than embodied, which slightly mutes peak moments. Wei is sketched efficiently with a credible shift from inherited rage to destabilized confusion, though his complexity lags behind hers. The final “subtraction” of sins from love feels earned by prior setup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: Wei breaches because of the theft, confronts Maya, and her prepared offer of restitution and ashes reconfigures the situation. The scene is continuous, well-oriented, and the envelope plus ink-pot request culminate in an Earned Stasis closure where Maya chooses to bury what remains of her father. Costs are legible (relinquishing inheritance, accepting knowledge of her father’s crimes), though escalation is more intellectual than perilous and Wei’s de-escalation feels somewhat swift. Still, the before/after is clear and satisfying at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prep room is vivid and specific—fluorescent light, “chemical-sweet” air, tools, and embalming procedures are integrated into action rather than set-dressing. The setting’s macabre, clinical atmosphere underpins the theme that death is the one place deception fails. It doesn’t tightly constrain tactics beyond keeping Maya at the table, but the way she works on the body while negotiating charges the imagery at the end. The ink pot as a charged micro-setting element amplifies the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The central stake—how to reckon with the father’s crimes in front of a wronged heir—is strong and signaled early. Pressure coherently rises from potential confrontation/theft to a complicated moral negotiation involving money, ashes, and symbolic restitution. However, Wei’s rage liquefies into cooperation with little resistance or concrete threat, so the external conflict feels resolved slightly too smoothly. Internal and moral stakes carry the load effectively, but a sharper on-page test of either character’s limits would deepen the sense of cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Thematic through-lines—mathematics of cons vs. fair trade, honesty as a form of accounting, and death as un-con-able truth—are tightly woven into plot, setting, and object. The ashes-as-ink idea is a powerful image of embodied atonement that reweights the entire backstory. Some lines verge on explicit thesis (“The mathematics of a fair trade isn’t about equal exchange”), edging toward didactic, but they’re grounded enough in character logic to mostly avoid sermonizing. The final calculation of love vs. sins offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The close third-person voice through Maya is consistent and suited to the blend of technical detail and moral calculus. Prose occasionally slips into aphoristic generalization (“Death couldn’t be conned”) that feels slightly more authorial than character-bound, but it aligns reasonably with her reflective temperament. Dialogue is clear and goal-driven, though some of Maya’s explanatory blocks read more like composed monologue than spontaneous speech under stress. Overall, the narrative texture is distinct, controlled, and coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is clean and purposeful, with strong images like “deathly vitality” and the ink pot “heavier now with truth” doing thematic and atmospheric work simultaneously. Sentence rhythm varies well, and there’s little scaffold or redundancy; most lines advance more than one layer (plot, character, or theme). The repeated math metaphor nudges toward over-insistence but stops short of feeling gimmicky. No significant figurative muddle or syntactic clutter interferes with clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The combination of con-artist legacy, funeral-home craft, political asylum, and ashes used as apology-ink feels fresh and conceptually unified. The “mathematics of a fair trade” lens on emotional and ethical debt is a distinctive inflection on familiar generational-reckoning stories. Structural choices are conventional but executed at a high level; risk lies mostly in the boldness of the central symbolic conceit, which pays off. It doesn’t quite break new formal ground, but the synthesis of elements is memorable and specific.</comment>
