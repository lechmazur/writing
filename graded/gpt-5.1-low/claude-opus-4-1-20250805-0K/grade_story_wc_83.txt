<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Amira’s motivation is specific and compelling, rooted in concrete loss and an almost scientific mysticism about “unused potential,” and her tactics (studying perturbation theory, exploiting the cooling window) align cleanly with that drive. The grief is felt through objects and choices more than labels, which works well. However, her inner life is largely unconflicted—there’s little sense of moral hesitation or self-doubt about unleashing this discovery—so the final stance comes a bit too smoothly. Dr. Chen functions credibly as a foil, but remains thin and largely agreeable under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The causal chain is clear: Amira engineers an opportunity, uses the scanner, discovers the pooled potential, and reacts by transmitting the data before security arrives. The cooling-cycle clock, the alarm, and the security breach all tighten the scene without confusion, and the observatory-elevation rule is paid off at the discovery beat. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the world’s physics and moral economy are reweighted by the revelation that severed futures can be returned. The main limitation is that institutional and personal consequences are mostly projected, not yet partially felt, which softens the sense of immediate cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The floating observatory, the quantum scanner, and the view of scarred Earth provide a specific, tonally apt environment that clearly links altitude to the thinning boundary between realities. The geode functions as a micro-setting object, grounding both grief and cosmological stakes and charging the final image. Environmental detail is selectively used rather than lush, but almost always purposeful (e.g., the blown breakers and cooling cycle as enabling constraint). A bit more tactile, embodied engagement with the lab and zero/low-gravity environment could deepen atmosphere further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The central stakes—whether Amira can locate and reclaim severed futures before the institution suppresses the discovery—are clear and tighten via the time limit, the anomalous readings, and the early end to the cooling cycle. Her agency drives the main turns: bringing the geode, overriding the scanner, and choosing to scatter the data rather than secure it. However, the opposition (security, “they’ll destroy this research”) stays largely abstract and never lands a concrete hit, so the risk feels asserted more than viscerally borne. The release of vast forces occurs with very little on-page downside or ethical friction, which mutes the sense of price at the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Themes of grief, restitution, and the ethics of harnessing versus returning stolen potential are organically embedded in the geode, the wedding rubble, and Amira’s refusal to “harness” the energy. The conceptual move from energy conservation to moral accounting (“Physics demanded it”) is sharp and memorable. Some lines edge toward thesis-statement territory—especially Amira’s explicit correction of Chen and the final “remembered how to hope” tag—which flattens subtext into articulation. Still, the closing vision of tomorrow’s dreams finding new dreamers carries genuine resonance beyond the literal plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The close third on Amira is mostly steady and credible, with a cool, technical lexicon that fits her self-taught scientific obsession and the lab context. Dialogue is functional and clear, if occasionally a bit declarative (“These are consciousness patterns, but they’re not degrading.”), and the few lines of Chen’s speech are distinct enough in role if not in strong idiom. Narrative voice slips very mildly into omniscient or essayistic assertions at times, but not enough to break focalization. The voice is competent and smooth rather than strikingly individual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentences are generally clean, well-paced, and information-dense; most lines do more than one job, moving plot while layering concept or emotion (“not with light but with possibility itself”). Repetition of key abstractions (“unused potential,” “pools,” “future”) feels intentional rather than like synonym churn, and there are few, if any, true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is controlled and usually apt, without purple drift or mixed metaphors muddying meaning. The prose stops short of exceptional distinctiveness, but it’s publish-ready at the sentence level.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The central conceit—violent death leaving quantized pools of unrealized futures that can be located and potentially re-routed—is a fresh and emotionally resonant fusion of quantum language with trauma. The geode as a literal and metaphorical recorder of a wedding’s annihilated possibilities is a strong, specific instantiation. While some genre echoes exist (scientific ghost fields, trauma as energy), the particular configuration of floating observatory, perturbation theory, and ethical “return” versus exploitation feels distinct. The story could push further into unexpected moral or tactical complications to reach the very top originality band.</comment>
