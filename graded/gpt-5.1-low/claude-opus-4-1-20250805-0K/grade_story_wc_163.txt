<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira is clear, specific, and plausibly motivated; her discipline and temperament shape how the story unfolds (observation and pattern rather than intervention). However, she faces little real internal contradiction or pressure, so we rarely see competing impulses in action. The relationship with Chen is lightly sketched but functional, with a subtle status contrast between instrument-driven and intuition-driven approaches. Her final realization is emotionally credible but comes at low visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The structure is clean: feather → descent to dome → luminous event → contemplative closure, all anchored in a single continuous window with a small temporal reach-back. Causality is soft but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens; the alignment explanation, the city's response, and Mira's interpretive role all interlock. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Mira redefines her aim from solving to inhabiting mystery—with the city's darkening functioning as a clear cadence. Stakes remain largely contemplative rather than pressured, which keeps this out of the very top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The underwater research station and drowned city are richly and specifically realized—glass dome, bacterial light, impossible minerals, bioluminescent creatures—and always filtered through Mira’s professional gaze. Setting is not just backdrop; the star-correlated coral geometries and the observation dome literally define what the characters can perceive and understand. The burnt feather and the glowing city together charge the final image of “shadowseam wonder,” satisfying the object-as-setting and environment-charging-closure tests. A slight bias toward the visual is the only minor limitation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake is existential/intellectual: understanding and belonging to the city’s cosmic rhythm. Pressure deepens somewhat as the luminous respite unfolds and Mira hunts for a non-instrumental meaning, but there is no credible threat, loss, or hard choice testing her values. The main “turn” is a realization rather than a decision under duress, and Chen’s presence does not substantially intensify conflict. The result feels beautifully textured but low-tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of belonging, humility before the cosmic/ancient, and inhabiting rather than mastering mystery are coherently developed through concrete particulars: coral matching galactic arms, ritual wings, fish moving like constellations. The luminous respite and the feather both reweight from curiosities to bridges across time, tying theme to image. However, lines like “some mysteries weren't meant to be solved but inhabited” edge toward explicit thesis-statement, slightly flattening subtext. Overall, resonance is genuine and earned but not fully understated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The close third-person on Mira is stable, with a confident, lyrical narrative voice that suits both her profession and the speculative setting. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and sentences vary pleasantly in length and structure. Dialogue is sparse but natural, clearly distinguishing Chen’s pragmatic fatigue from Mira’s more numinous orientation. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the perceptual filter feels consistently hers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is vivid and generally economical, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“stone breathed and coral grew in perfect spirals that matched galactic arms”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly clean and coherent; it rarely descends into muddle or cliché. There are a few spots of mild purple or abstraction in the final paragraph, but they do not significantly blunt the closure image. Information flows clearly, without noticeable loops or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of “landscape astrologer,” star-responsive coral architecture, and a drowned city dreaming in response to celestial cycles feels fresh and committed to its own logic. Details like ceremonial wings that once burned to trigger luminous periods, and fish schooling as constellations, give the premise distinctive texture. The arc—a scientist-mystic shifting from analysis to participatory wonder—is not wholly new, but it’s handled with specificity and without genre-template crutches. Slightly higher risk in conflict or structural experimentation would be needed to push it into the exceptional range.</comment>
