<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kira’s motive (find mother, decode shard, understand the withheld truth) is clear and consistently enacted, and her profession as a sensory map maker meaningfully shapes how she perceives and chooses. The mother-daughter relationship pays off with a credible emotional beat, but internal conflict (guilt over damage vs hunger to map) stays mostly implied rather than dramatized in specific contradictory impulses. The mother herself functions more as a mouthpiece for exposition than as a fully realized, pressured character. The final shift—“We don’t stop mapping. We map the repairs.”—is motivated but arrives a bit too fluently, without much on-page struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: shard arrives → Kira uses it to cross → worlds escalate in weirdness → nexus → confrontation and reframe of their role → new mission. The drive reads Hybrid (causal progression with an accumulative sensory pattern), and closure is a Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing—mapping becomes healing instead of damage, with a clear before/after. However, several crucial beats (the universe’s unraveling, the mother’s long work, the mechanics of “patching”) are summarized rather than dramatized, softening the sense of earned cost. The resolution feels a touch neat for the stakes invoked (infinite universes dying), even though it lands emotionally.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The spaceport repair bay and its alternates (fungal, sideways gravity, underwater, pristine with drones) are vivid, specific, and filtered through Kira’s synesthetic sensibility in a way that feels character-particular. The recurring environment of the bay as “repair” site nicely mirrors and then reconfigures the thematic arc when it becomes a place of cosmic restoration. World rules about parallel universes are consistent enough for this length and mostly conveyed through sensory transformation rather than dry exposition. The setting shapes meaning more than tactical options, but it does charge the final image of the bay as “what it had always been meant to be.”</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The stakes (find mother; understand and mitigate the universe-destroying cost of their work) are strong and signaled early via the shard’s cyclical appearances. Escalation is present through increasingly strange versions of the bay and the violent redirect into the nexus; pressure coheres as Kira is pulled toward a specific confrontation. However, resistance and cost are lightly sketched—Kira never seriously considers refusing the shard’s pull, and the ethical/moral dilemma (keep mapping vs stop harming worlds) is resolved rapidly by a clever reframe with little on-page price. The universe-scale danger is mostly conceptual rather than felt in a concrete, narrowing choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of discovery vs damage, inheritance of a dangerous gift, and truths withheld out of love are well-embedded in the shard’s recurrence, the mother’s exile, and the final choice to “map the repairs.” The revaluation of mapping work (from exploratory hubris to reparative responsibility) reads as a genuine Conceptual Repricing. Some phrasing edges toward explicit moralizing (“some truths are withheld not from cruelty but from love”), which flattens nuance slightly. Still, the closing image of two map makers binding worlds together carries real emotional and conceptual resonance beyond the literal plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is confident, with a distinct sensory texture (“rust became the taste of copper bells, engine grease transformed into violet whispers”) that feels integrated with Kira’s vocation and perception rather than decorative. Psychic distance is well managed, pulling closer in key beats (use of the shard, seeing the mother) without head-hopping or unexplained jumps. Explanatory passages about quantum unraveling and “microscopic tears” flirt with expository flatness but remain within a plausible register for this SF mode and do not break voice coherence. Dialogue is sparse but natural enough for two highly technical, exhausted characters under high stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line by line, the prose is polished and mostly tight, with varied sentence rhythms and strong, concrete images; the synesthetic translations are inventive without becoming incoherent. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and nearly every sentence adds either world texture or forward motion. A few formulations (“cyclically throughout her life,” “unraveling at the quantum level”) feel more generic/scientific than the surrounding lyricism, slightly diluting intensity. Overall, though, momentum holds and the final paragraphs land clearly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The fusion of sensory cartography, synesthetic navigation, and multiverse repair work is a fresh spin on parallel-world SF, and the idea that explorers themselves are fraying reality is a strong ethical twist. The green shard as recurring object, life-stage marker, and eventual sacrificial tool adds a mythic texture that feels particular rather than templated. The core emotional arc—a child seeking a vanished parent—leans on familiar patterns, and the reparative turn (“we map the repairs”) is clever but not wholly surprising once the cost is revealed. Still, the synthesis of concept, vocation, and theme feels distinct enough to be memorable.</comment>
