<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marina’s motivation (finding a new way to guide ships) is clear, consistent, and plausibly rooted in her history with her grandfather and the lighthouse. Her competence with charts and polishing gives her texture, but we see little genuine internal contradiction or strain once the magic appears. Emotional beats tend toward earnestness rather than complexity, especially in the teaching sequence. Tomás functions mainly as a prompt for exposition rather than a true source of pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: lighthouse failure → repeated grotto visits → revelation of glass’s power → public demonstration → communal adoption. Structure is straightforward two-shard (grotto discovery / harbor demonstration and evening teaching) with a clear before/after. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus mild Resonant Reconfiguration (solitary keeper → shared guidance), but the transition is smooth to the point of near-ease, with little friction or cost. No orientation or lens issues, but the resolution feels slightly too painless for the setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto, mist, and harbor are vividly rendered and integrated with action: the stillness, acoustics, and amphitheater mouth all matter to how the light works and how it’s shared. Professional bias shows in Marina’s attention to light behavior, lenses, and angles. The recurring sea-glass and grotto setting tangibly charge the final image of communal instruction. A touch less lyric ornamentation in early description would better match the modest on-page pressure, but the spatial and sensory grounding are strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—ships needing guidance through fog—is signaled early and paid off when the boats visibly change course in response to Marina’s beacon. However, once the glass glows, there is almost no resistance or complication; the external problem is solved on first attempt, and the villagers’ acceptance is immediate. Internal conflict (fear of failure, grief, doubt) is implied but never really tests her resolve in scene. As a result, escalation feels more like a graceful unfolding than a pressured narrowing of options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Images of stars, light, and polishing accumulate toward a coherent theme about finding and sharing softer, patient forms of guidance. The final paragraph crystallizes this but also tips into explicit moralizing (“light could be shared without flame, that guidance could emerge from patience and polish rather than power and heat”), undercutting subtext. The “pearl of stillness” idea is thematically apt but lands mostly as a named thesis rather than a discovered tension with real cost. Emotional aftereffect is gentle and pleasant more than deeply unsettling or complex.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, with a clear perceptual signature focused on light, surfaces, and maritime detail. Lyric phrasing (“liquid starlight,” “zephyr bloom of dawn”) is generally controlled and suits Marina’s contemplative stance. Dialogue is sparse but natural and functional, avoiding exposition dumps and staying in character. There are no POV slips or register breaks, though the voice flirts with sentimentality in the closing reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; most sentences carry atmosphere and character simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and legible, with only occasional strain (“zephyr bloom of dawn”) and no mixed-metaphor confusion. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and syntax stays clear even in more descriptive runs. A slight tendency toward purple in low-pressure moments keeps it just below top-tier line work.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The blend of maritime realism with a quasi-magical, communally shareable sea-glass lighthouse feels fresh and well tailored to Marina’s background. The specific mechanics—polishing as activation, mist as canvas, grotto as amplifier—show thoughtful integration rather than generic fantasy trappings. However, the emotional arc (grief → revelation → communal healing) is familiar and resolved without a non-obvious twist or hard-earned ambiguity. Strong, appealing, but not yet at the level of “only this story could exist in exactly this way.”</comment>
