<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vera’s professional rigor, temptation to feel “something genuine,” and adherence to her rule against consuming merchandise create a clear, specific psyche. Interiority is concrete and filtered through her craft (e.g., parsing emotions into “protective” vs “letting-go”). The internal conflict—dealer vs would-be user—is present but never pressured into a truly costly decision; refusal feels more like reaffirming the status quo than a wrenching renunciation. Still, she reads as distinct and non-generic, with a believable constellation of motives.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The structure is clean: one continuous scene from dusk through the grotto’s brief permeability window to its sealing and her exit. Causality is straightforward (grotto transforms → harvesting intensifies → time runs out → temptation arises → she recommits to her rule and leaves). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the final stance that curated half-emotions are “merciful lies” reweights everything that came before. The cost and stakes of breaking her rule are only implied, not dramatized, which keeps the arc from feeling fully decisive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The amber grotto at dusk is vivid and sensorial, with consistent rules (permeability window, absorbed confessions) that directly shape action. Details like static crackle, carved steps, and “liquid gold” walls feel particular to Vera’s perception and profession. The environment constrains choices via the narrow dusk window and supplies the raw material for her work, rather than serving as a mere backdrop. A touch more interaction between her body and space under pressure could push it higher, but it’s already richly functional.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake is Vera’s choice between exploiting/consuming the half-truths herself and maintaining her disciplined role as dealer of curated emotions. Pressure escalates via the strengthening static, the grotto’s tightening transformation window, and the increasingly “yearning” emotions. Her refusal to subsume the feelings is an earned stasis rather than a radical pivot, and the psychic price of perpetual emotional abstinence is sketched more than sharpened. The tension is real but remains quiet, never quite forcing an acute sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Thematically, the piece explores whether edited, incomplete emotions can be kinder and “truer” than full honesty, with half-truths framed as mercies in a too-sharp world. This emerges organically from Vera’s practice and the widower’s request, not only from exposition. However, the final paragraph edges into thesis-stating (“sometimes the kindest thing…”) instead of trusting the accumulated images to carry the weight. The richness of the underlying idea compensates for a hint of over-articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The third-person close voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Vera’s sensibility as a professional emotion-dealer and scent worker. Lexicon and rhythm (“affectionate detachment,” “joy preserved in amber, authentic but mercifully incomplete”) feel deliberate rather than generic. There’s a controlled, slightly elevated register consistent with speculative literary work, without intrusive authorial commentary. At times the narration explains a touch more than necessary, but POV distance and texture remain coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The prose is polished, with strong images, good rhythm, and efficient integration of worldbuilding into sentence-level texture. Occasional repetitions (“The transformation was beginning now…” / “The transformation was nearly complete now…”) and explanatory lines in the final paragraph slightly blunt momentum. A few abstractions (“professionally thorough,” “deeper patterns”) could be grounded more concretely at peak beats. Overall, density and clarity are high, with only minor drift toward exposition and faint purple notes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The fusion of a perfume-testing tool, static-electric emotion harvesting, and an amber grotto that releases half-truths at dusk is strikingly fresh. The notion of selling curated, incomplete emotions as a service, and positioning half-truths as “merciful lies,” offers a non-obvious twist on both magic systems and grief management. Everything coheres around that conceptual spine rather than feeling like a grab bag of quirks. With slightly sharper on-page cost, this would be in near-immediate-publish territory for originality.</comment>
