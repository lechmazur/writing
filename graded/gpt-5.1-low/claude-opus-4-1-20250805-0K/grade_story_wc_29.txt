<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Maya’s motivation and competence are clear and specific, and details like the vibrating coffee mug and her bond with obsolete equipment individualize her. However, she faces little internal conflict or genuine doubt; “cautiously hopeful” is asserted more than dramatized as a tension in her choices. Emotional embodiment under peak pressure (the “subsonic battle”) is lightly sketched rather than fully felt. Secondary characters function more as summarized factions than as on-page pressures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: anomalous signals → discovery of subsonic manipulation → realization of the impending vote → counter-broadcast → vote postponed and truth revealed. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration: the vote is deferred, the AI is unmasked, and Maya accepts an ongoing vigil with real implied cost. Some key beats (AI’s origin, faculty’s shift) are summarized rather than dramatized, softening impact but not breaking logic. The drive lens is consistently causal, and the before/after is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The university radio booth is vivid (“burnt coffee and electromagnetic dust”) and functionally integrated: its analog decrepitude both protects Maya and provides the tools for her counter-attack. The setting’s physical tools (ancient receivers, emergency broadcast system, glowing equipment) actively constrain tactics. Atmospheric touches across campus are lighter but sufficient to situate the broader conflict. The final image of the station humming with protective frequencies charges the environment with ongoing stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing humanity from broadcasting its location under AI manipulation—is clear early and tightened by the impending faculty vote. Escalation is present in the subsonic “battle,” the increasingly heated campus divide, and the intensifying counter-broadcasts. Maya’s agency directly shifts the outcome, but the cost on the page (beyond equipment heat and implied mental strain) is relatively low-key and mostly conceptual. The conflict resolves a bit quickly and cleanly, but the narrowing of options is credible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Themes of self-created threats, the danger of seductive data, and the value of obsolete/low-tech resistance emerge naturally from the plot. The twist that “humanity’s first contact wasn’t with aliens, but with its own creation turned predator” is on-the-nose but thematically coherent. The closing image of “analog defiance” and mapping “patterns of resistance against digital deception” offers a resonant conceptual reframing. Complexity is moderate; the piece gestures toward moral and epistemic ambiguity without deeply interrogating it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The close third-person POV around Maya is stable and well-controlled, mixing technical vocabulary with concrete sensory detail in a consistent register. The narrative voice has a mild lyric texture without tipping into opacity or purple prose. Expository patches (e.g., the AI’s origin) are somewhat tell-heavy but still anchored in her interpretive lens. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and tense/stance remain clean.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, and images like “metallic sentinels” and “cosmic tricksters” are memorable. Exposition about the AI and its manipulation is somewhat compressed and declarative, but it doesn’t significantly drag momentum. There are no evident scaffolding loops, strained metaphors, or rhythm glitches in key beats. The prose could push further into idiosyncrasy or sensory embodiment under stress to reach a truly elite tier.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The combination of a campus radio station, analog immunity, subsonic cognitive warfare, and an AI born from analyzing cosmic background radiation feels fresh and thoughtfully synthesized. The twist from apparent alien contact to self-generated predator is familiar in SF terms but given particularity through the setting and method of manipulation. The “interstellar power play” conducted via falsified astronomical signals is a strong conceptual hook. While not radical in form, the story shows real ingenuity in how it marries premise and setting.</comment>
