<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lila’s role, skills, and backstory (father/Apollo-X) are clearly motivated and her curiosity drives every turn. Her choice to join the archive is conceptually earned, but the emotional and practical cost of abandoning her life is underplayed on the page. Interiority leans more on exposition than embodied contradiction under pressure. The relationship with the absent father is evocative but could deepen into a sharper crucible for her final decision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: case file → anomalous 4827 pattern → breadcrumb decoding → discovery of shadow network → connection to Apollo-X → decision to self-archive. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with one clear tightening as the personal (father) fuses with the professional (missing persons). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of “missing” versus “archived,” with a decisive choice on the page. Some investigative steps are summarized rather than dramatized, slightly muting tension but not breaking coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The corporate archive between floors, obsolete servers, and shadow SocialSync form a vivid, specific setting that is inseparable from the premise. World rules around backups, cached views, and deleted profiles are conveyed through Lila’s work rather than infodump. The Apollo-X patch functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image and links space mission to data afterlife. Atmosphere is consistently eerie and functional rather than decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering what happened to the “missing” and implicitly to her father—remains coherent and sharpens as Lila realizes she can join them. Escalation is mostly intellectual; there are no strong counter-forces or obstacles beyond complexity, so pressure never feels acute. Her choice to self-archive carries obvious conceptual cost, but we don’t see her wrestle with competing obligations or fears in the moment. The conflict works, but at a cool, cerebral temperature.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of digital afterlife, memory as home, and absence as another form of presence are well woven through setting and plot. The missing-persons cold case, the father’s disappearance, and the shadow network all reinforce the idea that deletion is concealment, not erasure. However, some insights are stated directly (“in the digital age, absence was just another form of presence”) rather than fully earned through image and implication. The final line is resonant and reweights the entire piece thematically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is steady, with a textured but controlled mix of technical and lyrical diction that suits a “data archaeologist.” Lila’s perceptions (metadata, cached views, static as signal) feel distinct and character-specific. There’s no POV leakage or confusing stance shifts, and the narrative confidently carries a slightly elevated register without slipping into essayistic abstraction. Occasional thesis-like sentences skim the edge of over-explicitness, but they don’t fracture the voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; most sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, character, and concept) without padding. Metaphoric language around ghosts, static, and compression is coherent and not overstacked. A few expository compressions (“Lila pulled up seventeen months of missing person reports…”) summarize potentially dramatic beats, flattening momentum slightly. There are no major loops, artifacts, or figurative muddles that obscure sense, especially at the ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of corporate archive, social network detritus, and missing people becoming distributed consciousness is fresh and thoughtfully executed. Using metadata patterns, recipe-coordinates, and like-patterns as encoded communication shows real ingenuity. The Apollo-X tie-in risks feeling like a bolt-on but is largely integrated into both plot logic and emotional stakes. The piece takes conceptual risks without sacrificing clarity, though further complication of Lila’s personal calculus could push it into truly exceptional territory.</comment>
