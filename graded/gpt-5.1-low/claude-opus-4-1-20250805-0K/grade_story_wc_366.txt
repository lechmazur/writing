<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elsa’s characterization is clear, specific, and rooted in her long habit of solitude; her reticence and comfort with silence credibly motivate why the ghosts choose her. Her major choice—to accept the role and tend the light—is earned by prior details about her bond with Jonas and the stone language. Internal contradiction (her fear vs. her competence in isolation) is present but lightly sketched rather than deeply dramatized in-scene. Jonas and the other keepers function more as thematic pressures than as fully realized individuals, which is appropriate but limits relational complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal chain is strong: extinguished lamp → letter-triggered arrival → stone message → climb → ghostly revelation → choice to rekindle the light. The piece lands a clear Decisive Change: Elsa becomes the new keeper and restores the lamp through intention, with an implied cost of lifelong service and solitude. The exposition about “every keeper” writing letters is a bit on-the-nose but doesn’t break logic or momentum. Closure feels satisfying and legible within a single continuous scene plus brief prior context.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse, rocky shore, phosphorescent foam, and lantern room are vividly evoked and tightly bound to Elsa’s professional gaze. The environment constrains action (climbing the spiral, the dead lamp, the gallery deck) and the recurring sea glass object charges both the turning-on of the lamp and the final emotional register. Atmosphere (“the stairs seemed to breathe,” “dead eye a wound”) consistently reinforces the haunted, melancholic mood without becoming cluttered. Spatial and sensory choreography remain clear despite the supernatural overlay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stakes—whether Elsa will take on the burden of guarding both ships and lonely ghosts—are coherent and present by the midpoint. Pressure escalates from eerie absence of light to direct confrontation with Jonas’s ghost and the collective need of the dead, culminating in her decision and re-igniting the lamp. The cost of her choice (lifelong isolation, responsibility) is more implied than sharply dramatized, which softens the bite of the climax. Still, the internal and external conflicts braid effectively for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of loneliness vs. chosen solitude, guardianship, and “bottling” safety emerge organically from the stone language, sea glass, and lighthouse work. The final image—stones spelling “You are not alone” read by weeping ghosts—has genuine emotional resonance. However, several sentences state the theme directly (“These weren’t weaknesses but gifts,” “The lighthouse had chosen someone…”) in ways that edge toward moralizing rather than trusting subtext. The piece is moving but slightly too eager to explain its own meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The close third-person POV on Elsa is steady and confident, with her perception guiding which maritime and atmospheric details matter. Prose rhythm modulates well between quiet, descriptive passages and the more charged revelation in the lantern room, without head-hopping or stance confusion. Dialogue is spare but functional, distinguishing Jonas’s resigned warmth from Elsa’s tentative speech. The narrative voice has a consistent, slightly lyrical texture that suits the material.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, varied in length, and efficient, with most images doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Metaphors like “dead eye a wound in the star-scattered sky” and “stairs seemed to breathe” are vivid without crowding the page. There are no noticeable repetition loops or scaffolding sentences; information density is high and momentum steady. A few theme-forward lines could be trimmed for maximal sharpness, but they don’t materially dull the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Haunted lighthouses and lonely keepers are familiar, but the stone-stacking language and sea-glass-as-bottled-safety give this version a distinct texture. The twist that the anonymous letters are written by generations of dead keepers is conceptually neat and integrates well with the emotional arc. The story doesn’t radically subvert genre expectations, but it commits to its premise with coherence and specific, memorable images. Its ingenuity lies more in a carefully executed synthesis than in structural or conceptual risk-taking.</comment>
