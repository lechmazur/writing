<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira’s motives (understanding the orchard, countering the remodel, using her last months) are clear and consistent, and her acceptance of death as “an appointment” is a strong, character-specific turn. However, internal contradiction (terror vs duty, resentment vs awe) remains mostly implied rather than sharply dramatized in scene. Emotions are often embedded in the conceptual frame rather than in concrete bodily experience, which slightly blunts impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: diagnosis → diary → three weeks of work → copper network completion → realization of the caretaker’s true role → plan for trustees. Closure works as a conceptual repricing: dying becomes a specialized function, and the temple shifts from building to living council, with a clear cost (her imminent death and lifelong pattern of caretakers). The structure is mostly a single, continuous scene interwoven with reflection, and the “trustees arriving tomorrow” adds a modest, if mostly anticipatory, external clock.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The temple orchard, volcanic stone pillars, and copper wiring are vivid, specific, and integrated into action (wrapping branches, the humming pillars, the final glow under her palm). Setting is not backdrop but mechanism: the fused stone-root architecture enables the interspecies council and constrains how communication must occur. The final image—her hand on the pillar, feeling “ancient patience” through the copper network—directly charges the environment with thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stakes—how Mira will use her six months and whether the living architecture will be recognized rather than remodeled into a resort—are clearly signaled. Escalation is primarily through deepening understanding (completing the network, learning the caretakers’ fatal pattern) rather than active opposition, so pressure remains contemplative rather than sharply conflictual. The trustees and human resistance are off-page, which softens on-page tension even as it sets up a meaningful future confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme is strong and coherent: interspecies respect, perception as architectural frequency, and death refigured as translational labor. The integration of tumor-as-frequency with the living temple yields a memorable, non-obvious reframing. However, the closing paragraphs lean into explicit thesis (“The temple didn't need renovation. It needed recognition…”) instead of trusting the accumulated images, which nudges the tone toward essayistic sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent and confident, with a distinct lyrical-scientific texture (“architectural frequencies only the dying could perceive,” “geological memories of previous extinctions”). POV boundaries are clean, and the narrative distance holds steady, allowing both mythic register and concrete technical detail. Occasionally the register tilts toward expository abstraction, but it largely serves the character and premise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is fluent, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; images like “salt spray on a windless day” and “die at the correct frequency” are striking without becoming incoherent. Figurative language is frequent but generally controlled and thematically unified around frequencies, minerals, and growth. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and syntax supports momentum from setup to final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of brain tumor as essential translator, copper-wired arboreal architecture, and a temple as interspecies council is fresh and memorable. The idea that caretakers are chosen by a fatal electromagnetic signature and “die into translation” is a particularly strong, non-obvious twist. While it echoes some solarpunk/eco-mystical tendencies, the specific mechanics and charged diary device make this feel distinctive.</comment>
