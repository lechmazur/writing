<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s reticence and warmth are embodied through micro-choices—brushing stone stacks, pocketing sea glass—that reveal his values without exposition. Harlan’s coughing frailty and coded notes deepen motivation credibly. The final act of rebuilding the stack earns his shift from observer to protector with visible cost: he breaks silence, accepts burden. However, Harlan’s emotional arc leans slightly on summary (“found solace in replying”) rather than dramatized contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias’s vow to protect the chain crystallizes options amid encroaching haunt and failing light. Cost is legible—the lamp is dead, Harlan is dying, safety must now be carried, not housed. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via stacked stones, layered notes, sea glass, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. One flaw: the transition from lantern room descent to dawn departure is slightly blurred (“Alone? With Harlan?”), but not enough to break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—fog, cracked panes, iron grating, and spectral whispers pressure every action. Pebbles, sea glass, and Fresnel lens are tactile anchors that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective (wet cough, cool glass, wavering lantern pools) and filtered through Elias’s professional gaze. The environment doesn’t just mirror mood—it enables the stone-message system that drives the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving “safety’s glow”—tightens when the lamp fails, forcing Elias from passive ferryman to active guardian. His agency drives escalation: reading notes, choosing to reply, rebuilding the stack taller. Cost is felt—the haunt presses closer, Harlan’s rattle deepens, dawn arrives alone. Coincidence never resolves; all pressure stems from the lamp’s death and the keeper’s decline, coherently escalating under an Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: safety as fragile, transferable light, preserved through anonymous acts of witness. The sea glass and stone stacks reweight from curiosities to vessels of resilience. Final line (“his protection a silent vow in the luminescent ache of safety preserved”) offers non-literal answer—safety endures not in structures but in relayed gestures. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers (Will the chain survive? Can silence carry warmth?), yet resonance is undeniable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-limited through Elias, with perceptual signature: he notices pebble tilts, callused fingers, warmth in nods. Voice modulates under pressure—shorter sentences during haunt’s approach, lyrical cadence at closure. No head-hopping; Harlan’s interiority is inferred through action and rasped dialogue. Prose rhythm mirrors sea and silence: rolling clauses for observation, staccato for threat. Elision (e.g., skipping descent details) is purposeful, paid off by dawn’s gleam.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative (“waves clawed,” “luminescent ache,” “shadows twisted like grasping fingers”), but one paraphrase loop weakens momentum: “No—that exceeded; trim in mind, but wait, counts build. / Harlan watched, eyes softening. Wait, recount precisely later.” These meta-comments read as drafting artifacts, briefly obscuring cause/effect. Otherwise, high information density, varied syntax, and concrete verbs (“hauled,” “pried,” “shoved off”) sustain propulsion. Closure image remains sharp despite minor mid-text clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse tropes through specificity: stone-stacking as maritime semaphore, sea glass as bottled memory, the letter chain as anti-ghost ritual. The “luminescent ache” tone feels fresh—melancholy without gothic excess. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative revelation via found notes) heightens thematic stakes. Not derivative; emotional truth grounds the conceit. One near-miss: “drowned souls etched into glass” flirts with cliché but is redeemed by the pragmatic, human counterpoint of fisherman signals.</comment>
