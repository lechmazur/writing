<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—to salvage purity from wreckage—is embodied through tactile interaction with the snow globe and reinforced by micro-choices that reveal her ethical rigor (“never yanking spirits... but coaxing them thread by thread”). Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead expressing guilt, reverence, and resolve through sensory perception and action. The final renunciation of vengeance in favor of truth-weaving earns an Earned Stasis with visible cost: ghosts freed, betrayal exposed, but no personal gain beyond the locket. Flaws are present (her obsession borders on recklessness) yet never safety-hedged.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara refuses to condemn, instead weaving truth to free souls, foreclosing vengeance at the cost of personal closure. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—dream cameos layer into a unified vision—and the shrine’s ice, candles, and borrowed starlight consistently anchor time/place by line 30. Cost is legible in the child’s locket salvaged and the ghosts’ sighs fading “like starlight at dawn.” No causality breaks; every cameo feeds the final exposure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The glacier shrine isn’t backdrop—it constrains tactics (candlelight refracted through ice prisms enables vision) and charges the ending (the reformed globe seals “windows of connection” as purity endures in borrowed starlight). Sensory detail is selective: breath fogging like starlight, viscous pool shimmering like quartz veins, candle drips echoing silence. Every environmental element reflects or contrasts Elara’s emotional state without overt symbolism. The snow globe itself functions as micro-setting, evolving from melted artifact to truth vessel.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—salvaging purity amid betrayal—is signaled early and deepens through cameo analysis that narrows options: only by cross-threading visions can truth coalesce. Elara’s agency drives escalation; she chooses not to force spirits but to listen, enabling the mate’s exposure. Cost is unmistakable: the child’s spirit haunts dreams, the captain’s guilt flickers in nightmares, and the final act requires binding a snarling ghost. Pressure tightens once, decisively, under an Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: purity survives not through innocence preserved but through truth carefully woven amid corruption. The locket’s twin gleam—untouched by malice—offers a non-literal answer to whether anything good endures after betrayal. No moralizing; resonance builds via recurring images (starlight, ice, threads) that reweight meaning at closure. Ambiguity lingers—the first mate’s fate unresolved—but the cost of deceit versus the endurance of love is clear.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled single-third, with a perceptual signature that filters everything through Elara’s wreck-diver sensibility (“callused fingers,” “barnacle-crusted hatches”). Syntax modulates under pressure: short clauses during ritual invocation, lyrical flow in vision sequences. Diction remains within her plausible lexicon—no register drift—even amid elevated imagery. Elision is purposeful (ghosts’ origins summarized efficiently), and the voice never converges or flattens; every sentence feels character-embodied.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines: “breath fogging the air like borrowed starlight” establishes setting, mood, and motif in one stroke. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally with paragraph cuts mirroring ritual beats. Figurative language is coherent (ice as vow, dreams as cameos) and never muddled in peak moments. Minor overwriting in “viscous pool... veins of quartz” slightly dilutes propulsion, but clarity at closure remains pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fusion of maritime ghost story, forensic dream analysis, and glacial mysticism—all grounded in Elara’s specific vocation. Tropes (haunted ship, whisperer) are transformed by the method (cameos in strangers’ dreams) and stakes (purity as salvageable artifact). The risk of lyric abstraction pays off: “borrowed starlight” isn’t mood but mechanics. Every element feels irreplaceable; swapping any core component would fracture the story’s delicate causal weave.</comment>
