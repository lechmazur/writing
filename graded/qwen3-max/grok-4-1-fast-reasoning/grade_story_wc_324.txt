<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—protecting vulnerable voices—is embodied through micro-choices (e.g., overriding caution to use the hearing aid) and consistent with her “persistently curious” trait. Clara’s arc feels credible, though slightly underdeveloped due to limited interaction time. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are conveyed through tactile responses (“fingers brushing the glass,” “sobs muffled in the reeling hush”). The final renunciation—Clara choosing life—is earned by Evelyn’s mediated plea, not external manipulation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Clara’s shift from surrender to endurance carries visible emotional cost and forecloses suicide. The drive lens is Causal—each beat links via “because/therefore” (e.g., because Elara inserts the aid, she hears Evelyn; because she relays the message, Clara reframes her grief). Orientation is immediate (“Twilight draped the mist-clad atrium…”), and the single-scene structure adheres to scope defaults. Cost is legible in Clara’s tears and Elara’s spent pulses.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium functions as micro-setting that pressures choice: its liminal twilight enables ghostly contact, while spatial choreography (bench, balustrade, railing) guides movement and stakes. The hearing aid and photograph act as environmental constraints—their physical states (tarnished, frayed) charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective (“dew,” “brass casing,” “static crackled”) and filtered through Elara’s professional curiosity. Weather and architecture evolve with emotional beats, never static.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preventing Clara’s suicide—is signaled early via her hollow eyes and railing grip. Pressure tightens when Elara activates the hearing aid, narrowing options: intervene or let history repeat. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (Elara’s curiosity compels her to speak), and cost is unmistakable—Clara’s raw sobs, Elara’s emotional labor. Coincidence (finding the photo) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution hinges on Elara’s choice to relay the message.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: listening as protection, echoes as lifelines. The final image—Clara feeling her mother’s heartbeat—answers the central question (“Can the dead heal the living?”) without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (the unspoken decades of guilt) and objects (the hearing aid as bridge). Avoids sentimentality by grounding transcendence in tactile detail (“fingers tracing the smiles”).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Elara’s perceptual signature (“contact tracer for hearts,” noticing emotional residue). Voice modulates with pressure—lyric in description (“shadows pooling like forgotten sighs”), taut in action (“Elara moved quietly”). No head-hopping; Clara’s interiority is inferred through behavior. Diction remains within Elara’s plausible lexicon, avoiding register drift even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (“mist thickened, carrying a tremor she couldn't ignore”). Figurative language is purposeful (“shadows pooling like forgotten sighs”) and consistent—no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in opening paragraph (“reeling hush” appears thrice), but no loops or scaffold. Sentence variety supports rhythm; closure line (“hearts pulsing faintly onward”) resonates without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise transforms ghost-story tropes through specificity: “contact tracer for hearts” reframes mediumship as public health. The hearing aid—a period-authentic object—grounds supernatural mechanics in tangible history. Risk-taking (lyric density, causal reliance on relic) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth outweighs novelty; Clara’s grief feels lived, not archetypal.</comment>
