<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—“equations for hope”—is vividly embodied through micro-choices: redirecting flows, calibrating the sextant, rerouting coolant. Her “functionally creative” trait drives action under pressure without over-explaining. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; wonder is stoic, not sentimental. The final Charged Poise (“walked out into the light”) earns closure with visible cost: time spent, solitude embraced, decay confronted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the terminal hums with “quiet promise,” Elara departs having reconfigured decay into possibility. The Causal lens holds—each engineering act logically enables the next—and cost is legible in her solitary labor and the irreversible commitment of effort. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The abandoned terminal functions as active micro-setting: bulkheads whisper stress fractures, skylights align stellar inputs, conduits “snake like veins.” Every spatial detail constrains or enables Elara’s choices—e.g., rooftop collectors feed gravity-fed water loops. The sextant’s celestial arc charges the final image by aligning Polaris through a “cracked dome,” fusing tool, body, and environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—salvaging forgotten infrastructure—is signaled early and tightens when Elara confronts the dead resonator. Her agency drives escalation: she redirects flows, flushes rust, unseals vents. Cost is felt in hours of “stoic exploration” and irreversible tinkering, though the absence of external opposition slightly softens pressure intensity required for 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: hope as redirected intention, not miracle. The resonator’s awakening reweights decay as latent potential, avoiding moralizing. Final image—“equations for hope etched in her mind”—offers non-literal answer to the central question, with conceptual cost: renewal demands precise, lonely labor, not carnival chaos.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV remains tightly focalized through Elara’s engineer gaze: she notices “stress fractures,” “dormant service panels,” “fractal patterns of flow.” Voice modulates rhythm under pressure—shorter sentences during splicing, lyrical cadence at dawn. No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon (“auxiliary lines,” “heat sinks”). Perceptual signature is consistent and profession-inflected.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “maze of intentions,” “conduits snaking like veins,” “rust flaked away in rivulets.” Figurative language serves causality—no purple prose. Minor scaffold in “functionally creative” repetition (−0.2), but no loops or register drift. Closure beat (“humming with quiet promise”) avoids artifact interference.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: civil engineering as poetic resurrection, carnival aftermath as fertile void. Tropes (abandoned spaceport, antique tool) are transformed by specificity—sextant calibrates star-sight, flows are rerouted via cargo-bay auxiliaries. Risk-taking (engineering-as-hope) heightens stakes without gimmickry; vision feels singular, not prompt-derived.</comment>
