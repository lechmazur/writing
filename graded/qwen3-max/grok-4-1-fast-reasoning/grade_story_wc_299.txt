<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Harl’s interiority is vividly embodied—his trembling hands, roadie grit fused with appraiser precision—and his contradictory impulses (hiding vs. acting, facts vs. feeling) operate simultaneously during the scrap appraisal. His micro-choice to authenticate the relic and fund Jax’s memorial feels earned by prior causality. However, the emotional shift leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness (“emotion fueled the next verse”) rather than fully dramatized transformation, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Harl reconfigures his purpose from hiding to salvaging stories, with visible cost (career shame, grief) legible in the final image of him driving out. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through repeated “scrap” motifs and echoing blasts until the cadence shifts at decision. The trailer recedes as a closed chapter, satisfying the Orientation Test early and maintaining causal integrity within the lyric mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The quarry office trailer functions as a potent micro-setting: its thin walls amplify blasting echoes that mirror Harl’s longing, and the grimy windows frame his isolation. Crucially, the setting supplies the inciting object (the unearthed scrap) and pressures his choice—proximity to the band’s burial site forces confrontation. The final image of “golden dust” and receding trailer charges closure, fulfilling the 9+ gate via object-as-setting constraining emotional trajectory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding purpose after public failure and personal loss—is signaled early and tightens when the scrap appears, forcing Harl to choose between continued retreat or action. The deepening occurs when facts confirm the relic’s origin, raising emotional stakes. Though coincidence introduces the scrap, it complicates rather than resolves; agency drives the climax (calling the foreman). Cost is felt but not fully dramatized in tactical consequence—hence just below 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: value isn’t market-driven but forged in memory and loss. The scrap’s “incalculable sentimental provenance” reframes worth without moralizing. Final image—Harl driving into horizon pull—offers non-literal answer to “after the applause”: life continues through salvaged meaning. Avoids sentimentality by grounding insight in tactile particulars (weaves intertwining, rust-dated cloth), though slight abstraction in “emotion fueled the next verse” tempers full resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: roadie-meets-appraiser diction (“wrested,” “grit fused with precision”) modulates under pressure, compressing into shorter phrases during climax. POV remains tightly controlled, with perceptual bias filtering details (noticing weave density before emotion). Repetition of “confidently uncertain” and “wrest” is pattern-taught early and paid off, avoiding scaffold. Minor register drift in “emotion fueled the next verse” slightly breaches voice consistency at peak beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., carbon dating via rust). Sentence rhythm varies effectively—longer descriptive lines early, tighter clauses during decision. However, adjacent repetitions (“wrested… wrested,” “scrap by scrap”) and three uses of “confidently uncertain” verge on scaffold. No fatal artifacts, but minor loops prevent 9+; closure image remains sharp despite slight overwriting in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of roadie nostalgia and appraiser rigor transforms the “rock relic” trope through specific occupational detail (weave density, polyester blend). “After the applause” becomes active framework, not motif. Risk-taking in lyric-accumulative structure pays off with resonant closure. Only slight derivativeness in redemption arc prevents 9+; still, specificity of Echo Valley Quarry and amp cloth grounds originality.</comment>
