<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lirien’s motivation—grounding spirits his brother failed to save—is concrete, consistent, and intensifies under pressure. His internal conflict (grief vs. duty) manifests through embodied choices: kneeling in silt, piercing knots despite accumulating silence. The final act of mask restoration for the fisherman’s shade crystallizes his arc without sentimentality. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through porcelain shards and needlework.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lirien forecloses his personal unrest by grounding others, with visible cost (hush-stained needle, lingering lucid unrest). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds via knot-unraveling density, not causality. Starlight prisms pulse warnings, silt yields the net, and each spirit exhumed tightens thematic stakes. Final image reconfigures silence from trap to settled murmurs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary isn’t backdrop—it constrains choice: refracted light reveals net location, starlight dictates timing, silt burial demands tactile excavation. Tools (needle) and body (scarred hands) function as micro-setting, directly enabling the climax. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—Lirien perceives “silence pooling like ink” amid visual rainbows. Final dawn threat pales stars, charging closure with temporal precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing silenced spirits—is signaled early and deepens via the net’s curse. Protagonist agency drives escalation: Lirien chooses precise unraveling over force, risking shattered souls. Cost is legible—his brother’s ghost haunts him, unrest coils in his chest, needle stains with hush. Final knot’s resistance raises stakes, but no new constraint emerges beyond established rules.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme—silence as both prison and balm—emerges through action: knots accumulate muteness, masks restore voiceless identity. Subtext thrives in gaps (fisherman’s withheld secret, brother’s unbroken mask). Final image reweights premise: restoration weaves purpose from silence, but “knots reformed in memory’s net” avoids tidy resolution. No moralizing; resonance stems from porcelain mending under prisms.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is immaculate: Lirien notices “bait-flicker” shades, “whalesong silences,” hush “bloated with screams.” Rhythm modulates—long sentences for secret-sharing, staccato beats during needle-plunges. Voice remains single-POV, free of head-hopping; even the shade’s dialogue filters through Lirien’s lucid unrest. Syntax mirrors craft: tapestry-needle precision in prose structure itself.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density: “porcelain smile” implies fragility and artifice; “starlight wheeled overhead” conveys time passage kinetically. Minimal loops—each image serves multiple functions (prisms refract light, warn via color, mark time). One near-overwrite: “interlaced hush” slightly overused, but pattern-taught early and pays off in closure. Final line’s “knots forever undone” crystallizes theme without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise transforms tropes: mask-restorer as grief-laborer, fisherman’s net as woven silence. Specificity abounds—whalesong-derived hush, eclipse-cursed net, prism-refracted warnings. Risk-taking (accumulative texture over plot causality) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular: restoration as exhumation, silence as tangible substance. No derivative echoes; every detail serves character and closure.</comment>
