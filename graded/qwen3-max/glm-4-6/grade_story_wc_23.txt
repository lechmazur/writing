<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The navigator’s grief is embodied through tactile memory (patches, censer foot) and micro-choices (not answering the phone, sketching the map), avoiding diagnostic labels. His contradictory impulses—longing to return vs. accepting loss—act simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation (“walk on his own”) is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the fading map and aching joints. Flaws like reliance on ritual feel human, not contrived.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: he stops needing the phone, internalizing navigation. Cost is legible in “map would fade with the dawn” and “joints aching.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via moon phases, patches, censer warmth—and the final image reweights all prior motifs. Orientation anchors instantly (“patchwork navigator,” “starlit signal station”), and the single shard tightens cleanly to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The censer foot functions as micro-setting, constraining choice (guides hand, pulses with moon) and charging the final image (placed at map’s center). Station details (“dusty glass,” “frayed wire”) reflect emotional decay without over-description. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sight under grief’s urgency. The moon’s silver coin metaphor ties environment to thematic closure without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—navigating loss—is signaled early and deepens when the censer foot “grew hot,” forcing the final line. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses not to answer the phone, trusting instinct over external input. Cost is unmistakable in “map would fade” and “sea had taken everything.” The moon-phase constraint shapes tactics (timing, emotional calibration) with tangible tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: patches = memories, censer = compass, map = scars. Final image offers non-literal answer—navigation *is* solace—repricing “reverse migration” from futile return to honoring loss. Avoids moralizing; resonance stems from “geography of loss etched into him.” Ambiguity lingers (will he keep walking?), but emotional truth feels earned, not abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: notices seams, patina, frayed wires—tactile remnants of absence. Rhythm modulates from meditative tracing to urgent sketching, then stillness. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained (no omniscience). Lyric compression (“stars blinked, indifferent”) is taught early and pays off in closure whisper. Diction stays within lexicon—no register drift even in peak grief.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High information density: “frayed wool stitched to weathered canvas” conveys history and character in 6 words. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“He lifted,” “Outside,” “The phone rang”). Figurative language is coherent (moon as “silver coin,” grief as “geography”). One minor slip: “raw, fragile thing” slightly edges toward label, but redeemed by immediate action (“began to walk”).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms “grief journey” trope via specific mechanics: moon-phased censer, patchwork coat as emotional cartography. Risk-taking (silent phone, ephemeral map) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight—each element (patches, bronze, hydraulics failure) interlocks causally. Vision is singular: loss as navigable terrain, not obstacle to overcome.</comment>
