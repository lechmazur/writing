<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aria’s motivation—rooted in her “persistently curious nature”—is consistent and embodied through micro-choices (e.g., investigating beyond the photograph, trusting anomalous pulses). Her interiority avoids therapy-speak; emotions are filtered through sensory perception (“pull in her chest,” equipment trembling). However, her flaw lacks active complication: curiosity never costs her anything tangible mid-story, weakening the “visible cost” requirement for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Margaret’s silenced truth is validated, reweighting historical injustice with social cost. The causal lens holds—each discovery (photo, hearing aid, music box) follows from Aria’s methodical actions. Cost is legible in the final image: relief replaces sorrow, implying emotional labor and moral burden assumed. Setup/payoff is tight, though the institutional abuse reveal leans slightly expository.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium isn’t just backdrop—it enables the work (“perfect atmospheric conditions”) and evolves with tension (“mist thickened... boundary thinning”). The hearing aid and photograph function as micro-settings that constrain choice: Aria must interpret pulses, not spoken words. Final image (“reeling hush... felt different”) charges atmosphere with earned emotional resonance. Minor deduction: spatial choreography of the music box compartment lacks tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting vulnerable voices—is signaled early and deepens when the sister’s institutionalization reframes the photo’s erasure. Aria’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to follow pulses despite ambiguity. Cost is conceptual (bearing witness to buried trauma) and felt (equipment trembling, emotional weight). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; truth emerges through her method. Tightening occurs at the music box discovery, foreclosing easy assumptions about grief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme—truth as protection for the voiceless—emerges through objects (scratched photo, hearing aid pulses) rather than assertion. Subtext thrives in silence: Margaret’s deafness becomes metaphor for societal refusal to hear abuse victims. Final image offers non-literal resolution: relief in the atrium reweights silence from sorrow to justice. Avoids moralizing; complexity honored (father’s abuse, family’s complicity).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable, first-person limited to Aria’s sensory and emotional field. Voice modulates under pressure: prose tightens during pulse detection (“waves of energy appeared”), then expands lyrically at closure. Distinct perceptual signature—Aria notices emotional imprints, not visual details. No dialogue to evaluate. Minor flaw: slight register drift in “incidental heroism” phrase, which borders on abstract labeling.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and purposeful (“mist-clad atrium,” “reeling hush”), with strong verbs (“clutched,” “scratched out,” “trembled”). Sentences vary rhythmically; paragraphs breathe with scene needs. One paraphrase loop: “persistently curious nature” repeated twice with minimal variation. No scaffold or purple prose; metaphors cohere (mist = liminal space, pulses = unheard truth). Final line lands cleanly without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Premise transforms tropes: “contact tracer for hearts” merges epidemiological framing with emotional archaeology. Originality lies in grounding supernatural elements in tactile realism (hearing aid pulses, scratched photo). Risk-taking—deaf protagonist recording truth via bio-energy—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Synthesis feels inevitable: curiosity + unconventional method + twilight setting = revelation that reconfigures history. Fresh inflection in using disability as conduit for truth.</comment>
