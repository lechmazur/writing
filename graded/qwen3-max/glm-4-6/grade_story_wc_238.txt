<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eloise’s interiority is richly embodied—her grief, guilt, and resolve manifest through precise physical actions (climbing the ladder, steady hands) and sensory perception (“gravel and starlight” voice). Her contradictory impulses (fear vs. duty, shame vs. longing) operate simultaneously in scene, not as summary. The apology to Alistair feels earned by decades of avoidance, and her final micro-choice—to return the bottle as a “quiet monument”—carries visible emotional cost. Flaws are genuine: her past silence and his cowardice aren’t sanitized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is masterfully executed as Earned Stasis: Alistair’s spirit dissolves into peace after mutual acknowledgment, foreclosing their century-long haunting with resonant cost. The causal lens holds tightly—Eloise’s device enables contact *because* prior methods failed, and the orchard’s impending demolition raises stakes without resolving them. Orientation is immediate (“ghosts in the sheet music archive”), and the perfume bottle’s glow signals transformation without exposition. The final image reconfigures silence from absence to resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sheet music archive functions as micro-setting: dust trembling with dissonant whispers, towering shelves of forgotten scores, and the high shelf where only Eloise would look—all constrain access and charge atmosphere. The antique perfume bottle is tactilely specific (“iridescent and delicate,” “silver filigree”) and directly shapes the climax. However, the orchard outside remains abstract; its “hush” evokes mood but doesn’t alter Eloise’s tactics beyond thematic pressure, missing the 9+ gate for environmental constraint on choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—delivering an overdue apology—is signaled early and tightens under dual pressures: the archive’s demolition and Alistair’s stubborn silence. Eloise’s agency drives escalation: she abandons metaphor for direct current, risking failure. The cost is legible in her admission: “I’ve been running from it ever since.” The orchard’s falling trees loom as irreversible loss, making this final attempt urgent and irreplaceable. Coincidence never resolves; peace comes only through earned confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: imperfect miracles don’t erase the past but make its weight bearable. This crystallizes in the closure—Alistair’s sorrow transforms into peace, not erasure, and the bottle becomes a “monument to a mended bond.” Subtext thrives in silence (the archive’s held breath), light (mournful blue to brilliant pulse), and the oscillator’s hum—a language beyond words. No moralizing; the insight arises from concrete particulars: glass, current, apology.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is flawlessly controlled single-third, filtered through Eloise’s professional yet haunted sensibility (“gossip-column exorcist,” “residual hauntings”). Voice modulates under pressure: lyrical (“gravel and starlight”) early, taut during the ritual (“hands steady despite the tremor”), tender at closure. Syntax varies purposefully—longer sentences for atmosphere, fragments for tension (“Time to try something new”). No head-hopping; even Alistair’s voice emerges as spectral echo, not interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: “dissonant chorus that made the fine dust on the shelves tremble” merges sound, setting, and emotion. Figurative language is coherent (hauntings as “skipped records,” silence as “held breath”) and never muddled. Minor scaffold in “she’d tried everything over the years” slightly flattens momentum, but the oscillator’s description avoids technobabble. Final paragraph’s cadence—“slow, steady march of progress”—resonates without redundancy. No loops or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fusion of ghost story, archival intimacy, and electrical exorcism—transforming tropes through specificity (perfume bottle vessel, oscillator device). The “ethereal grit” tone balances poetic imagery (“mournful blue light”) with procedural detail (“slender leads to silver filigree”). Risk-taking (scientific method for spiritual contact) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight: only this character, in this archive, with this object, could achieve this imperfect miracle.</comment>
