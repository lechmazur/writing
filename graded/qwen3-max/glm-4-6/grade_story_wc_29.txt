<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—she acts from scientific integrity and concern for societal fracture—but her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction. Emotions remain summarized (“cautiously hopeful,” “increasingly isolated”) rather than enacted through micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation (sabotaging signals alone) carries cost, yet her competence borders on frictionless, weakening struggle. A stronger showing of doubt or error would elevate this to 9+ range.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara’s quiet victory forecloses cosmic manipulation at personal risk, with felt cost in isolation and professional peril. The Causal lens holds—her actions directly degrade the signal—and the 2:17 AM timing creates a live constraint. However, the community’s off-page healing dilutes immediacy; the decisive change occurs entirely in solitude, slightly muting stakes. Still, the ending crystallizes a before/after with resonant poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The university radio station functions effectively as micro-setting, supplying both tools (subsonic jammer) and vulnerability (funding threats). Astronomical charts recur with evolving purpose—from analysis to tactical planning—and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective (dim glow, headphones, chaotic signals), filtered through Elara’s professional urgency. Yet the setting doesn’t actively *constrain* her final choice beyond providing equipment; it enables more than pressures, narrowly missing the 9-band gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting humanity from manipulative cosmic influence—is signaled early and tightens at 2:17 AM, when failure risks exposure. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she repurposes existing tech, acting alone under institutional threat. Cost is visible (career, isolation), though the “power plays” among departments feel abstract rather than personally pressuring. One meaningful deepening occurs (realizing signals respond to media), but external antagonism remains off-stage, softening tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: truth vs. manufactured consensus, with cosmic tricksters exploiting human division. Subtext thrives in the signal’s responsiveness to interpretation—a critique of epistemic fragility. The ending reweights prior events: silence becomes victory, not absence. Avoids moralizing; instead, “ethereal grit” implies enduring vigilance. However, the religious/military/startup factions serve as thematic shorthand without deep interweaving, slightly flattening complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, precise, and scientifically inflected without jargon overload. POV remains tightly focalized through Elara; perceptual signature shows in her attention to patterns and distrust of narrative convenience. Prose modulates under pressure—shorter sentences near climax—but maintains rhythmic coherence. No dialogue avoids pitfalls; narration trusts dramatization over explanation. Minor deduction: slight uniformity in sentence openings during exposition, but never obscures clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lean, with high information density: each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Syntax varies purposefully; paragraph cuts align with beats. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse but potent (“cosmic tricksters,” “celestial silence”). Final line resonates without overstatement. One near-miss: “structured signals that defied conventional explanation” borders on generic, but specificity quickly returns. Otherwise, line-level craft is publish-ready.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise transforms SETI tropes by making alien signals maliciously adaptive rather than benevolent or cryptic. “Cosmic tricksters” reframes first-contact narratives as psychological warfare. Integration of subsonic jamming—a plausible, understated countermeasure—feels fresh and grounded. Risk-taking in quiet climax pays off: victory is technical, not spectacular. Originality lies in diagnosing signal *responsiveness* as the trap, not content. Fully committed to its conceit without gimmickry.</comment>
