<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tomas’s reluctant duty, embodied nausea, and paradoxical gift reveal layered interiority under pressure. His micro-choices—arranging components, stepping back, calling out—show a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The line “what remained of his humanity had written the blueprint in first place” deepens motivation without over-explaining. However, the traveler’s minimal presence limits relational crucible testing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Tomas endures the orchard’s burden to guide another, foreclosing escape with frost-kissed fingertips as tangible cost. The causal chain—blueprint → assembly → impressions → luminous path—is tight and motivated. Orientation is immediate (“orchard,” “Tomas,” “cliffs”), and the Situational lens holds: coherent pressure forces stance crystallization. The final image reconfigures the orchard’s light dimming slightly—proof of cost paid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, and frost-laced air aren’t backdrop—they constrain every choice. Tomas slips on gravel; frost forms daggers on bird wings; the nut pulses blue only when assembled correctly. The orchard itself is a tactile, sentient antagonist whose cursed glow dims in response to Tomas’s act. Setting charges the final image: frost on fingertips mirrors the orchard’s partial appeasement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—saving travelers from the orchard’s curse—is signaled early and tightens as frost descends and birds circle. Tomas’s agency drives escalation: he assembles, activates, and guides despite personal cost (morning sickness, cursed blood). The mechanical birds’ logic is confounded by his “nearly-living” impressions—a credible complication, not coincidence. Cost is unmistakable: his humanity erodes even as he preserves another’s life.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: graceless beauty in sacrifice, duty as self-erasure. The blueprint—written by Tomas’s past self—implies cyclical futility transformed into purpose. No moralizing; resonance lives in the orchard’s dimmed light and warm nut against palm. Final line reweights the premise: salvation is possible, but only through continued burden—conceptual repricing with emotional cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Tomas’s sensory and emotional state (“hair tangled with orchard leaves,” “breath fogging”). Voice modulates with pressure: clipped syntax during assembly, lyrical flow at closure (“luminous path winding through the labyrinth entrance”). Diction stays within plausible lexicon—no register drift. The perceptual signature (noticing shifting symbols, moonlight wires) feels character-specific and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “gears salvaged from fallen birds, wires woven from strands of moonlight” does triple duty. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes during assembly, tightens during bird shrieks. Minor flaw: “crystal者” appears mid-text—an apparent typo that momentarily breaks immersion. Otherwise, no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language serves causality (“shadows like reaching arms” foreshadows guidance).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise transforms tropes: cursed orchard + mechanical sentinels + forgotten blueprint become specific through Tomas’s biology (“cursed blood,” morning sickness) and tactile worldbuilding. The nut’s shifting symbols and compass pointing to “human warmth” feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (non-human protagonist, abstract method of “impressions”) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision coheres: every element serves the theme of sacrificial navigation.</comment>
