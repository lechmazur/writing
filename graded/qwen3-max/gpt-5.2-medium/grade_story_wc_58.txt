<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The narrator’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—grief, craft, and restraint intertwine without therapy-speak. The queen’s lonesome splendor (“wet stones under moonlight”) reveals character through precise perception, not exposition. Their micro-choices—brushing wrists, humming breath across a thread—are charged with emotional cost. Final renunciation (writing death without killing) is earned by consistent motive and flaw: the obituarist heals others but carries his own map of departures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: absence becomes navigable geography, not wound. The red thread anchors causality from setup to payoff, and the “last ship” timeframe tightens every choice. Orientation is immediate (“After the last ship sailed...”), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via sensory layering until the final image reweights loss as meaning. Cost is legible in the queen’s leaned weight and the narrator’s marked skin.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The shadowed autumn garden isn’t backdrop—it’s active crucible: black-netted roses, leaf decay, and crooked pear tree constrain mood and method. The carpet thread functions as micro-setting, its texture (“red as a cut lip”) shaping projection mechanics. Final image ties thread to skin, proving environment charges closure. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—perfume, breath, warmth over visual detail in climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming absence into explained geography—is signaled early and deepened through the queen’s request: “write my son dead without killing him.” The meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator projects presence, narrowing options to one fragile bridge of breath and thread. Cost is felt in the queen’s curled fingers and the narrator’s stuttered breath—agency crystallizes in quiet endurance, not action. Coincidence never resolves; healing emerges only through shared, intimate labor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: grief as cartography, healing as geography. No moralizing—the queen’s insight (“healing was a geography, not a miracle”) is dramatized through soil-listening, not declared. Final image reweights departure as weaveable meaning, rejecting sentimentality for earned resonance. The red thread compass suggests absences can guide, not just wound—a non-literal answer to the central question of how to live with irrevocable loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is singular, lyrical yet precise—syntax modulates from flowing description to terse intimacy (“my sleeve brushed her wrist”). Perceptual signature is consistent: salt, coal smoke, sorrowful perfume filter all observation. No head-hopping; even the queen’s interior is rendered through external cues (eyes like wet stones). Elision is purposeful (“rumor does not hold a pen”), taught early and paid off in the charged silence of projection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence layers atmosphere, character, and stakes (“palace hill rose like a dark lantern”). Figurative language is coherent: weaving, mapping, and breath motifs interlock without strain. Zero loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally (long descriptive sentences yield to short beats during projection). Final line (“every departure can be woven into meaning”) resonates without redundancy, closing the textile motif with emotional precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Premise—obituaries for the living—is transformed through specific ritual (“projecting presence”) and tactile logic (carpet thread as relic). Emotional truth outweighs novelty: the son’s soil-listening habit grounds metaphysics in behavior. Risk-taking (lyric structure, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels wholly original—a fusion of elegy, craft, and cartography that avoids template tropes through irreplaceable details like “healing is a geography.”</comment>
