<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is richly embodied—her pensive mirth, tactile engagement with tools, and micro-choices (e.g., choosing to display rather than hoard her art) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in loss and rediscovery. Her motivation intensifies credibly from personal yearning to communal offering. The final bow to “ghosts” crystallizes her earned shift from isolation to shared joy without sentimentality. Flaws like resignation are shown through action, not label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Mara reweights art’s purpose from ownership to invitation, with visible cost (abandoning proprietary control). The dream logic is taught early (“daydream,” “paper moths”) and pays off coherently; the prism lamp’s reuse in waking life validates the vision. The fresco/film alignment drives causality, and the final image—her hand painting light—makes the cost legible: vulnerability as method. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held consistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains and enables: fog becomes a projection screen, mud-swallowed walls house the recess for the fragment. Tools (prism lamp, film) function as micro-settings that dictate tactics. Final image charges the setting: fog transformed into communal canvas. Sensory detail is selective (wool-like fog, splintered sheds) and filtered through Mara’s artist POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rediscovering joy through art—is signaled early and deepens when Mara shifts from seeking a relic to creating participatory light. Agency drives escalation: she aligns film/fragment, threads film into lamp, chooses public display. Cost is felt: relinquishing solitary authorship for fragile, ephemeral sharing. Coincidence (moths delivering clues) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Mara’s choices do.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: joy as shared, impermanent practice, not owned artifact. The ending reweights the premise—art as doorway, not monument—without moralizing. Recurring images (light, fog, fragments) accrue meaning: fog shifts from obfuscation to medium. Subtext lives in gesture (bowing to ghosts) and silence (crowd’s wordless gathering), resisting tidy binaries about memory or creation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure (shorter clauses during projection scene). Perceptual signature is consistent—Mara notices color, texture, light first. Dream logic is taught early (“paper moths”) and maintained; no head-hopping. Diction stays within artist POV (“recessive laughter,” “prism lamp”), avoiding register drift even in elevated moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language is coherent (fog as wool, memories as “impolite negatives”) and peaks without muddle. Minor overwriting in one beat (“colors clung to surfaces, the way dawn clings to dew”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s clarity and resonance offset this hairline slip.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise transforms tropes (lost fresco, artist’s block) through specificity: painting with light via prism/film, knowledge network as paper moths. Emotional truth grounds ingenuity—Mara’s joy is practical, rebuildable. Risk-taking (dream logic, abstract stakes) heightens meaning without gimmickry. The synthesis—film as memory conduit, fog as canvas—feels inevitable in hindsight and irreplaceable to closure.</comment>
