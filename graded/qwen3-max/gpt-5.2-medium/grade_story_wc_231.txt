<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eamon’s “softly persistent” trait manifests in embodied micro-choices—pressing the Edelweiss to the post, pinning it to the logbook—that reveal his hierarchy of values: preserving absence over claiming truth. His borrowed-memory limitation (“only fragments that arrived between blanks”) creates credible struggle without safety-hedging. The harbor clerk’s internal contradiction—duty versus curiosity—is subtly rendered through sensory noticing (“boards shining like pearl through mist”) rather than diagnostic labels. Final renunciation (anchoring the name without owning it) is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image reweights memory itself as something that belongs in gaps, not archives, with undeniable social cost (the keeper as repository of others’ missing parts). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure escalates via density of observed absences (“missing smell,” “no sand in seams”) until the knot’s wrongness triggers decisive action. Cost is legible in Eamon’s thickening loneliness and the clerk’s voiced name, which forecloses anonymity. Every beat tightens around the central mystery without causal breaks or amnesia.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The opal dock functions as micro-setting: its “rope scars” and piling rhythm directly enable the discovery under the post, while mist and nautical twilight constrain perception and urgency. Sensory detail is filtered through the clerk’s harbor-trained attention (“absent call of gulls,” boot seams), avoiding tourist cataloguing. The lighthouse beam’s periodic intrusion charges key moments without overt symbolism. Final image of Eamon lit “like a far star” ties environment to theme—cold witness as vocation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decoding the stranger’s final gesture—is signaled early and deepens when the boutonniere’s “mountain coldness” implies hidden geography. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: Eamon’s gap-observing method narrows options until the alpine cord detail forces a physical search. Cost is felt in the clerk’s complicity (voicing the name) and Eamon’s reinforced isolation. Coincidence never resolves; the waterproof packet’s discovery stems directly from prior observation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as fragmented, communal stewardship rather than private possession. The Edelweiss shifts from personal token to archival anchor, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Final action—sliding the packet into the logbook—offers non-literal resolution: history can “anchor without being owned.” Subtext operates in silence (the empty grip), gesture (pinning the flower), and implication (the traded mind), avoiding prompt-like articulation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person harbor clerk POV remains stable, with perceptual signature rooted in occupational bias (“ropes scars,” boot seams). Voice modulates under pressure: lyrical density during revelation (“loneliness...thicken”), then sparse clarity for the name-speaking. Syntax mirrors focalizer’s dawning comprehension—longer sentences for observation, fragments for realization (“a wound”). No head-hopping; Eamon’s interiority is inferred solely through action and dialogue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density (“opal dock lay under mist,” “beam in slow pulses”) with rhythmic variation supporting tension. One minor artifact: “borrowed memories not his own” slightly edges toward label-speak but is immediately grounded in tactile action (touching petals). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final paragraph’s cadence crystallizes stakes without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-as-archaeology through coastal/mountain juxtaposition. The “gap-observing” method transforms standard detective tropes into poetic epistemology. Specificity abounds: alpine cord vs. salt rope, nautical twilight’s liminal light, Edelweiss as altitude-badge. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over plot mechanics) heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight yet wholly original.</comment>
