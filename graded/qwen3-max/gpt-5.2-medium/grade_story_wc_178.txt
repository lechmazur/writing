<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Nabu-iddin’s frugality, grief, and empirical rigor cohere into a singular worldview that drives every micro-choice—from reusing tablets to snapping his stylus—with visible cost. His internal contradiction (trust in measurement vs. participation in encrypted devotion) acts simultaneously in scene, not as alternating states. The final renunciation—sacrificing certainty—is earned by prior causality and embodied through the bone stylus, a tool imbued with personal calibration marks. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion manifests through tactile restraint and precise action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the covenant demands surrender of certainty, reweighting the entire premise of empirical knowledge. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds via schematic representations, lapis tile, star charts—culminating in a cadence shift at the mirror-face reveal. Cost is legible in the snapped stylus and new constellations on his palms. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The reimagined Babylonian palace functions as micro-setting: glass roofs enable observation, baked-brick arches conceal bricked stairwells, rubble hides the tile—all constraining choices. The lapis tile, bone stylus, and linen-wrapped curtain serve as tactile extensions of setting that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective (cool darkness, evening-water mirror) and filtered through astronomer’s priorities. Final constellations drawn on palms fuse body and cosmos, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—sealing a covenant with the unknown—is signaled early and deepens when the tile’s vow demands faith expressed through arithmetic. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: testing numbers, waiting for Mars, placing the tile, snapping the stylus. Each act narrows options; the final cost (loss of certainty) is unmistakable. Coincidence (mason’s gift) complicates but does not resolve—the tile’s power is verified empirically before use.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: devotion to the unknown requires relinquishing empirical certainty, yet the path to that surrender is paved with measurement. The final image—constellations on palms, sky no empire owns—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates through schematic diagrams, mirror-face, and broken stylus; no prompt-like articulation. Ambiguity lingers (Who is the unnamed presence?) without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Nabu-iddin notices angles, copper nails, reused linen—never tourist details. Syntax modulates under pressure: short clauses during Mars-crossing vigil, lyrical flow at revelation. Voice remains consistent in elevated but plausible diction (“empirically ironic,” “dusky harmony”) rooted in character lexicon. No head-hopping; single POV maintained with controlled psychic distance. Elision (students scattered, treasury stripped) is purposeful and paid off through present frugality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the sky still paid in steady light,” “borrowing him to look back.” Figurative language is sparse in high-pressure beats, coherent when used (mirror-face, evening water). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Final line (“devoted to what he could not name”) recharges opening’s “patrons who no longer existed” with earned resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Babylonian astronomy, magic squares, and covenant theology feels inevitable in hindsight. The “empirically ironic” stance transforms trope of rationalist encountering mysticism into a specific moral calculus: faith demanded in the language of verification. Risk-taking (bricked stairwell, featureless mask) heightens stakes without gimmickry. No derivative echoes; voice, concept, and closure cohere as singular artistic vision.</comment>
