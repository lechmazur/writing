<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s internal conflict—shame over breaking a promise to her brother—manifests physically in her posture and emotionally through the crater glass, avoiding diagnostic labels. The protagonist’s micro-choice to test emotional routes via bird seeds reveals a hierarchy of values (truth over convenience). Both characters’ flaws directly generate the central crisis and its resolution. The final apology carries visible relational cost and reconfigures their shared past.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ridge trail reappears only after Mira’s spoken confession fills the gap in the crater glass, making before/after legible with emotional cost. Causal lens holds throughout—each discovery (seeds, dread spiral, doorway) motivates the next action. The geode’s rules are consistent and dramatized, not exposited. Cost is crystallized in the line: “a life without routes becomes a room without doors.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The iridescent geode functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—it hoards severed emotional paths and only yields them through embodied ritual (foam, confession). Crater glass and sea foam are tactile tools that charge the final image. Sensory detail (“blues that look like laughter in mourning clothes,” “luminescent algae”) filters through the recollectionist’s professional bias. Spatial choreography remains coherent from cliff face to central cavern.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering vanished emotional routes—is signaled early and tightens when physical trails disappear. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: conjecture → seed-following → crater-glass reading → confrontation with Mira’s regret. Cost is unmistakable: Mira must publicly voice shame to restore connection. The geode’s “account-keeping” raises conceptual stakes without resolving via coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: unspoken ruptures erase shared realities. The final image—ridge trail shimmering into being after confession—offers a non-literal answer about repair requiring vulnerability. No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete particulars (foam pool sighing, seeds straightening). Counter-readings linger: Is the geode just or merely archival? Complexity avoids false equivalence—Mira’s choice matters.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: narrator notices “cheerful gloom,” “script that only the heart can read,” blending professional lexicon with poetic compression. Rhythm modulates under pressure—longer sentences for reflection, clipped phrases during dread spiral. No head-hopping; Mira’s dialogue carries subtext (“echoes returned only blank”). Voice remains consistent even in elevated diction because it’s character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density: “joy becomes loops, fear becomes jagged marks” does triple duty (characterize tool, advance plot, embody emotion). Minor overwriting in “blues that look like laughter in mourning clothes”—slightly mixed metaphor—but payoff justifies it. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary. Final line (“narrow ridge trail shimmered into being”) recharges opening’s “paths disappearing” with earned hope.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise transforms “lost memories” trope via emotional cartography—paths vanish when promises break. Crater glass as emotion-translator feels fresh yet inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric causality, geode as memory bank) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Every element coheres: bird seeds, foam, crystal—all serve the core question of how regret unmakes worlds. Vision feels singular, not prompt-derived.</comment>
