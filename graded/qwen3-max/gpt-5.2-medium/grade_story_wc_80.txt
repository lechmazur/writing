<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—“stoically sensitive,” measuring cracks while haunted by absence—and her micro-choices (wresting the beam, placing notes in mortar) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Her flaw (fixation on interlaced absence) drives every action without safety-hedging. The confrontation with Beran tests her endurance, not just competence, and her final act (“I am still listening”) crystallizes renunciation as agency. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied in trembling lanterns, wet sleeves, and ink like “a secret ember.”</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lira’s final note reconfigures the pavilion from ruin to archive, with cost legible in her solitude and Beran’s thwarted claim. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through recurring images (inkwell, submerged tiles, carved lions)—and the decisive intensification (slipping past patrol to seal notes in stone) narrows options irreversibly. Orientation is immediate (“After the drawbridge rises...”), and causality flows from motive to method without retroactive patches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion isn’t backdrop but crucible: water pressure resists stone-setting, mist swallows arches, silt boils like smoke during conflict—all constraining choice. The inkwell (micro-setting) charges the final image, warm against ribs as if approving. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: at climax, perception narrows to lantern flare in fog, then widens post-confrontation to city silhouettes. Every detail serves pressure or POV bias—no museum-tour cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mapping absence without dismissing it—is signaled early and deepens when Beran demands the inkwell, forcing Lira to choose between institutional erasure and private witness. Her agency (wresting skiff, shoving Beran into pillar) drives escalation, and cost is unmistakable: isolation, physical strain, and the irreversible act of embedding confessions in stone. The tightening forecloses archival custody, binding memory to riverbed instead.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: ink that “will not wash away,” chalk dissolving mid-mark, stones storing messages like clay stores footprints. The ending offers no moral but a resonant answer—dreams persist not by recovery but by charting their negative space. “Interlaced absence” isn’t stated but shown in silver mask releasing air, pillars leaning like tired dancers. Complexity endures: Lira knows she cannot recover her mother, yet her work keeps the dream alive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Lira notices what others ignore (buoyant beams, dissolving chalk), and rhythm modulates with pressure—longer sentences for reflection, staccato phrases during confrontation (“She pivots and shoves”). Free indirect style is clean; diction stays within surveyor-poet lexicon (“hushed blaze,” “interlaced absence”). No head-hopping; even Beran’s threat is filtered through Lira’s sensitivity. Elision is purposeful: backstory woven via concrete cues (mother’s dance, inkwell).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density: “moonlight filters down in pale ladders, igniting a hushed blaze across silted tiles” merges image, tone, and setting. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“After...”, “Tonight...”, “She...”). Figurative language is coherent—ember ink, boiling silt as smoke—and never obscures causality. Final line (“her hidden words will bind the pavilion back to memory”) recharges motifs without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms “lost mother” trope through specific stakes: archaeology as emotional cartography, foundations as message-bearers. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over plot mechanics) heightens thematic resonance without gimmickry. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight: inkwell’s survival enables vellum notes; drawbridge timing enables secrecy. No middle-ground hedging—Lira’s method is idiosyncratic, irreplaceable, and fully committed.</comment>
