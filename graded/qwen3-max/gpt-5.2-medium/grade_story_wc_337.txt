<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—hands shaking, vision sharpening under stress—and their motivation evolves from duty to ancestral reckoning. The final choice to break the vow is earned through micro-decisions (whispering their true name, stitching breath into mask) that reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over fear, connection over silence. Contradictory impulses (fear vs. duty, reverence vs. rebellion) act simultaneously in scene. The ancestor revelation lands with emotional and moral weight, not exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sanctuary shifts from haunted prison to inhabited space, with cost legible in the broken vow and the protagonist’s lineage burden. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the hush thickens, then unravels through syllables and starlight—and every beat tightens pressure toward the final knot. The slab lifting “like an eyelid” crystallizes the before/after with undeniable sensory and conceptual cost. Orientation is immediate and sustained; causality flows through tactile, ritual logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary isn’t backdrop—it actively bends constellations, hoards silence, then holds song; its salt mirrors and quartz stairs constrain access and reflect thematic duality. The tapestry needle and wet net function as micro-settings that shape tactics (unraveling by feel, stitching stormlight). Starlight evolves from distant witness to intimate listener, charging the final image. Every sensory detail serves pressure or closure—no white-room syndrome, no tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—grounding spirits by freeing the storm-spirit—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist learns the spirit is their ancestor, raising personal cost. Escalation is driven by agency: each knot unraveled releases sound and spirits, tightening the moral bind. The final choice forecloses familial secrecy with visible price—the vow broken, silence replaced by breath. Coincidence never resolves; pressure accumulates through ritual labor under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence born of fear unmoors the dead; only honest breath grants rest. The final image—sanctuary “inhabited rather than haunted,” quiet as “choice”—reweights every prior detail without moralizing. Masks, nets, and prisms accrue meaning through use, not declaration. The ancestor’s question (“why I had broken the vow”) invites reflection on inherited trauma, answered through action, not thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is exquisitely calibrated—a restorer’s tactile lexicon (“porcelain and resin,” “teased the strand loose”) fused with lyrical precision (“hush pressed back, dense as wool”). Psychic distance remains tight; perception degrades appropriately under stress (visions sharpening amid racing heart). Syntax varies rhythmically: short clauses for tension, flowing cadences for revelation. No head-hopping, no register drift—prose embodies a singular, haunted craftsperson’s mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“spirits gathered above the slab, their faces switching between the masks I had mended and the faces beneath”). Figurative language is coherent and purposeful (silence as “wool,” starlight as “prismatic threads”). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with stakes. Final line (“interlaced hush thinned into ordinary air”) resonates without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Premise transforms tropes: mask restoration becomes ancestral exorcism, storm-spirit burial critiques generational silence. Every element feels inevitable in hindsight—the net’s knots as fear-made-tangible, prisms as grief-refractors. Risk-taking (lyric structure, textural escalation) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision is singular: a world where silence has weight, breath has texture, and vows can drown the dead.</comment>
