<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is precise and embodied—her “ledger in her head” and obsession with fair trade manifest in micro-choices (hiding Mercy, writing in margins) that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her contradiction—con artist’s child who craves truth—is active, not abstract, and culminates in an Earned Stasis: she refuses Ivo’s con while accepting the cost of familial rupture. Sami and Ivo apply immediate, legible pressure; their presence sharpens Mara’s moral calculus without diluting focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara’s act of placing Mercy beside the unclaimed woman reconfigures truth as care, not transaction, with visible relational cost—Ivo “smaller” in the doorway. The Causal lens holds: each beat follows because/therefore logic (e.g., Mercy’s ink enables margin-writing, which alters agent behavior). Cost is legible in the final image: truth priced not in currency but in estrangement and quiet labor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The funeral prep room functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains choice: disinfectant air, stainless table, and toe tag supply both tools (Mercy hidden under towel rack) and moral pressure (unclaimed corpse as mirror to Sami). Sensory detail is purposeful—roses “that refused to die,” fluorescent lights embalming skin—and charges the closure when Mercy rests on folded hands, merging death and agency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth as currency for safety—tightens decisively when agents arrive, forcing Mara to choose between Ivo’s lie and Sami’s verifiable facts. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency: her “waiting actively” reshapes tactics (margin-writing), narrowing options until the affidavit becomes a live test. Cost is unmistakable: Ivo’s con collapses, and Mara’s relationship with him fractures irreparably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—Mercy’s ink, toe tags, equations—not abstraction. The ending offers a non-literal answer: truth isn’t bought but tended, like the unclaimed woman’s hands. Subtext thrives in silence (Mara sliding the tag) and image (ink shimmering through paper), avoiding moralizing while reweighting “fair trade” as ethical endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled first-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices numbers, symmetry, and transactional cues (“shuffle in those terms”). Voice modulates under pressure—syntax tightens during agent confrontation—but remains consistent. Dialogue carries subtext (Ivo’s charm vs. Sami’s quiet precision), and free indirect style merges seamlessly with action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or conflict (“air tasted of disinfectant and roses that refused to die”). Figurative language is coherent and purposeful (drain “gurgle like a throat clearing”), with no loops or scaffold. Final line (“feeling life keep working even here”) crystallizes tone without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesizing political asylum, embalming, and con artistry into a fresh moral calculus where truth is tendered through bureaucratic margins. The “liquefies rigid thinking” concept transforms a genre trope (magic object) into thematic engine. Risk-taking—centering a funeral home as site of asylum negotiation—heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
