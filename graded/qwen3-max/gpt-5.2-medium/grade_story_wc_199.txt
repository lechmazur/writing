<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lio’s motivation—decoding leafscript to honor the forgotten—is consistent, embodied, and escalates credibly into vault-breaking action. His internal contradiction (duty vs. truth-seeking) manifests through micro-choices like prodding leaves and building cairns. The final endurance (“orderly seed sorter again… transformed always into hope”) earns its cost: social dismissal, laborious monument-building, and moral burden. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions stay tactile (“mossy delight,” “fingers smell like rain”).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Veyroot shifts from floating on stolen names to shared memory, with visible cost (confession of elders, public reckoning). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds via leafscript intensification (“DESCEND” → “UNDO THE LATCH” → “LIFT”) and monument proliferation. Causality is tight: moonstone dust enables decoding, which drives vault access, which yields the book that catalyzes change. Final image (“LIFT… stayed written”) reweights all prior acts with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor isn’t backdrop—it constrains every choice: seeds must be sorted to keep it aloft, leaves fall only during “the hush,” and descent threatens when memory fails. Key objects (bone needle, moonstone dust) function as micro-settings that charge the climax: the needle’s transformation enables vault opening. Sensory specificity (“powdered with cold ash,” “smell like rain”) filters through Lio’s occupational bias. Final image (pearl-gray sky) reconfigures the setting’s meaning without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honoring the forgotten to prevent Veyroot’s fall—tightens decisively when “DESCEND” appears, foreclosing passive observation. Lio’s agency drives escalation: he decodes, builds monuments, breaches the vault. Cost is legible in foreman’s dismissal (social risk) and the elders’ blight-coverup (moral weight). The latch’s undoing crystallizes stance: memory as ballast outweighs institutional secrecy. Coincidence (leaf landing on THISTLE SUN jar) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the real work is Lio’s persistent prodding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme—memory as ethical ballast against historical erasure—emerges through concrete particulars: cairns, leafscript, blackened seeds. No moralizing; resonance accrues via the moonstone dust’s shift from hidden truth-revealer to public glitter on Lio’s skin. Final image (“LIFT… stayed written”) answers the central question non-literally: collective remembrance stabilizes more than labor or theft. Ambiguity lingers (Will the elders sustain this?), but the cost of forgetting is viscerally established.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is exquisitely calibrated: lyrical but precise (“pods tick like clocks,” “sky looked powdered with cold ash”), with syntax modulating under pressure (shorter sentences during vault breach). Perceptual signature is consistent—Lio notices weight, hush, moss, ash—filtered through his role as seed sorter. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Elision (compressed backstory of blight) is purposeful and paid off when the bark-paper book confesses theft. Diction stays within plausible lexicon (“cairn,” “cabochon” feel organic, not thesaurus-driven).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: nearly every line advances plot, character, or atmosphere (“His prod was a slender bone needle… knocking at a door”). Figurative language is coherent (moonstone dust = trapped star → truth-revealer → public glitter). Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“Near the root hall…”, “On the hush day…”, “He carried the leaf…”). Closure beat (“LIFT, then stayed written”) avoids overwriting—simple syntax amplifies impact. Minor deduction for one slightly ornate phrase (“moonstone cabochon dust speck”), but no artifacts obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Premise transforms folklore tropes via specific mechanics: memory as literal arboreal ballast, leafscript requiring moonstone-dust prodding. Every element feels irreplaceable—the bone needle couldn’t be a stick; “mossy delight” couldn’t be “joy.” Risk-taking (accumulative structure, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight: Veyroot’s theft origin retroactively justifies Lio’s monuments as counter-ballast. No derivative echoes; vision is singular and fully committed.</comment>
