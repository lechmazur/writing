<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is precise and embodied—her guilt manifests in hesitation at the crank, not abstract remorse. Her micro-choices (aligning scratch marks, removing lead weight) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The father-Torren memory crystallizes her moral inheritance without over-explaining. Final renunciation—offering evidence, not begging forgiveness—feels earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara accepts incremental absolution, foreclosing redemption but restoring temporal justice. The causal chain—council’s time fraud → Torren’s sabotage → wreck → Mara’s correction—is tight and paid off in the pendulum’s recalibration. Cost is legible in the widow’s nod and Mara’s “painful easing.” Drive lens is Causal, held from inciting incident through final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The obsidian ridge isn’t backdrop—it gnaws, heats, and receives the plumb bob’s recalibration. Tools (rake handle, pendulum bob) function as micro-settings that constrain choice: corrosion reveals a scratch, lead weight distorts time. Final wave meeting the notch charges closure with environmental precision. Sensory detail (salt-veined glass, green corrosion) filters through Mara’s professional attention.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—temporal integrity as communal survival—is signaled early and deepened when Mara discovers engineered drift. Her agency drives escalation: pausing the pendulum, decoding inscriptions, removing lead. Cost is unmistakable: she cannot undo deaths, only correct the clock, accepting partial justice. Pressure coheres under Causal lens—each action narrows options toward mechanical penance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through gear teeth and tide notches: truth as calibrated alignment, not moral purity. The final image—pendulum swinging, neither early nor late—offers non-literal answer to imbalance without sermonizing. Torren’s hidden instructions reweight “efficiency” as ethical betrayal. Complexity endures: absolution remains incremental, justice incomplete but necessary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exquisitely controlled: Mara notices brass polish, gear settings, lunar correlations. Syntax modulates with pressure—longer sentences for reflection, terse clauses during mechanical acts. No head-hopping; free indirect style merges her precision (“incremental absolution”) with lyrical ache (“shame turning like a key”). Voice remains consistent even in searing reverie, never slipping into diagnostic abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “black glass veined with salt and barnacle scar” does setting, character, and theme in one stroke. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances plot or deepens stakes. Figurative language is coherent (time as hot coal, guilt as hesitation) and peaks without muddle. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors pendulum swing—measured, inevitable, resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms clockwork tropes through tidal specificity and ethical mechanics. “Incremental absolution” feels fresh because it’s enacted via gear weights and lunar math, not metaphor alone. Risk-taking (lyric compression, technical detail) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The synthesis—timekeeping as communal covenant—feels inevitable in hindsight, anchored in rake-handle inscriptions and corroded brass.</comment>
