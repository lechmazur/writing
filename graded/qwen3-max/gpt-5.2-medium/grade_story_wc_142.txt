<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ira’s dual allegiance is embodied in micro-choices—smiling at investors while tagging warnings—that reveal her hierarchy of values under pressure. Her internal conflict operates simultaneously, not as alternating summaries, and culminates in a credible renunciation with visible cost: exhaustion after painting the final mural. The stone chip isn’t just a prop; it constrains her tactics and forces improvisation within tight spatial and temporal limits. No diagnostic label-speak mars her crisis; emotion stays tactile (“desperation sharpened her hope into a plan”).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Vell’s choice crystallizes options, and Ira’s final mural reconfigures meaning without resolving all tension. The quartz map enables a Decisive Change (rafts drifting apart) that invalidates deeds, fulfilling Majo’s logic. Cost is legible in Ira’s exhaustion and the implied fragility of the moratorium. Causality holds under a Hybrid lens—accumulative texture (graffiti code) meets causal pressure (security launch forcing action).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The raft city isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint and resource. Barges, pontoons, and theater floors shape movement, conceal graffiti, and enable overnight reorganization. The foundation stone chip functions as micro-setting: its quartz seams dictate tactical choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective (“lantern light,” “new engines like teeth”) and filtered through Ira’s professional attention, avoiding tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving Cadenza’s autonomy—is signaled early and tightens when privatizers arrive. Ira’s agency drives escalation: her graffiti system enables the reorganization that forces Vell’s hand. Cost is unmistakable: she risks her Council berth and endures exhaustion to protect her community. The single meaningful deepening—Old Majo’s stone revealing hidden seams—narrows options to covert action or surrender.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: fluidity vs. fixedness, coded in drifting rafts and quartz maps. The final mural—a stone heart cracking into boats—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to gentrification: freedom requires impermanence. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers (will the moratorium hold?), yet the cost of resistance is felt. Subtext thrives in silence—the unspoken pact between Ira and Vell carries more weight than any declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: rhythmic, maritime-inflected, and precise (“bobbed on the bay,” “steering barge-homes like swans”). Prose modulates under pressure—sentences shorten during the security launch (“she heard the new engines like teeth”). Focalization remains tightly controlled; even collective moments (“dancers hauling ropes”) are filtered through Ira’s perception. No head-hopping; Vell’s realization is rendered through observable action, not interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density: “culture shock absorber” conveys role, skill, and metaphor in three words. Syntax varies purposefully—longer cadences for carnival texture, staccato beats for urgency. One minor slip: “orderly intuitive” slightly abstracts, but immediately grounds in action (“slide bodies apart with a joke”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language (“engines like teeth”) clarifies rather than obscures.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise transforms gentrification tropes through specific world logic: privatization fails because the city refuses to be mapped. The graffiti code merges carnival aesthetics with resistance, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk—making bureaucracy negotiable through spatial fluidity—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Every element (stone chip, raft seams, swing-bridge confrontation) coheres into an authentic vision where culture is infrastructure.</comment>
