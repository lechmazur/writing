<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling, adaptive training, and fear-as-compass feel specific and contradictory without diagnostic label-speak. Her micro-choices (rubbing charcoal, showing tears) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The boy’s presence forces relational stakes that crystallize her transformation credibly. Final action—signing her real name—is earned by prior causality with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara shifts from hiding to being seen, foreclosing her old survival mode with tangible cost (exposure, vulnerability). The causal chain—file discovery → library decryption → confrontation—is tight, motivated, and escalates via protagonist agency. Orientation anchors (“stunt double,” “props vault,” “rusted library”) are clear by line 30 and serve closure. Cost is legible in the final image: signing her name while holding the child’s hand.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rusted library functions as micro-setting: iron shelves bleed dust, moonlight filters through cracks, and burnt scripts supply charcoal—all directly enabling the decryption. The seashell and cast become environmental extensions that constrain choice. Sensory detail is selective and crisis-narrowed (moths like “shredded film,” orange dust). Final image charges the setting: soundstage becomes courtroom because the library armed her.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming identity from erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the cipher reveals Mara listed as “asset.” Pressure tightens causally: each move (decryption, projection) narrows Vaughn’s control and raises personal risk. Protagonist agency drives escalation; coincidence never resolves. Cost is unmistakable: tears, trembling, public exposure—all paid before victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: vulnerability as power is tested via the shell’s whisper, the boy’s cast, and the crew’s turn—not stated but dramatized. Final image reweights the premise: being seen, not fearless, defeats exploitation. No moralizing; resonance arises from the seashell’s stitched confession and projected notes. Complexity is preserved—Vaughn isn’t redeemed, systems aren’t magically fixed—but agency is reclaimed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>First-person voice is distinct: syntax contracts under stress (“I fled… where iron shelves bled”), expands in reflection (“betrayal so complete it began transforming me”). Perceptual signature is consistent—Mara notices rigging terms, burnt paper, smudged ink—filtered through stunt work expertise. Elision is purposeful (backstory compressed into file discovery) and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance remains intimate and controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “moths skated through moonlight like shredded film” does atmosphere, character perception, and motif in one. Figurative language is pattern-taught (shells, film, erasure) and peaks coherently. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot, character, or texture. Final paragraph’s rhythm modulates perfectly—short clauses for tension, lyrical swell for triumph—without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms familiar tropes (stunt double, corporate conspiracy) through hyper-specific mechanics: decrypting notes on a cast with charcoal rubbings, seashell as audio archive. Risk-taking (lyric compression, embedded cipher) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular—fear as compass, vulnerability as weapon—and synthesizes seamlessly. Premise would collapse with generic substitutions; every element is irreplaceable.</comment>
