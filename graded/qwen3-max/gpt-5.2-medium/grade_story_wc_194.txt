<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Leander’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied silence, micro-choices (e.g., adjusting the horn’s angle), and a hierarchy of values that culminates in abdication as restitution. His contradiction—dynastic heir who refuses legacy yet honors truth—is active throughout, not summarized. The final renunciation forecloses rule with visible cost: surrendering power to rebuild what his line destroyed. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in dust ripples and weighted cranks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Leander’s abdication reframes dynasty not as inheritance but debt, with “build what we denied” as map. The Causal lens holds—each discovery (crank, wall, ledger) follows from intuition and action, not coincidence. Cost is legible in the balcony scene: silence becomes evidence, treasury redirected. Orientation is immediate (“House Ardent,” “last prince”), and the single scene tightens cleanly to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sepia reading room functions as micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: shelves yield the ledger, portraits conceal mechanisms, acoustics transmit truth. Sensory detail (powdery charcoal, golden shadows, hiss shifting to chord) is selective and pressure-driven. The gramophone crank and books are handled tactilely, not cataloged. Final image—returning the crank to the notch—charges closure by marking where rebuilding begins, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus dynastic legacy—is signaled early and deepens when Nara’s confession reweights abdication from gesture to moral imperative. Leander’s agency drives escalation: intuition guides crank use, horn adjustment, book selection. Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits rule and redirects crown wealth, crystallizing stance under coherent pressure. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his choices under the Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: betrayal of a bridge builder echoes in Leander’s restitution via bridge-building. Subtext thrives in silence, dust patterns, and mechanical voice—not moralizing. The ending reweights the dynasty’s origin myth without stating a thesis: “End us clean” becomes architectural mandate. Ambiguity lingers (Will the bridge be built?), but the conceptual cost—erasing lineage to restore justice—is undeniable and non-literal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Leander notices weight, sound, ash-patterns, not emotions or abstractions. Syntax modulates with pressure—longer sentences for musing, clipped focus during discovery. Voice remains consistent in elevated but precise diction (“eloquently silent gaze,” “standing waves”), fitting a scholarly prince. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained (no access to ministers’ thoughts). Elision (e.g., skipping how he knows about the notch) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“dust trembled… drawing pale ripples that mapped invisible pressure lines”) and rhythmic control. Figurative language is coherent (bridge of intuition, room as instrument) and peaks without muddle. Minor scaffold in “he opened… and his fingers closed” slightly dulls immediacy, but no loops or register drift. Final paragraph’s propulsion (“carried… presented… signed… ordered”) earns its cadence without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ingenuity lies in merging acoustic archaeology with dynastic reckoning—the gramophone as truth-retrieval device feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes (last heir, hidden ledger) are transformed by specificity: wax strips encoding speech, standing waves revealing patterns. Risk-taking (silent protagonist, abstract climax) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The synthesis of engineering, sound, and restitution offers a non-obvious moral calculus that feels singular.</comment>
