<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Jonas’s interiority is concrete and particular—his grief is embodied in limestone dust, ribbon-tying rituals, and chisel hesitations. His motivation (to map collective grief) intensifies credibly through spectral mentorship and family reconnection. The final act of setting the tablet enacts Earned Stasis: he forecloses private mourning for communal resonance, with visible cost in emotional labor and ritual exposure. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions (solitude vs. connection, craft vs. spirit) drive choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the finished tablet crystallizes shared pauses into public form, turning private grief into “one chord.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story builds density via ribbons, poems, butterfly waves—until the final braiding. Cost is legible: Jonas sacrifices solitary craft for vulnerable communion, paid in the greenhouse dinner and dawn placement. Orientation anchors instantly (“dusk,” “greenhouse,” “Jonas”), and causality flows through tactile beats without retroactive patches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: vines swallow benches but shelter living plants, making it the only place “echoes felt willing to answer.” Weather (thunder, rain) modulates perception and memory, while spatial choreography—potting table, cemetery gate, orchids—tracks Jonas’s arc. Final image charges the setting: dawn light on the tablet at the gate reweights the greenhouse’s liminal role. Sensory hierarchy reflects his profession: touch (limestone dust, chisel marks) dominates over visual spectacle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering the shape of collective grief—is signaled early and deepens when the spirit guides Jonas to braid separate losses. Agency is clear: his retracing, ribbon-tying, and carving narrow options from private inquiry to public memorial. Cost is felt in emotional exposure (hosting siblings, spectral vulnerability) and conceptual labor (decoding chisel pauses). Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under an Accumulative lens, though the spirit’s arrival leans slightly coincidental without undermining earned pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: grief isn’t abstract but lives in chisel hesitations, poem lines on ribbons, butterfly-weighted fabric. The ending offers a non-literal answer—interlocking arcs as a map of shared pauses—reweighting all prior images without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (communal hush between stones) and gesture (tying ribbons together). Complexity is preserved: collective grief requires both solitude (carving) and communion (dinner), with no tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is fiercely controlled—third-person limited filtered through Jonas’s meditative, craft-oriented perception. Voice modulates rhythm with emotional intensity: short clauses during thunder, lyrical flow during migration. Distinct perceptual signature: notices stone textures, sound cadences, familial poetic echoes. No head-hopping; even the spirit’s dialogue serves Jonas’s internal arc. Prose-as-character: syntax mirrors carving—deliberate, precise, with rhythmic breaths like chisel strikes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“orange wings drifted like embers,” “thundering calm”) and paid off in closure (butterflies lifting at dawn). Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary purposefully. Minor artifact: “fiercely meditative” repeats verbatim, but functions as leitmotif rather than scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence crystallizes the story’s emotional architecture without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms familiar tropes (ghost mentor, artisan protagonist) through specific, grounded choices: grief mapped via chisel hesitations, collective mourning enacted through poem-ribbons. Core premise—a carver seeking the geometry of shared sorrow—is non-obvious and fully committed. Risk-taking (spectral mentorship, butterfly symbolism) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision coheres: every element serves the central question, and the final image feels inevitable yet fresh. No derivative safety; specificity (Saint Lyris, limestone dust, mourning-color ribbons) anchors universals.</comment>
