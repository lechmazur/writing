<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “serene upheaval” and moral conflict between truth and comfort feel lived-in, not diagnostic. Her micro-choices (splicing the tape, using the sundial twice) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: stripping others of consoling myths. The final exchange with the bargeman deepens her stance without judgment, showing growth through restraint, not epiphany. Flaws like her complicity in myth-seeking are acknowledged but not hedged.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the canal folk see “the scaffolding behind their own prayers,” reweighting faith as engineered loyalty. Cost is legible in the “slow turning” and the mayor’s mapping of belief—a social price made undeniable. The Causal lens holds: each beat follows because/therefore (silence → legend → devotion → exposure). The tide chart/sundial verification tightens options plausibly, avoiding coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The twilight barge canal isn’t backdrop—it pressures every choice: water’s stillness mirrors enforced silence, stilted warehouses imply fragility, and the floating relay shack enables Mara’s infiltration. The pocket sundial functions as micro-setting, constraining her verification method and charging the final image where its shadow measures shifting truth. Sensory detail is selective (oilcloth-sealed tape, lavender light) and filtered through Mara’s myth-hunting expertise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. manufactured belief—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes exposing the lie strips comfort. The tightening occurs at the locker discovery: knowledge forces action with cost (eroding communal faith). Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency (instincts, splicing tape), not luck, and culminates in a trade-off: clarity over solace. Pressure remains coherent under the Causal lens until the Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from objects and actions: lies as architecture, truth as shifting sunlight. The final image—canal “talking in its own voice”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether communities can revise stories. No moralizing; complexity is preserved (Mara doesn’t undo harm, only restores choice). Subtext thrives in silence, salvage, and the bargeman’s admission, avoiding binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled single-third, with a perceptual signature that blends lyrical precision (“black and still beneath the stilted warehouses”) and professional focus (diver-like instinct training). Voice modulates under pressure—sentences shorten during infiltration but retain rhythmic control. No head-hopping; even the bargeman’s dialogue stays filtered through Mara’s listening. Diction remains within her plausible lexicon, avoiding register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “objects pulled from muck often carried the fingerprints of the stories that drowned them” does triple duty. Figurative language is pattern-taught (shadows confess, lies as bridge) and paid off. Minor redundancy in “thoughtfully clear” repetition (tape note + Mara’s speech) triggers a −0.1, but no loops or scaffold dull closure. Final line’s lyricism earns its weight without purple excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms myth-hunting tropes through specificity: the Flood Saint as political tool, salvage as evidentiary act. Original synthesis of surveillance (mayor mapping believers), media manipulation, and community complicity feels urgent and fresh. Risk-taking—quiet climax, no villain confrontation—heightens thematic stakes. Vision coheres fully; removing any core element (sundial, tape, canal) would fracture logic.</comment>
