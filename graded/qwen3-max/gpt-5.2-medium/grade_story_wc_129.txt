<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sava’s motivation—to graft herself onto community through craft, not pleading—is embodied in every choice, from offering reed signs to weaving the lattice. Her internal contradiction (longing for belonging vs. fear of rejection) manifests physically in her handling of stalks and silence. The final dedication is earned by prior causality: her reed spirals foreshadow the arbor’s living lattice. Cost is visible: she risks irrelevance, then earns inclusion through irreversible creation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the arbor becomes a communal node where kinship is crafted, not inherited. The loop-and-thorn’s revelation as an invitation—not a signature—reweights the entire search with conceptual cost: belonging requires active making. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; patterned details (reed impressions, crystal fruit, map-song) accumulate toward this reconfiguration. Every beat tightens around the central stake: who gets to belong?</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor aren’t backdrop—they constrain and enable. Crystal roots arch above crater glow, dictating search paths; volcanic glass preserves reed impressions, proving shared origin. Final image charges closure: woven reeds link obsidian to crystal trees, transforming geography into kinship infrastructure. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—Sava notices rain-on-stone smell before form, embodying her marsh-born perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—belonging through contribution—is signaled early and deepens when the tag’s true meaning emerges. Sava’s agency drives escalation: she initiates the search, leaves reed signs, interprets the kin map, and weaves the lattice. Cost is unmistakable: her loneliness has “an address,” and her dedication forecloses anonymity. The child’s prior death and winter’s return raise stakes without coincidence resolving them.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: kinship as craft, not birthright. The loop-and-thorn’s reinterpretation—from path marker to invitation—offers a non-literal answer to Sava’s ache. Final image reweights all prior material: reeds once deemed mortal now host winter tags, proving belonging is sustained through return. No moralizing; resonance arises from the lattice extending to “strangers and the child lost last season.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Sava sees reeds as temporal signs (“all signs were mortal”), hears Oren’s hum as coordinate, smells rain in obsidian. Voice modulates under pressure—prose tightens during the arbor discovery (“luminescent ache filling the arbor”). No head-hopping; even multi-character scenes stay anchored in Sava’s sensory field. Rhythmic control peaks in closure: short clauses (“They followed it to one another, not away”) crystallize Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear: “craterlight bled through obsidian like dim stars trapped under skin” merges image, emotion, and setting. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances plot or character. Figurative language is coherent—crystal “remembering names,” reeds as “mortal” signs—without muddle. Minor deduction: one slightly ornate phrase (“luminescent ache”) risks abstraction but pays off by charging the arbor’s atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: street art as kinship architecture, marsh craft meeting volcanic glass. Tropes (lonely outsider, hidden artist) transformed through specific logic—reed impressions in obsidian prove shared fen origins. Bold risk: resolution hinges on interpreting a symbol, not action, yet feels inevitable because every detail (reed spirals, council’s clipped phrases) scaffolds the reveal. Vision is singular: belonging as deliberate, fragile, renewable craft.</comment>
