<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation—salvaging purity from wreckage—is embodied in precise, tactile choices (warming the globe, aligning distortions) that reveal her hierarchy of values under pressure. Her internal contradiction (ghost whisperer who refuses to exploit spirits) manifests not as abstract angst but through disciplined action and sensory restraint. The final renunciation—leaving the globe as a “gentler window”—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; grief is rendered as breath in cold air, not therapy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara forecloses Fen’s exploitation by exposing him, then chooses stewardship over possession, crystallizing her stance with tangible cost (the child’s ghost thinned, her own labor unrewarded). The Causal lens holds: each beat links because/therefore (globe’s melt → heat underwater → Fen’s brazier → dream-harvesting → shared dreams → pier confrontation). Cost is legible in the final image—the teardrop globe “serving” others—and the shrine’s candles flickering as sleepers dream collectively. Orientation anchors firmly by line 3; no disorientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The glacier shrine isn’t backdrop but active constraint: its ice lens enables Mara’s vision of Fen’s crime, and candlelight “borrowed starlight” charges the final image. The melted snow globe functions as micro-setting—its physical state (collapsed glass, trapped water) dictates tactics (warming it, aligning distortions) and reconfigures meaning at closure as a “window of connection.” Sensory detail is selective and urgent: cold blue flames, silt-dark dives, ink-stained fingers—all filtered through Mara’s professional gaze. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography (altar-stone, alcoves, sea below) remains coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescuing purity from exploitation—tightens decisively when Mara confirms Fen skimmed spirits’ “last reflections,” thinning them to silence. This deepening forces her shift from salvage to exposure, narrowing options: she must weaponize the shrine’s “window” function against Fen’s own methods. Cost is unmistakable: the child’s ghost is already damaged, and Mara’s victory requires communal witness (fisherwoman, priest), risking public failure. Protagonist agency drives escalation—her analysis of dream cameos directly enables the trap—under a clear Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the snow globe’s transformation: from private childhood artifact to exploited resource to communal memorial. The ending offers a non-literal answer to “What is purity?”—not untouched innocence but rescued fragility held where light reaches it—reweighting all prior images (shells, nails, scratched names) as acts of remembrance versus consumption. Subtext operates in silence: ghosts press images, not words; Fen’s cruelty lies in stealing reflection, not summoning. No moralizing; resonance accrues through concrete particulars (silver grit, ink-stained fingers, unshuttered windows).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled single-third with Mara’s perceptual signature: professional wreck-diver noticing knots, copper wire, regulator breath; ghost whisperer sensing “trapped voices rise like breath.” Voice modulates under pressure—syntax tightens during the vision (“she saw the wreck again… Fen had entered it”), then expands lyrically at closure (“distorted little world could serve”). No head-hopping; even secondary characters’ dreams are filtered through Mara’s investigation. Diction stays within plausible lexicon (“cameo appearances,” “brazier,” “regulator”) without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere (“glass does not slump into itself in seawater unless someone has brought heat down where it does not belong”). Figurative language is purposeful—“breath in cold air,” “teardrop globe”—without muddle. Minor scaffold in “she had tracked rumors… she suspected…” could tighten, but no loops or synonym churn. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors thematic resolution: short clauses (“As guards took Fen…”) yielding to lyrical cadence (“purity was not untouched, only rescued…”).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fusion of maritime salvage, ghost lore, and dream economics—transforming tropes through specificity (Fen harvesting “last reflections” via steam, not souls). The “windows of connection” concept feels inevitable in hindsight: glacier lens, dream frames, snow globe all refract memory. Risk-taking (lyric compression, ghost-as-image-not-voice) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No template echoes; voice, setting, and moral calculus cohere as singular artistic stance.</comment>
