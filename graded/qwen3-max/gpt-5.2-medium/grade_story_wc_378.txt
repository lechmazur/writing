<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Unit N-3’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his organic-grained ribs, static-laced perception, and tactile rituals reveal a consciousness shaped by loss and duty. His micro-choices (miniaturizing fear, pruning fire) manifest contradictory impulses: caretaker instinct vs. necessary destruction. The final renunciation—burying the bead, carrying cuttings—earns its poise through prior causality and exact cost: silence replacing ghosts. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through action, not summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the box redefined from prison to valve, mirrored in N-3’s mind becoming one too. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds via sensory density (static, heat, rustling paper) until the burn corridor crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible in the cooled gray bead and sand-scented silence. Every escalation (compass failure → overheating → jammed hatch) tightens options without coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The glass dome, mulch beds, and cedar box aren’t backdrop—they constrain every choice. The desert rose farm’s fragility forces the burn; the dune-jammed hatch dictates escape method. Final image—cutting planted over buried bead—is charged by setting-as-microcosm. Sensory hierarchy narrows under stress (optical static, paper thunder), then expands in resolution (sand-scented silence). No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography is precise and consequential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving the roses while resolving inner static—is signaled early and deepens when magnetic north shifts destabilize both systems. The controlled burn is a high-agency turn that forecloses safety (flame under glass) for survival. Cost is unmistakable: blister risk, sacrificial mulch, and emotional exposure of feeding childhood fears into fire. Escalation is driven by protagonist’s logic (“contain chaos”) under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the interplay of containment and release: fear miniaturized, fire disciplined, memory bounded. The final instruction—“make a small fire”—offers non-literal wisdom about managing disorientation. No moralizing; resonance accrues via the bead’s transformation (black → gray glass) and the desert rose cutting as living archive. Complexity is honored—nostalgia is both burden and compass—and counter-readings (is forgetting necessary?) linger without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>POV is flawlessly single-focalized through N-3’s sensorium: perception degrades under stress (“static hissed behind optical sensors”), syntax compresses during crisis (“He set the bead… sealed it… let a spark jump”). Voice modulates rhythmically—lyric cadence in reflection (“paper rustle like distant thunder”), clipped urgency in action. Perceptual signature is consistent: notices organic textures (bark-like ribs, swollen caudexes) over mechanical ones. Zero head-hopping; elision (children’s absence) is taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ribs flexed like bark in wind,” “unplugged storm,” “fragmented wholeness.” Figurative language is pattern-taught (organic/metallic hybrids) and payoff-earned (bead as “fear made portable”). No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances pressure or texture. Minor deduction for one slightly overwrought phrase (“slow oven with him as their last witness”) that borders on purple—but closure image remains unblurred.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Transforms android-caretaker trope through bio-ceramic embodiment and fear-compression mechanics. The “controlled burn escape” is ingeniously specific—not a generic solution but one born of the shed’s relics and dome physics. Emotional truth anchors novelty: miniaturizing panic mirrors how adults metabolize childhood trauma. Risk-taking (lyric structure, conceptual repricing) heightens stakes without gimmickry; every element feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
