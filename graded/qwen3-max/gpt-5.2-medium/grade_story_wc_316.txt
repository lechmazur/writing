<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—numbness, clarity, and contradiction coexist without therapy-speak. Micro-choices (bowing to the clone, placing palm on the jar) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Motivation intensifies organically from survival to stewardship. The final renunciation of ownership feels earned by prior causality and emotional groundwork.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “custody of the moment” reweights identity, law, and selfhood with undeniable social cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through shifting constellations, legal claims, and breath until pressure crystallizes in shared respiration. History’s rewriting isn’t gimmick but active constraint shaping every turn. Cost is legible in the empty drum of the chest and the Council’s tears.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice—the edge where cloud begins forces the trial, gravity ropes imply fragile order, wind bells in two tones mirror duality. The ash sea and braided ropes aren’t backdrop but tactile stakes. Final image charges the setting: staves drawn into one circle on the mat reconfigures space as shared ground. Every detail serves pressure or closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—personhood amid erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the Custodians arrive with the jar. Protagonist agency drives escalation: not fighting but inviting, not dominating but surrendering. The deepening comes via complementary opposites, which reframe conflict itself. Cost is unmistakable: numbness cracking only after shared breath forces vulnerability on all parties.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action, not assertion: identity as ongoing custody, not fixed origin. The brain-in-jar and clone body become vessels for questioning continuity, but resolution rejects both legal and spiritual essentialism. Final charter naming “co guardians” offers non-literal answer—belonging through mutual attention, not ownership. Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and the shudder of the unanimated body.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV remains tightly controlled, with perceptual signature rooted in post-ego-death clarity (“sliced through pretense the way a blade parts fog”). Voice modulates under pressure—syntax shortens during confrontation but retains lyrical precision. No head-hopping; even Master Sora’s wisdom is filtered through protagonist’s sensory lens. Elision of backstory is purposeful and paid off in present stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “stone mats held in place by braided gravity ropes” does worldbuilding, texture, and metaphor in one stroke. Figurative language is patterned (fog, drum, breath) without muddle. Minor scaffold in “letting grief and gratitude balance, letting stillness and strike share one breath”—slight parallelism repetition—but earns its place thematically. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors shared breath, closing with cadence that supports meaning.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes cloning jurisprudence, ego death, and martial philosophy into something singular. Tropes (dojo, clones, lawyers) are transformed by specificity: Custodians as robed litigators, history rewriting constellations hourly. Risk-taking (rejecting dominance for surrender) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The charter’s co-guardianship feels inevitable in hindsight yet freshly imagined—a non-obvious resolution grounded in emotional and conceptual logic.</comment>
