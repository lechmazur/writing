<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lysa’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her grief, vocation, and empathy manifest through tactile choices (hovering palms, carving alder blocks) rather than exposition. Her “symphonically minded” trait isn’t labeled but enacted: she reads cracks as intervals, translates vibration into form. The final decision to leave the insulator behind crystallizes her renunciation of ownership in favor of communal resonance—a credible endurance with visible cost. No diagnostic phrasing or emotional summarizing mars her contradictions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lysa accepts that music now lives in touch, not sound, and leaves the insulator as a permanent bridge—foreclosing personal possession for shared access. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; pressure tightens via escalating wire-strung notes that deepen her understanding of strain-as-record. Cost is legible in the monument’s weathered faces and her solitary walk onward. Orientation is immediate (“wet path,” “siskin alder grove”) and never wavers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The siskin alder grove functions as micro-setting: alder bends without breaking (enabling wires), siskins hop along lines (transmitting vibration), moss buries the monument (marking time). Tools—porcelain insulator, copper wire, chisels—are handled with ritual specificity that constrains method. Final image charges the insulator as “pale moon,” transforming utility into symbol through accumulated tactile use. Every detail serves pressure or closure; no white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—making the unheard heard—is signaled early and deepens when Lysa realizes cracks are “records of pressure endured.” Her agency drives escalation: analyzing cracks → stringing wires → carving resonant blocks → leaving the insulator. Each act narrows options (she can’t undo the sculpture’s silence) and exacts cost (solitude, physical labor). Coincidence never resolves; birds and sap merely modulate tension she already created.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence isn’t absence but a medium for empathy. The final image—grove swaying in “inaudible chord”—reweights all prior strain as meaningful communication. No moralizing; insight arises from Lysa pressing alder to stone and feeling tremor travel. Subtext thrives in what’s withheld: neighbors avoid eye contact, yet porcelain bridges may teach them “the weight of another life.” Ambiguity lingers (will they touch it?), but resonance is undeniable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: Lysa notices stress patterns like musical scores, feels pulse in wire, hears through bone. Syntax mirrors her focus—long, lyrical sentences for observation; short, taut phrases for action (“She sets… She lashes… She plucks”). No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained (she doesn’t know neighbors’ thoughts, only their avoidance). Voice remains consistent even in reflection, which is anchored to present stimuli (monument’s cracks).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “wire quivers under her fingers like a held breath” does triple duty (image, sensation, metaphor). Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is coherent (music/silence lexicon sustained) and never muddled. Final line—“quiet maker of meetings between bodies that cannot yet sing”—resonates without overstatement. Minor deduction for one slightly ornate phrase (“stubborn need to create music”), but no artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Premise transforms post-apocalyptic silence into tactile symphony with stunning specificity: porcelain insulators as lightning guards repurposed for vibration conduction, siskins as “moving rests.” No tropes recycled; every choice feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking (silent music, empathy via wire) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision is singular—Lysa’s vocation merges craft, grief, and community in a way that couldn’t be transplanted elsewhere.</comment>
