<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lysa’s motivation—rooted in her father’s erasure and her mother’s wildflowers—is embodied through micro-choices (brewing coffee, chipping mortar, carrying jars) that escalate under pressure. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; grief manifests as tactile hunger (“scent hit my chest like a remembered lullaby”). The final renunciation isn’t of memory but of silence: she reclaims sorrow as lived truth. Her lantern-lighter identity informs every action without exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lysa restores memory, not to reverse loss but to endure it consciously—her father speaks her name, but the harbor remains quiet, now “gleaming with lived-in sorrow.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density (coffee grounds, salt crystals, whale rot) builds until the spiral pattern resolves into release. Cost is legible in the crumbling flower and the parasite’s stirring—grief returned exacts emotional weight. Every beat tightens around the central question: where do deleted memories go?</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber isn’t backdrop—it constrains choice (gravity shifts, floating tools) and supplies the archive’s physical logic. Wildflowers, lanterns, and coffee grounds function as micro-settings that charge closure: the pressed blooms stay intact only after memories are restored. Sensory hierarchy reflects crisis—Lysa notices mortar texture, brine taste, flame direction—never tourist detail. The whale carcass evolves from rotting mass to “ordinary weight,” mirroring thematic shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving identity against state-sanctioned forgetting—tightens when Lysa chooses rebellion over mercy. Agency drives escalation: reading grounds → entering chamber → breaking seal → returning grief. Each act narrows options (defying council, risking gravity shifts) and deepens cost (her father’s emptiness becomes communal peril). The parasite’s hunger makes stakes visceral: deletion isn’t relief but slow dehumanization. Final turn—speaking memories aloud—directly reverses the whale’s hold through earned action, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: memory as fragile yet necessary burden, not abstract “grief.” The pressed wildflower—first vanishing, then enduring—reweights closure without moralizing. Council’s “mercy” is critiqued via salt-jar archive: sorrow commodified to pacify a parasite. Final image (“silence gleamed with lived-in sorrow”) offers non-literal answer: wholeness requires holding pain, not deleting it. No false balance—parasite logic is exposed as cowardice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lysa’s perceptual signature—lantern-lighter precision fused with Maru’s folk wisdom—shapes diction (“gleaming silence,” “dark maps” in coffee). Syntax modulates under pressure: short clauses during mortar-chipping (“I chipped away… gravity shifted”), lyrical flow in reflection. No head-hopping; even Maru’s presence stays filtered through Lysa’s reverence. Voice remains consistent in elevated moments (“silence shone so hard it felt like a blade”) because lexicon aligns with her poetic trade.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density: “sweet rot draws gulls and forgetfulness” links ecology and emotion in six words. Figurative language is coherent—gravity “pockets,” memories as “dark maps”—with no mixed metaphors. Rhythm varies purposefully: staccato during spade work, flowing cadence in dawn beach walk. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances plot or atmosphere. Final line’s “wildflowers stayed pressed without vanishing” crystallizes theme without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise transforms amnesia tropes via specific mechanics: gravity pockets, salt-preserved grief, deep-sea parasite feeding on sorrow. Emotional truth anchors ingenuity—Lysa’s quest isn’t for cure but witness. Risk-taking (lyric structure, conceptual parasite) heightens stakes without gimmickry; the saltworks’ floating tools make physics serve theme. No derivative echoes; every element (coffee divination, lantern moths) feels organically rooted in this world’s logic.</comment>
