<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mina’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her trauma manifests through somatic markers, not therapy-speak, and her micro-choices (asking the teen to land the drone, unfolding the photo) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her motivation—to anchor optimism in realism—is dramatized through action, not declaration. The final renunciation isn’t escape but endurance: returning daily to grow “in public,” with visible cost in her tightened throat and wet palms. No diagnostic labeling; even “pearl of stillness” is earned through sensory ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mina refuses to flee the cliff, instead building windbreaks and labeling saplings with dates “not wishes.” The cost is legible—her body’s panic response—and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: pressure builds via sensory density (buzzing → gull wings) and cadence shifts toward measured calm. The lighthouse’s darkened state and arboretum’s salt-wind setting aren’t backdrop but arithmetic shaping her stance. Every beat tightens around the core tension: can something grow while remembering?</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The seaside cliff arboretum constrains every choice: salt wind dictates sapling selection, the glass pavilion houses the lens that enables Mina’s “pearl of stillness,” and the drone’s buzzing violates the space’s sanctity. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—copper taste, wet palms during panic; gravel paths, reed mats during calm. The setting evolves: fog rolls in as she labels plants, merging past (dark lighthouse) and future (dated saplings). Final image charges closure: realism includes mistaking gulls for drones, yet choosing to stay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—growing amid irreversible loss—is signaled early and deepened when the drone triggers Mina’s freeze. Her agency shines in the turn: she names the harm (“some sounds were not neutral”) and co-designs shelter with Dr. Harlow. The tightening forecloses avoidance; she must engage publicly with trauma. Cost is unmistakable: bodily panic, the crumpled photo’s creases like “ruined streets,” and the waterproof box burial marking absence without illusion. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sensory layer reweights survival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: trees needing stakes mirror Mina’s need for structure; labeling with dates (not wishes) rejects false hope. Subtext lives in gesture—the photo tucked at the cypress base, tracing Samir’s ring hand—and silence when she freezes. The ending offers a non-literal answer: realism isn’t denial but tending life while naming loss, measured in dated plantings. No moralizing; resonance accrues via the lens’s light pooling “as if the building still remembered its job”—a metaphor earned by the keeper’s death and Mina’s return.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled single-third, with a perceptual signature attuned to botanical and traumatic detail (“salt wind braided through pines,” “crease lines looked like maps of ruined streets”). Syntax modulates under stress: short clauses during panic (“palms wet, knees soft”), lyrical flow in stillness. Diction stays within Mina’s plausible lexicon—no academic drift—and the voice remains consistent even in translation scenes. Elision is purposeful: backstory compressed into the photo’s folds, paid off when she names Samir aloud.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances character, setting, or conflict (“she carried a crumpled photograph... folded so many times the crease lines looked like maps of ruined streets”). Figurative language is coherent—“pearl of stillness,” “braided” wind—and never muddled. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with emotional shifts. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; even high-pressure beats avoid filter-verb stacks. Final line (“to translate, to breathe, and to keep growing in public”) crystallizes theme without summary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms war trauma tropes through specificity: a wedding drone strike survivor working in an arboretum where erosion and growth coexist. The “pearl of stillness” reframes healing as hard-won pause, not resolution. Risk-taking heightens stakes—using botany as metaphor without didacticism—and the lighthouse lens as memory vessel feels inevitable in hindsight. No quirky ornament; freshness arises from Mina’s quiet competence and the cliff’s “clear arithmetic.” Vision coheres: realism as active practice, not passive endurance.</comment>
