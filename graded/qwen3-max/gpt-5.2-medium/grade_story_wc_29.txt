<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her “cautiously hopeful grin she did not quite trust” sets up a tension between belief and skepticism that culminates in her subsonic gambit. Her micro-choices (rewiring the transmitter, tracing charts) reveal a hierarchy of values: protecting the town from cosmic manipulation over institutional loyalty. The cost is visible in her isolation and grit-under-nails physicality, and her final act of handing over recordings shows earned agency without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara crystallizes the stakes—not contact vs. fear but who weaponizes wonder—and imposes a temporary shield while ceding decision to the town. The causal chain is tight: human argument shifts the beacon → Mara infers tricksters → she crafts a counter-signal → the sky hesitates, the crowd softens. Cost is legible in her exhaustion, locked door, and surrender of control; the persistent constraint (subsonic interference) shapes both tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The university radio station functions as a charged micro-setting: its glass-and-rust bunker under the observatory dome merges scientific and broadcast infrastructure, enabling Mara’s unique role. Tools (charts, tone generator, spectrum analyzer) constrain and enable choices—she physically traces lines to align celestial and social fault lines. The final image of candlelight vs. rally across the street uses spatial choreography to mirror internal and cosmic tensions, making setting inseparable from theme and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—control over interpretation of cosmic signals—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: Mara’s subsonic reply directly counters external pressures (manager, physics chair). The tightening occurs when the beacon shifts with human quarrels, forcing her to act before factions fracture further. Cost is unmistakable: she risks professional ruin, personal safety, and potential cosmic retaliation, yet chooses interference over silence or compliance, reweighting all options in the final standoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: wonder as a contested resource, not a neutral discovery. The story avoids moralizing by dramatizing how meaning is weaponized—Votaries demand broadcast, Quiet demand silence, tricksters exploit division. Mara’s subsonic shield reframes contact as stewardship, not ownership. The final image—shouting softening into “wary listening”—offers a non-literal answer: true contact begins not with transmission but with mutual recognition of the other’s reality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled single-third with a distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices inked ephemerides, grit under nails, spectral lattices—details filtered through her hybrid astronomer-engineer lens. Voice modulates under pressure: lyrical (“braided sound to starlight”) gives way to technical precision (“subsonic frequencies,” “triangulation”) without register drift. No head-hopping; even off-page factions are rendered through Mara’s sensory experience (shouting outside, pounding on the door).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere (“hands steady despite the grit under her nails”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“cosmic tricksters,” “false map”) and paid off in the spectral lattice bloom. Minor deduction for one slightly overloaded sentence (“Mara had read old logs… cosmic tricksters”) that briefly stalls momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Final line’s “keep broadcasting her subsonic shield” ties mechanics to metaphor flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of SETI tropes with Cold War shortwave paranoia and campus politics. The “cosmic tricksters” concept transforms invasion narratives into epistemological warfare—contact as baited meaning. Risk-taking (subsonic counter-signal, refusal to pick sides) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors universals: inked charts, denim-jacket campaign buttons, 2:13 a.m. timing. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight yet wholly original in execution.</comment>
