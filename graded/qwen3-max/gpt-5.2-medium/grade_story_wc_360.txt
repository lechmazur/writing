<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kestrel’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her borrowed selves crowd like misregistered prints, and her emotional arithmetic feels both idiosyncratic and psychologically precise. Her final renunciation (pouring all borrowed personalities into the blank broadside) is earned by escalating disorientation and coherent with her flaw: empathy as transposition, not absorption. The cost—loss of self-coherence—is felt in every tightening beat, culminating in a quiet return to center that forecloses her old method. No diagnostic label-speak; even “transposed empathy” is dramatized through pulse-swapping and vellum-breath.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the blank broadside reweights the story’s core equation into communal resonance, with visible cost—Kestrel’s near-erasure of self. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds via patterned vanishings, star-blinks, and personality accrual until the final sheet inverts the dynamic. Orientation is immediate (“topaz workshop,” “lead type by starlight”), and the courier’s silent delivery teaches deliberate ambiguity early. Cost is legible in the cooling press and ledger symbols—gratitude, regret, love as ratios, not poems.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The topaz workshop functions as micro-setting: its dust turns honey-gold from the halo fragment, constraining perception and charging the final image. Tools (press, chase, forme) are tactile extensions of Kestrel’s cognition—she locks the fragment beside ordinary letters “trusting any metal could be taught to speak.” Star vanishings aren’t backdrop but active temporal pressure that tightens decisions (“between the vanishings”). Sensory hierarchy reflects her profession: ink weight, paper breath, hum of reentry—all filtered through a letterpress operator’s urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mastering emotion’s arithmetic through printing—tightens when each transfer costs coherence, forcing Kestrel toward the final renunciation. Agency drives escalation: she experiments with riddles, pastes posters that drain auditors’ anger, and ultimately chooses self-emptying. The cost—multiplying borrowed selves until she’s “a stone in deep water”—is unmistakable and shapes the climax. Coincidence (courier’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the vector’s power is unlocked only through her iterative choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the press: empathy as transformation, not gift, crystallizes in the ledger’s new symbols—ratios, not poems. The blank broadside offers non-literal resolution: townspeople’s sorrows align not through explanation but resonant ambiguity, reweighting every prior print as failed approximation. No moralizing; the equation E(x,y)=S(x)−S(y) evolves from cryptic stamp to lived truth. Final image—the cooling press and aligned sorrows—invites reflection without closure, embracing complexity (empathy requires loss) without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is inseparable from Kestrel’s trade: syntax mirrors typesetting (“misregistered prints,” “deliberate ambiguity of arcs”), and diction blends craft precision (“chase,” “forme”) with lyrical compression (“sky forgot whole constellations”). POV remains tightly focalized; even borrowed personalities are filtered through her disorientation. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during star-blinks, flowing cadence in experimentation—and the prose never slips into exposition or head-hopping. Every sentence feels forged, not written.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density: “vellum washed with her own breath” conveys method, intimacy, and stakes in five words. Figurative language is consistent (printing metaphors for cognition) and payoff-driven—the “deliberate ambiguity” headline manifests physically in the final blank sheet. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“She was…”, “On the night…”, “When she unwrapped…”). Closure beat (“wrote in her ledger new symbols…”) avoids overwriting, letting the conceptual repricing resonate through concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesizing letterpress mechanics with emotional physics—halo fragments as sorts, empathy as transposition via matrix logic. Tropes (vanishing stars, cryptic artisans) are grounded in specific craft details (topaz dust, lead type) and moral calculus (each transfer costs coherence). The risk—lyric abstraction fused with mathematical conceit—heightens stakes without gimmickry; the blank broadside’s power feels inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes; this vision is singular, cohesive, and irreplaceable.</comment>
