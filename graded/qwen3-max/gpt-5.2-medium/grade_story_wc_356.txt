<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Jun’s ambition, sensory acuity, and reflective practice form a coherent interiority that drives every choice. Her final renunciation of extraction for reciprocity is earned through embodied struggle—especially during the bloom’s reek—and carries visible cost: she trades ownership for stewardship. The scentkeeper Etsu functions as pressure, not plot device, and Jun’s micro-choices (breathing with the branch, journaling in stench) reveal a hierarchy of values. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through fern-scent detection amid decay.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: serenity redefined as “riding motion,” not escaping it, crystallized when Jun draws the spiral meaning both stink and grace. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—wisdom accrues through repeated small motions (doodling, breathing, watching)—and intensifies at the bloom with cadence shift from trade to witness. Cost is legible: she forfeits immediate possession, accepts delayed reciprocity, and internalizes Larkroot’s ecology. Orientation is swift and poetic but never unclear; the tide’s turning anchors time, place, and stakes by line three.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Larkroot isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint and compass. Rope bridges sway, living branches hold weight, compost shrine dictates ritual; Jun moves *with* treetop sway, not against it. The corpse flower’s stench physically buckles her knees, yet she breathes through it—environment directly shapes tactic. Final image charges the seed-wrapping paper inward, linking mudflat origin to canopy wisdom. Sensory hierarchy (olfactory dominance) reflects Jun’s profession and filters all perception without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access to serenity-as-medicine—tightens when wardens refuse, then deepens into ethical test: observe without taking. Jun’s agency drives escalation: she maps scent currents, stands watch, journals truth. Cost is felt: endurance in putrid air, surrender of control, acceptance of delayed return. The bloom isn’t coincidence—it’s calendared ritual, and her success hinges on attention, not luck. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each quiet act (doodling, breathing) compounds toward Charged Poise at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through particulars: decay as compass, doodles as memory-airing, stink as necessary ceremony. No moralizing—the insight “serenity is not absence of motion but a way to ride it” arises from moth-tracked fern-scent amid rot. Final spiral drawing reweights every prior motif: wrapping paper, odor currents, tides. Ambiguity lingers (will the seed thrive in mudflats?), but the conceptual cost is undeniable: wisdom flows only through reciprocity, not extraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is immaculate: Jun notices scent signatures before faces, maps via odor spirals, journals on parcel interiors. Syntax modulates with pressure—long lyrical flows for ascent, tight clauses during bloom’s assault (“knees wanted to buckle, but she breathed”). No head-hopping; Etsu’s dialogue is sparse, goal-driven (“why want a flower famous for stench?”), and distinct. Voice remains consistent even in extremis: no register drift, no therapy-speak, just mint-dried precision meeting grave-pear reek.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the sea wind paused as if listening to itself” establishes voice and stakes in one breath. Figurative language is pattern-taught (spirals = odor currents = stink/grace) and pays off at closure. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Minor deduction only because “wildflower hush” slightly risks abstraction—but it’s grounded by leaf-holding action and returned as emotional register at descent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms herbalist quest trope through ecological ethics: medicine requires participation in decay, not domination. Corpse flower’s real-world carrion-moth symbiosis is woven into cultural ritual without exposition. Ambition-to-service arc avoids redemption cliché by making cost ongoing (she must send back pages). Risk-taking in lyric density pays off: “turning of the tide’s thought” isn’t vagueness but precise temporal/ecological hinge that tightens decisions. Vision feels singular, not stitched.</comment>
