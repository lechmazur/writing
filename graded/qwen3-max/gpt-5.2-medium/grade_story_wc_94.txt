<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interior contradiction—anger and gratitude toward the father—is embodied through tactile memory (the timetable, the plates) and crystallizes in a “furiously tranquil” emotional state that mirrors Lysa’s. His micro-choices (loading plates, timing breaths) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over safety, measured light over loud protest. The father’s backstory is not exposition but a charged revelation that reconfigures motive without absolving it. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion stays grounded in sensory detail and ritual action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: censorship is reframed not as erasure but as timed absence, with scars as durations. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds through repeated exposures, each deepening the thematic weight—and holds coherently to the end. Cost is legible in the half-caught star, the empty timetable, and the protagonist’s renunciation of direct confrontation. Every beat tightens around the central metaphor without causal breaks or orientation drift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory functions as both macro-setting and micro-setting: its suspended architecture, wet domes, and darkroom tools directly constrain choices (timing exposures, listening for rarefied air). The body becomes setting too—breath, pulse, and vision guide the ritual. Weather isn’t backdrop but active pressure: thunder rolls “under us,” lightning reveals mask seams, dawn scrubs the sky raw. Final image charges the setting: the observatory “remembers our pause each time a shutter clicked.”</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—naming the unnamed—intensifies through the ritual of timed exposures, each narrowing options to a single breath-stuttered instant. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to participate, to reframe his poems as plates, to carry absence as atlas. Cost is visible in the unfinished star-image and emotionally crystallized in his mixed fury/gratitude. The “vigil in pause” isn’t passive—it’s an active refusal to let scars be flattened into lines.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through image and action: scars as durations, censorship as timed absence, truth as silver salts held mid-bloom. No moralizing; the final atlas of absences reweights every prior poem without stating a thesis. Subtext thrives in silence (the extinguished safelight), gesture (Lysa’s uncostumed face), and object (the returned empty timetable). The central question—how to name what power refuses to name—is answered not with speech but with “measured light.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is exquisitely calibrated: lyrical but precise, poetic yet embodied (“second hand crawl like an insect along a rim of light”). Perceptual signature is consistent—a censored poet notices gaps, halftones, seams, pauses. Syntax modulates under pressure: shorter clauses during exposure, fluid cadence in reflection. No head-hopping; even Lysa’s dialogue serves the narrator’s focalization. Elision is taught early (ink-barred stanzas) and paid off in the photographic metaphor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (pearls, wounds, maps) and never muddled; metaphors cohere within the photographic/scarring lexicon. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Final line—“storm-kissed wonder that could not be neatly blacked out”—resonates without summarizing. Minor deduction only for one slightly ornate phrase (“domes wet as black pearls”), but it earns its place by establishing tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms censorship tropes through a fresh synthesis: poetry as undeveloped photograph, trauma as timed exposure, vigilance as paused process. The observatory-as-archive and bus timetable-as-conduit feel specific, not generic. Risk-taking (lyric structure, conceptual reframing) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Originality lies in making absence measurable—and thus undeniable—through scientific ritual fused with poetic grief.</comment>
