<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lamplighter’s interiority is vividly embodied—his vow to “discover the color of sound” manifests through sensory perception, not abstraction. His micro-choices (descending the ladder, speaking the vow aloud) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: sacrificing air and safety for revelation. The contradiction between “honesty as a screen” and his yearning for truth-turned-lens feels earned, not diagnostic. Final renunciation (“lighting lamps so others could find their own colors”) forecloses solitude with quiet poise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: sound’s color becomes legible through relinquished control, reweighting the entire premise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via synesthetic imagery until the violet bell “blooms like dawn,” crystallizing meaning. Cost is visible: air depletion, isolation, and the irreversible shift from hiding to witnessing. Every beat flows from the key tag’s discovery to the glowing card’s activation without causal rupture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The sunken library functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: silt-furred shelves limit movement, broken decks dictate access, and emergency lanterns’ failure necessitates the protagonist’s own lamp-path. Sensory detail is purposefully filtered—gold for muffled shouts, violet for bells—mirroring internal stakes without overt symbolism. The porthole frames both ascent (lanterns) and descent (sound-color), charging the final image. Environment directly enables the climax: without the submerged archive, the vow couldn’t be spoken or witnessed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering sound’s color—is signaled early and deepens when the Meridian’s library reframes it as an act of listening, not acquisition. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to descend, insert the tag, speak the vow. Cost is unmistakable—depleting air while festival cheers fade—and tightens options: he can’t stay, yet carries the covenant forward. The “meteor hush” isn’t passive backdrop; it’s the pressure chamber forcing stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: honesty as shield vs. lens, sound as color, light as both concealment and revelation. The ending offers a non-literal answer—truth isn’t spoken but *seen* through relinquished grasping—reweighting every prior image (lamps, lanterns, ink). No moralizing; resonance accrues via the glowing card pressed to chest, then pocketed as private covenant. Complexity endures: he still hides, but now to enable others’ discovery—a morally ambiguous, human resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exquisitely consistent: synesthetic filtering (“notes brushed my eyes with pale green”), tactile verbs (“snagged,” “furred,” “glimmered”), and rhythmic cadence that breathes with submersion. Voice modulates under pressure—sentences shorten during descent, expand in wonder at the library. No head-hopping; first-person interiority never overreaches knowledge. Elision is purposeful: backstory on the Meridian appears only as physical trace (registry, tag), never exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose maintains high information density without clutter: “stitched with small moons,” “curtains waved like tired flags,” “applause poured down as silver rain.” Figurative language is coherent—light consistently threads lamps, lanterns, ink, and perception. Minor density in mid-section (“shelves furred with silt, books swollen but intact in glass cases”) slightly slows momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s propulsion (“pocketed the tag… keep walking my pier”) earns its lyricism through concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synesthesia premise is transformed through maritime specificity: not abstract color-hearing, but sound-color revealed in a drowned hotel’s library during a lantern festival. Risk-taking heightens stakes—the entire quest hinges on a found tag and underwater vow—yet remains grounded in the lamplighter’s profession and longing. No template echoes; the “luminous vows” feel freshly minted, and the closure’s covenant avoids redemption tropes. Vision coheres: every image serves the central question of perception-through-surrender.</comment>
