<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her grief, vocation, and quiet desperation fuse in micro-choices like braiding hair or thumb-circling Orin’s hand. Her motivation (“capture one last spark”) emerges from consistent traits without diagnostic self-awareness. The final renunciation—releasing the spark into the sky—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. No stock phrasing; every gesture reveals hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mara accepts that attention, not rescue, is the gift, crystallizing her stance with tangible cost—the emerald chip now “heavier with borrowed light.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: static patterns deepen into lullaby, aurora shifts from map to cradle. Orientation anchors instantly (“skyborne grotto… Mara arrived alone”), and the stone bier’s payoff ties back to Orin’s request. Cost is legible in the sigh-of-light image and emptied hands at descent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto isn’t backdrop—it actively enables the ritual: aurora’s whisper meets planetary silence, allowing static to clarify. The emerald chip, Orin’s bier, and Mara’s tools function as micro-settings that constrain choice (e.g., placing chip on tongue to “scatter quiet light”). Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara’s profession—tactile focus on hair, skin, cold stone—while aurora’s visual dominance mirrors thematic weight. Final image of green thread infusing sky reweights all prior spatial logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving the “last spark” before oblivion—tightens when Orin’s lucid watchfulness proves temporary, forcing Mara to choose between hoarding or releasing the captured light. Her agency drives escalation: reading static, counting crackles, tucking memories into brightness. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits any illusion of retrieval, accepting only farewell. Under Accumulative lens, pressure crescendos via sensory density (crackle → corridor → sigh of light) until stance crystallizes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: mortician’s craft meets metaphysical threshold, yielding insight that “attention can keep the crossing from being cruel.” No moralizing—the epiphany lives in action (infusing spark into sky) and image (chip’s warmth, closed curtain). Central question—how to honor dying dignity—receives non-literal answer via radiant hush and lullaby static. Ambiguity lingers (what happens to sparks in sky?), but resonance is undeniable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: Mara notices suture concealment, rouge spills, static patterns—details filtered through beautician-mortician duality. Rhythmic control modulates with pressure: short clauses during crackle-counting (“she tucked a memory… another…”) versus lyrical flow in aurora descriptions. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained (she “learned to read” static, doesn’t claim omniscience). Voice remains consistent even in peak stress—no register drift or filter-verb stacks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density: “boots whispering on frost-slick stone” establishes sound, texture, movement in five words. Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors cohere (aurora as net, static as radio snow, spark as heartbeat). Sentence openings vary (“She was…”, “In her satchel…”, “Holding Orin’s…”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Only hairline slip: “lucidly watchful” slightly abstract, but immediately grounded in “closed lids were only a courtesy.”</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise transforms tropes: mortician as spiritual technician, aurora as conduit, static as soul-mapping tool—all feel inevitable yet fresh. Specificity abounds: emerald from saint’s ring, balm/thread for corpses, crackle intervals as memory vessels. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure, conceptual threshold) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final synthesis—spark released as gift to dark—feels both surprising and deeply earned by every prior beat.</comment>
