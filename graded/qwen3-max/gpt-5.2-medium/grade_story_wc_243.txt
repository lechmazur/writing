<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied contradiction—her euphoria and guilt over Jun’s erasure feel simultaneous, not sequential. Her “gently thorough” trait drives every micro-choice: prying the locket free, steeping parchment, tearing out the lie. The final act of inserting a receipt-sized list of ordinary losses crystallizes her moral arc with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in walnut-stained hands and jam-stained grins.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the covenant’s renewal gains legitimacy only by admitting culpability, reweighting “regenerated” from PR to reckoning. The causal chain—locket discovery → archival revision → public confrontation → sea’s hush—narrows options at each turn. Cost is legible in the mayor’s shaking hand and the torn page carried off by wind. Orientation anchors instantly (“blooming jetty at twilight”), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds via escalating sensory density (reeds hiss → walnuts scent → tide’s celebratory hush).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The blooming jetty functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its planks pulse with “living record,” barnacles hide evidence, and spatial choreography (steep path up, lantern light) guides action. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara’s archivist priorities—tannin smells, paper-hiss reeds, riverbed-dark ink. Final image ties environment to theme: sea smells of “walnuts and wet paper,” merging natural and archival textures. Every detail serves pressure or closure; no white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. civic erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes the new covenant repeats old lies. Her agency drives escalation: she rewrites the preface, confronts officials, inserts Jun as witness. Cost is unmistakable—the town’s rehearsed lies collapse, forcing public accountability. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via sensory and moral density, not plot reversals, culminating in the tide’s “celebratory hush” that validates her stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: history as “weight of small moments” reframes heroism into cracked teacups and jam-stained grins. The locket photo’s return reweights prior material—Jun shifts from accident to witness—without moralizing. Final image offers resonant answer: covenant’s power lies in precise, ordinary entries, making mercy contingent on honesty. Subtext thrives in silence (Jun’s mother dropping locket like a seed) and avoids binaries; the council’s bargains are named but not cartoonishly vilified.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Mara notices archival textures (walnut broth, tannins) and bureaucratic language (“proximate causes”). Rhythmic control under pressure shines in short, declarative clauses during climax (“She spoke… including the confession”) contrasting lyrical openings. No head-hopping; single POV remains stable even amid crowd scenes. Voice modulates organically—gentle thoroughness persists even when confronting power, avoiding ventriloquism or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density: “reeds hiss like paper” merges sound and profession; “tidal hush” conveys communal awe without exposition. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence structures vary purposefully (fragments for tension, complex syntax for reflection). Figurative language is coherent—walnut ink = riverbeds = sea’s memory—and never muddles causality. Final line’s “planks pulse… rewritten when context changes” ties motif to theme with surgical precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms archival tropes through specificity: walnut-ink rituals, receipt-sized truth-telling, and “proximate causes” as bureaucratic evasion. The “regenerated covenant” frame feels fresh—a civic ritual charged with ghostly accountability. Risk-taking (quiet climax, non-heroic protagonist) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth overrides novelty; Mara’s guilt over complicity in erasure feels urgently contemporary yet timeless.</comment>
