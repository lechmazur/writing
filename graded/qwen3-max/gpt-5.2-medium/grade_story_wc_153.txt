<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—pride, regret, and yearning coexist in tactile detail (“pressed to her ribs,” “scraped palms”). Her micro-choices (tearing letters, pressing shard to palm) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The brother’s late arrival avoids head-hopping while deepening relational stakes credibly. Final apology feels earned by prior causality, not sentiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the choice is made, the unsent state transcended, with emotional cost legible in healed shard and mingled breath. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the mangrove spirits’ condensation script, moonlight healing, and looping motifs tighten pressure without causal breaks. Orientation anchors instantly (“space where an apology waits unspoken”), and the stilt house setting evolves coherently. Final image reconfigures the premise: unsent ≠ cowardice but preparation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth functions as micro-setting: roots “clasped ankles like questions,” air “hummed with names,” directly pressuring Mara’s vulnerability. The gargoyle shard and condensation window constrain choices—she must summon memory through object and place. Final image (breath on glass, fading script) charges closure with irreplaceable specificity. Every sensory detail serves tension or theme; no white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming the pre-apology moment—is signaled early and deepens when spirits warn “DO NOT CHOOSE YET.” Mara’s agency drives escalation: she evokes the memory, tears old letters, writes new unsealed ones. Cost is unmistakable: blood from palm, three nights of exposure, emotional risk of brother’s return. Coincidence (Elias arriving) complicates but doesn’t resolve—Mara’s choice precedes his skiff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: unsent letters, healing stone, condensation script—all interrogate timing, courage, and the weight of words. Final non-literal answer: apology isn’t about rewriting the past but inhabiting the hinge where choice lives. No moralizing; resonance accrues via image (“fierce tenderness,” “edge now smooth”). Complexity preserved—Mara’s flaw (pride) isn’t erased, but integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Mara notices through texture (wax, salt film, black stone), sound (singing spirits, rain-as-footsteps), and silence. Syntax modulates under pressure—shorter phrases during evocation (“rain, footsteps, brother’s face turning away”). No head-hopping; Elias’s POV remains external until shared breath at window. Voice remains lyric yet precise, never slipping into abstraction or diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “roots clasped ankles like questions,” “looping words that vanished as soon as she tried to blink them into certainty.” Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language is coherent (stone as tongue, letters as proof). Minor deduction for slight over-compression in spirit-song description, but no artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: medium tropes transformed via mangrove ecology, condensation messages, and moon-healing stone. Emotional truth outweighs gimmickry—apology as temporal re-inhabitation, not time travel. Specificity anchors universals: courthouse gargoyle, fishermen’s stilt house, unsent letters pinned with shard. Bold risk (lyric accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
