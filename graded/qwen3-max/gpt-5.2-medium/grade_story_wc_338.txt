<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—her “guarded kindness” and “methodically curious” nature manifest in concrete choices (e.g., framing maps to “forgive erasures,” refusing to treat the vault as an exhibit). Her motivation—to interpret silence with empathy—drives every action without sentimentality, and her final decision to reframe the map as an archive embodies Earned Stasis with visible cost: she forgoes sealing the chapel, risking institutional disapproval. The archivist functions effectively as secondary pressure without diluting focus. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied (“air thickened with unsaid words,” “rain sounded like soft applause”).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the torn margin becomes a visible archive, transforming erasure into witness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds through pattern (shadow movement, video comparison, henge discovery) culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where silence shifts from haunting to permission. Cost is legible: Lena’s labor, ethical stance, and the archivist’s concession. Orientation is immediate (“shop above the harbor”), and causality flows through her methodical curiosity without retroactive patches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is active micro-architecture: the rain-scoured vault constrains choice (damp floor, cracked alcove), the henge orients spatial logic, and weather (rain on stones as “applause”) charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and profession-filtered—Lena notices creases, ink on stone, projector light—not tourist cataloging. The torn map functions as object-as-setting, its rip echoing the earth’s seam. Environment directly enables the climax: fresco erosion reveals erased lives, making silence tactile.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—giving voice to the erased—is signaled early and deepens when Lena discovers parish records of dispossession. Escalation is protagonist-driven: comparing footage, walking to the henge, opening the alcove. Each act narrows options (defying “DO NOT RESTORE”) and carries cost (emotional labor, potential professional risk). The shadow’s motion isn’t coincidence but a textual pressure that crystallizes Lena’s stance. Final trade-off: reopening the chapel as communal archive, not tourist site, forecloses institutional control.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: maps as instruments of erasure, silence as companion to the dispossessed. The final reframing—mounting recovered maps behind the tear—offers a non-literal answer: healing requires witnessing, not restoration. Subtext thrives in gesture (Lena sitting on damp floor to “listen for consent”) and avoids moralizing. Complexity endures: the chapel “healed or harmed depending on who listened,” and Lena’s solution honors ambiguity without false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Lena’s perceptual signature (“read a traveler from creases,” “shadow moved where no person stood”). Syntax modulates with pressure: shorter clauses during vault exploration (“Beyond the seam the ground dipped”), lyrical cadence in reflection. Voice is distinct—occupational lexicon (“framing knife,” “reels”) fused with poetic restraint (“erased lives,” “pale bones” of fresco). No head-hopping; even the archivist’s presence is mediated through Lena’s guarded warmth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the line of division cut like a seam into the earth” merges setting and theme economically. Figurative language is coherent (maps as skin, silence as company) and never overwrought. Minor deduction for one near-loop: “frame by frame” / “comparing the angles” slightly overlaps, but rhythm varies purposefully. Final line (“whispers softened into a silence that felt like permission”) earns its resonance without scaffold. No filter-verb stacks or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise transforms archival tropes through specificity: map-framing as empathetic craft, chapel whispers as testimony of erased communities. The fusion of cartography, video analysis, and henge archaeology feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Risk-taking (silent footage as clue, stone-inscribed map edge) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth anchors ingenuity—Lena’s refusal to “treat the vault as an exhibit” critiques extractive historiography with quiet authority.</comment>
