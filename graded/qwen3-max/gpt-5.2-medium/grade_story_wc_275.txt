<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maris’s pacifism and botanical ethos manifest in micro-choices that foreclose violence with visible cost—her father’s softened shoulders, the withheld rifle, the kneeling posture—all earned through consistent interiority. Tarek’s arc from bounty hunter to participant in planting shows credible transformation under pressure. Their contradictory impulses (duty vs. mercy, order vs. continuity) act simultaneously, not abstractly. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied in sand, thorns, and breath.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Tarek renounces capture, militia retreats, and seeds are planted—continuity chosen over chaos. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of quiet as bridge intensifies via roses, talisman, and sheathing until the final image reweights everything. Cost is legible—the unbuckled gunbelt, the lost bounty, the vulnerability of sheltering Lio. Orientation anchors (“third dusk,” “glass dome,” “desert”) are clear by line 30 and serve closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The glass dome, copper gutters, and sand beds aren’t backdrop—they constrain every choice: Lio hides there, roses respond to empty hands, militia rifles tap glass but cannot enter. The desert’s “breath” and “soot like dark snow” merge atmosphere with theme. Final image of planting at the rim uses setting to charge continuity. Every detail filters through Maris’s perception—no tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—continuity through chaos—is signaled early and deepens when militia arrives. Maris’s agency drives escalation: she disarms her father, kneels him into attention, and leverages the dome’s calm as defense. Cost is unmistakable: risk of death, betrayal of her father’s profession, exposure of Lio. The tightening (militia trucks → rifles on glass) forces a crystallized stance that reconfigures options without violence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: quiet as bridge, plants as moral tutors, continuity as resistance. No moralizing—the engraved brass and ring-planted seeds *show* the answer to chaos. Final image reweights the tower’s fall: not an end, but soil for new memory. Ambiguity lingers (will the council return?), but the thematic stance—cultivation over capture—is resonant and non-literal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV (Maris) with a distinct perceptual signature: she hears thirst before leaves curl, feels engines through sand. Prose rhythm modulates—long, lyrical sentences in calm; short, tactile phrases under threat (“rifles tapped the glass”). No head-hopping; even Tarek’s shift is filtered through Maris’s observation. Voice remains consistent, poetic but never academic, grounded in salt-stiff canvas and copper gutters.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density: “soot of the collapse like dark snow” conveys setting, mood, and aftermath in six words. Syntax varies purposefully—fragments for tension, flowing clauses for calm. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is coherent (roses “burn,” quiet “pulls thoughts inward like gravity”) and never muddled in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: pacifist daughter of bounty hunter uses botany as ethical pedagogy in post-collapse desert. Tropes transformed—roses aren’t just beauty but moral agents; bounty hunter isn’t redeemed by violence but by planting. Risk-taking (quiet as active resistance) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The “tranquil blaze” tone and engraved sandbag feel singular, not templated.</comment>
