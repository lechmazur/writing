<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ilya’s interiority is vividly embodied—his serenity isn’t placid but charged with ethical unease, and his micro-choices (stealing the stick, reversing letters, carving questions) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Mara’s presence sharpens relational stakes without flattening her into foil; her demand for consent forces Ilya’s blind spot into view. His emotional progression avoids tidy resolution: shame stings but clarifies, and his final act is renunciation, not redemption. The only flaw is slight over-articulation in “half-lit epiphanies,” which borders on diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Ilya forecloses his old method by publicly reversing narrative harm, with visible cost (lost autonomy, vulnerability to veto). The causal chain is tight—argument → theft recognition → reversal practice → public test → contract → collaborative performance—and the radar dome’s echo becomes literalized in communal listening. Orientation anchors instantly (“gallery,” “coat,” “Mara”), and the lens is Causal, held rigorously. Cost is legible in the napkin contract and shared control of the stick.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome functions as micro-setting: its acoustics and obsolete surveillance machinery shape Ilya’s solitude and later become the stage for ethical reenactment. The cedar story stick and ink are tactile extensions of setting that constrain choice (only holder speaks; reversed letters force memory reordering). Sensory detail is selective—“sky the color of cold tin,” “spilled gin”—and filtered through Ilya’s calligraphic attention. Final projection on the dome’s curve charges the environment with thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ethical storytelling—is signaled early and tightened when Ilya realizes editing pain erases consent. His agency drives escalation: private reversal → public puppet show → contractual boundary → shared authorship. Each turn narrows options (he can no longer borrow voices freely) and exacts cost (loss of artistic control, vulnerability to Mara’s veto). The reversal structure makes harm visible, fulfilling the moral calculus without didacticism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: reversing plot reveals complicity, and consent becomes structural, not decorative. The final image—audience passing the stick, adding truths and boundaries—offers a non-literal answer: ethical storytelling requires shared authority. No moralizing; complexity remains (Mara’s tremor, Ilya’s lingering sting). The “meteor hush” reweights silence from evasion to active listening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, with syntax modulating under pressure (shorter clauses during reversal work, lyrical flow in dome solitude). Perceptual signature is calligraphic: attention to flourishes, bone strokes, ink behavior. Dialogue is sparse but potent—Mara’s “You reversed the story” carries subtext of accusation and hope. No head-hopping; even puppet scenes filter through Ilya’s hands and intent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “obedient puppets awaiting hands” conveys abandonment and latent agency). Figurative language is purposeful (“sky the color of cold tin”) and consistent. Minor flaw: “half-lit epiphanies” slightly abstracts an otherwise embodied moment. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating during reversal work, breathing in the dome’s hush.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis: calligraphy + puppetry + radar dome creates a fresh frame for ethical storytelling. Reversing narrative structure to expose harm is ingenious and character-rooted (calligrapher undoing strokes). Risk-taking (public vulnerability, shared authorship) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Every element feels inevitable in hindsight—the stick, the dome, the reversal—all cohere into a singular artistic stance against extractive art.</comment>
