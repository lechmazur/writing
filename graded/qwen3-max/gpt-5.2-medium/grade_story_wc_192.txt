<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her scars, rituals, and breathless panic feel specific and lived-in, not diagnostic. Her contradictory impulses (to sever vs. to heal) act simultaneously in the climax when she opens the door yet keeps sleeves turned up as invitation. The final renunciation—accepting that some contact must be cut so others can breathe—is earned by prior causality and carries palpable cost. Lio’s shadow presence avoids head-hopping while deepening her moral calculus without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Earned Stasis fused with Charged Poise—the bridge rebuilds not for return but for Lio’s departure, reconfiguring Mara’s rule of severance into conditional mercy. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with cadence shifts (e.g., “breath became a thin, mean thread”) tightening pressure until the doorknocker’s underwater chime forces action. Cost is legible in the “clean imprint of knees in ash”—a void made visible. Orientation anchors instantly: “where the city ended and the sky began” grounds who, where, when without disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The ashen charcoal sanctuary isn’t backdrop—it constrains every choice: shadows hunger when the threshold thins, starlight floods like water only because walls are porous soot, and the central ring’s warmth-as-skin memory dictates ritual response. Final image charges setting: dawn light meets “last pale star” as Mara sits alone, the sanctuary now holding “loaded emptiness… no longer poison.” Sensory hierarchy narrows under stress (wet ash through cracks, iron chiming underwater), avoiding tourist cataloging. Micro-setting (scars as doors) directly enables the climax’s tactile resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—surviving absence without suffocation—is signaled early and deepens when Lio’s shadow arrives choking on the threshold. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to open the door, expose scars, and re-strike the knocker, each act narrowing options (rebuilding a bridge only to let him leave). Cost is unmistakable: “the bridge she had burned rebuild itself not to return to the past, but to let him walk back to his life”—a trade-off that crystallizes her stance. Coincidence (ring rattling) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her scar-linked method.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: bridge-burning as craft, scars as slammed doors, ash as both residue and medium. The ending reweights prior material non-literally—Mara’s ritual of severance becomes a conduit for others’ breath, transforming isolation into conditional sanctuary. No moralizing; resonance lives in “knees in ash” and “emptiness… no longer poison.” Ambiguity lingers (will the threshold hold?) without confusion, embracing complexity: mercy requires cutting contact so others may live.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: Mara notices “grain” in wood, “warm as skin” metal, “breathless shadow”—all filtered through her tender-shadow-keeper role. Rhythmic control under pressure excels: short clauses (“Lio, she realized”) amid lyrical density (“darkness could be folded like cloth”) heighten panic without losing voice. Elision is taught early (burned chapel rebuilt from silence) and paid off at closure (ring strike reinforcing threshold). No head-hopping; Lio’s POV is rendered strictly through Mara’s perception of his shadow.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density: “soot and silence” conveys material and emotional state in three words; “breath became a thin, mean thread” embodies panic without cliché. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold—every sentence propels. Figurative coherence is masterful: ash, thresholds, scars, and breath form an interlocking metaphor system without strain. Minor deduction for one slightly over-compressed phrase (“starlight spilled into the chapel like water into a sinking boat”) where simile risks muddling the sanctuary’s solidity—but clarity at closure remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms the “ghost at the door” trope through irreplaceable specifics: grief as wet ash, doorknockers holding memories as warmth, scars as doors to slammed moments. The core premise—teaching suffocation to breathe via scar-linking—feels inevitable in hindsight yet wholly fresh. Bold risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure, conceptual threshold physics) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision coheres singularly: every element serves the thematic question of how absence can be inhabited without being consumed.</comment>
