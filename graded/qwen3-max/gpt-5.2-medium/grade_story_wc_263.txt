<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sel’s interiority is vividly embodied—tasting stardust, hearing pressure as moths—and their motivation (freeing creativity) intensifies through micro-choices like tracing meteors and interpreting the elders’ “sour hush.” Contradictory impulses (exhaustion vs. awe, fear vs. resolve) act simultaneously in scene. The final endurance (“rested again under the aurora-lit archway”) reads as Earned Stasis with visible cost: trembling hands, cold, exhaustion. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises from sensory perception and action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the vault opens, stardust rises, and the city’s creative silence breaks into laughter and quarrels—before/after legible with felt cost (Sel’s physical depletion). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: meteor traces accumulate into a spiral that unlocks the vault, reweighting absence into abundance. Cost is unmistakable in “hands shook with cold and awe” and the elders’ fear cracking into astonishment. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 2 (“Sel… under [the arch]”), and the unwritten calendar tightens pressure without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: Sel must rest beneath it to sync breath with sky, and the vault seam opens “below” its stones. The astrolabe-as-tool charges the final image—placed on birch bark crossings, it warms the stones. Sensory detail is selective and urgent: stardust tastes like “grit,” creativity knocks as “pressure,” auroras shift from green to violet. Every environmental element (arch, vault, meteors) alters tactics or outcome; no white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early and deepens when Sel hears the elders’ unspoken confession of control, hardening resolve. Escalation is driven by Sel’s agency: each traced meteor tugs “something under the stones,” culminating in the seventh mark unlocking the vault. Cost is legible: physical tremors, cold, and the risk of confronting systemic suppression. The Accumulative lens rewards density increase—the birch bark map’s spiral reweights the city’s silence into clamor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: creativity as cosmic inheritance, not commodity. The final image—new meteors writing “the city’s true calendar in fire”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question (Can stolen wonder be reclaimed?) by reweighting control into collective renewal. Subtext operates in silence (“unsaid confession,” “unspoken words”) and charged objects (astrolabe, stardust). No moralizing; resonance arises from Sel letting dust pass through fingers while murals bloom “as if through dreams finally given daylight.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Sel notices taste of grit, pressure of unsaid words, auroras as “bruise of green fire.” Rhythmic control modulates with pressure—longer sentences for rapture, fragmented beats during meteor sightings (“Another followed, then another”). POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping. Elision is purposeful (elders’ motives inferred, not stated), and the lyric mode is taught early (“heard unspoken words as clearly as bells”) and paid off in closure’s “shadowed rapture.”</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“The astrolabe was heavy with memory; if Sel pressed an ear to it, the metal murmured names of stars that had died before any written year”) and varied syntax. Minor overwriting in peak beats: “green fire against the winter dark” and “silver dust that swarmed upward” slightly strain metaphor coherence, but never obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph’s cadence (“walked through them as if through dreams finally given daylight”) recharges the opening’s dreamer motif without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis: stardust as literalized inspiration, harvested meteors as seasonal muse, astrolabe as memory-vessel. Tropes (dreamer, vault, aurora) are transformed through specific mechanics—tracing meteors to unlock stone, tasting creativity as grit. Risk-taking (accumulative structure, abstract stakes) heightens meaning without gimmickry; the premise feels inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes; authenticity of vision coheres in voice, concept, and closure.</comment>
