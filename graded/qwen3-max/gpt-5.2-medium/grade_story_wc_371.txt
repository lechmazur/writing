<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mina’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—she both notices erasure and participates in it, confessing her complaint about the bakery with visceral shame. Her micro-choices (keeping the bread, kneeling to plant) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Sada’s “heuristically gentle” voice avoids sentimentality while offering conditional grace. The final act of planting seeds embodies flawed but credible endurance, foreclosing passivity at tangible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mina renounces complicity by tending life in ruins, with visible cost (her guilt, the risk of patrols). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each vanished shop, whitened streetlight, and bricked doorway compounds until the courtyard becomes a site of quiet resistance. The sprout through mortar crystallizes before/after without neat resolution. Cost is legible in the bowed acknowledgment of fragile continuity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: broken marble hides seed packets, the collapsed arcade shelters tables, and the dry fountain becomes a vessel for thyme and wheat. Sensory detail (lantern light among fig trees, crust’s faint sweetness) filters through Mina’s grief-tuned perception. Final image—the sprout in mortar—is charged by environment as active participant, not backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving the sacred in the ordinary—is signaled early and deepens when Mina’s passive noticing shifts to active gardening. Pressure tightens via state erasure (vanished bakery, painted slogans), forcing a trade-off between safety and witness. Agency emerges in planting despite fear; cost is felt in her confession and the ever-present footsteps beyond the gate. One meaningful escalation suffices, though stakes could feel more immediate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: bread, seeds, bricked walls—not abstract moralizing. The final sprout reweights the premise: memory isn’t just edible, it’s cultivatable. Subtext thrives in silence (the tea house darkening, the shared bread-dipping). No tidy redemption; absolution is “tenuous,” and repair is local, ongoing, and vulnerable—resisting false equivalence while honoring complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Mina notices “changes by inches,” filtering world through loss. Syntax modulates with pressure—longer sentences for reflection, clipped phrases during patrol footsteps. Voice remains consistent in first-person limited; no head-hopping. Diction (“creeping normality noticer,” “heuristically gentle”) feels character-born, not imposed. Elision (unexplained ministers, glass towers) serves mystery without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “bread from the vanished bakery, wrapped in cloth like a relic” does triple duty. Rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph lengths mirror emotional cadence. One minor slip: “heuristically gentle” borders on diagnostic label-speak but is redeemed by immediate behavioral illustration. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Closure image (“bowed to it”) resonates without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms familiar tropes (disappearing shops, secret gatherings) through specificity: guerrilla gardening as resistance, bread as relic, “tenuous absolution.” The synthesis of surveillance state, ecological reclamation, and sacramental ordinary feels fresh yet inevitable. Bold risk in lyrical restraint—no exposition of regime, just its footprints. Vision coheres across voice, setting, and theme without gimmickry.</comment>
