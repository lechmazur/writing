<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation—fostering interspecies respect before death—is rooted in her systematic observation and enacted through high-stakes choices (e.g., bending sacred trees despite pain and opposition). Her interiority is concrete (“chest ached,” “brazen calm”) and never slips into diagnostic abstraction. Contradictory impulses coexist: urgency vs. patience, reverence vs. rebellion. Final renunciation (lying down between pillars) is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of mortality made meaningful.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the orchard continues translating its script after Mara’s death, reconfiguring belonging as an ongoing, multi-species practice. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density builds via botanical notes, copper arches, crab behavior—culminating in the seed-pod discovery and communal vows. Cost is legible in Mara’s physical decline and the monks’ relinquished dogma. Every beat tightens around the central stake: making the temple speak to all species.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The temple orchard isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains and enables: stone pillars sweat less when water flows correctly; copper-wrapped oaks create species-specific doorways; flagstone hides seed pods that prove the temple’s nursery function. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (“lichen-veined,” “warm to the touch,” “copper glinting arches”). Setting charges the final image: Mara’s deathbed between pillars becomes a node in a living network. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent across interventions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rewriting exclusionary sacred space into inclusive ecology—is signaled early and deepens when Mara discovers the pillars’ hidden script. Her agency drives escalation: she remolds paths despite pain, counters monks with diary evidence, and pries up flagstones. Cost is unmistakable: bodily decay, social friction, and the irreversible act of altering “sacred” trees. The tightening culminates in the gathering where each vow forecloses old habits (straight walls, eelgrass destruction, crab harassment).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme—interspecies reciprocity as sacred architecture—emerges through concrete particulars, not assertion. The recurring motif of channels (in stone, wire, vows) shifts from hidden code to shared language. Final image offers non-literal answer: belonging isn’t granted by humans but co-authored by crabs, goats, moss, and stone. No moralizing; resonance arises from the diary on the altar and arches humming after rain. Complexity is preserved—monks aren’t villains but participants in transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled single-third with a distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices ecological interdependencies others miss (“figs dropped fruit for ants that later saved the figs”). Voice modulates under pressure—syntax shortens during ladder-climbing (“chest ached”), then expands lyrically at closure. No head-hopping; monks’ dialogue is filtered through Mara’s perspective. Prose rhythm mirrors thematic cadence: circular observations echoing the orchard’s design. Diction stays within caretaker’s lexicon—no register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: sentences multitask (“copper wire wrapped around oak branches to coax young limbs into arches that echoed the pillars' hidden channels”). Figurative language is coherent—water as blood, temple as nursery—and never muddled. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every paragraph advances plot or atmosphere. Final line (“remodeled orchard kept translating its living script”) recharges earlier motifs without redundancy. Minor deduction for one slightly overloaded sentence about moss/bees/goats, but clarity remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Premise transforms “dying woman finds peace” trope into radical interspecies worldbuilding. Architectural secrets aren’t hidden treasure but distributive wisdom—stone sharing water, trees sharing shade. Risk-taking (bending sacred trees, redefining prayer) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular: the temple’s true function revealed through crab paths and seed pods. No derivative echoes; specificity (Keld, feral goats, lichen-veined pillars) anchors universals. Conceptual integrity is total—every element serves the core idea of attentive coexistence.</comment>
