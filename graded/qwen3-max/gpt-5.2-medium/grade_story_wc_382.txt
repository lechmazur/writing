<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motivation—to learn the language of old buildings—is embodied in tactile, specific choices (pressing clay, reading lintels) and deepened by emotional stakes tied to heritage and memory. Ilyas is vividly rendered through idiosyncratic gestures (steam as script, correcting vowels) and functions as both mentor and ghostly pressure point. Their relationship evolves meaningfully: from sugar debt to shared subterfuge, culminating in a quiet sacrifice that forecloses Ilyas’s lingering presence with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are conveyed through action and sensory perception under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the building is saved, but Ilyas fades into mortar—a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual and emotional cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: meteor imagery, recurring dove-and-key motif, and linguistic metaphors build density until the parapet “speaks” via cracks. Causality is maintained through goal-directed actions (stamping clay, planting documents), and the inspector walk-through climax arises directly from prior beats. Orientation is immediate (“On the roof of the Dovetail Building…”), and every shard serves the closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The rooftop garden isn’t backdrop—it supplies the clay that becomes “proper speech,” directly enabling the plot’s turning point. Meteor showers frame the narrative arc, their dwindling embers mirroring Ilyas’s departure. The parapet’s carved mark and antique seal function as micro-setting: recurring objects that constrain choice (must stamp beside the stone) and charge the final image (cracks forming sentences). Sensory detail is purposeful—steam curling into letters, wax like fresh mortar—and filtered through the protagonist’s obsessive attention to architectural grammar.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—saving the Dovetail through truth disguised as bureaucracy—is signaled early and tightens when the inspector’s walk-through looms. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: choosing to interrogate Ilyas, then the inspector, and slipping documents into his folder. Cost is unmistakable: Ilyas’s dissolution into mortar is the price of preservation. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens; each meteor flare intensifies urgency without resorting to coincidence for resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: truth requires ritualized fiction to survive institutional scrutiny. The “agreed upon lies” aren’t moralized but dramatized as necessary scaffolding for deeper truth—mirroring how buildings encode history in brickwork. Final image—preservation order posted, Ilyas fading—offers non-literal answer: memory endures only when embedded in structure. No sermonizing; resonance accrues through dovetailing motifs (seal, steam-script, mortar) that reweight “language” as both spoken and built.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>First-person POV is flawlessly controlled: narration stays within the protagonist’s knowledge, with perceptual signature evident in architectural lexicon (“lintels,” “masonry whispering”). Voice modulates under pressure—syntax tightens during document theft (“I slipped… as if they were his own notes”) while lyricism blooms in reflective moments. Dialogue is sparse but distinct: Ilyas’s gentle insistence contrasts with the landlord’s off-page pragmatism. No head-hopping; even Ilyas’s ghostliness is filtered through protagonist’s sensory bias (steam as script, pale eyes).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “meteors stitched white seams across the dark, like the sky was being repaired” establishes voice and stakes in one stroke. Figurative language is coherent—steam as script, wax as mortar—and never overwhelms causality. Sentence variety supports rhythm: short clauses during tension (“I followed… clicks of old hinges”), flowing cadences in reflection. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “hairline cracks arranged themselves into lines”—“arranged” verges on anthropomorphism—but closure remains unblurred.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of urban folklore, architectural semiotics, and bureaucratic subterfuge. Tropes (ghost mentor, hidden documents) are transformed by specificity: Phoenician tutoring, dove-on-key seal, cardamom tea as ritual. Risk-taking (ghost as dead language tutor, lies as preservation tactic) heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Final image—spirit dissolving into mortar—feels inevitable yet surprising, rooted in the story’s internal logic of buildings as living texts.</comment>
