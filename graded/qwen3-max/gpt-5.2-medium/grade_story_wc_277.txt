<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Celeste’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her devotion to truth wars with inherited regret, embodied in her handling of the rosewood nib and her quiet confrontation with Sato. Her micro-choices (testing calculations, inspecting dust) reveal a hierarchy of values: integrity over spectacle. Sato’s guilt mirrors her father’s, deepening emotional resonance without sentimentality. The final bargain feels earned, foreclosing exposé for stewardship at visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Celeste renounces a sensational headline to preserve honest science, crystallizing her editorial ethos. The Causal lens holds—each beat follows from prior knowledge or choice (e.g., Lyle’s photocopy → proof by contradiction). Cost is legible in the observatory’s “applause”—a charged poise where truth survives without ruin. Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The echoing observatory functions as micro-setting: acoustics amplify doubt (“rehearsed her doubts aloud”), altitude isolates moral pressure, and the darkroom’s red lamps heighten tension. The rosewood nib and glass plates constrain choices—Celeste uses them as forensic tools. Final image of “echoes… like applause” reweights silence as validation. Every detail serves plot or theme; no white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. reputation—is signaled early and tightens when Celeste discovers the exposure-log contradiction. Her agency drives escalation: she tests Sato’s claim, inspects plates, and forces confession. The cost is conceptual (abandoning a planet story) and emotional (confronting her father’s legacy). Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from Celeste’s observant rigor under the Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurring orbits: planetary, regretful, journalistic. The final reconfiguration—truth as stewardship, not spectacle—answers the central question without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gestures: Sato’s flicker of guilt, Celeste’s nib scratching into logs. No platitudes; wisdom arises from specific acts of verification and restraint.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Celeste’s perceptual signature (“devotedly observant”). Voice modulates from rain-hushed intimacy to forensic precision, then solemn playfulness at closure. Syntax varies purposefully—long sentences for reflection, short clauses for discovery. No head-hopping; even Sato’s dialogue reveals only what Celeste observes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ink could also hide,” “orbit of regret,” “smear on a glass plate” do double duty. Figurative language is coherent (celestial metaphors sustain throughout). Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary. Final line’s “echoes… like applause” recharges earlier acoustics with thematic resonance. No scaffold or register drift—even technical details feel character-bound.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms investigative journalism tropes through specificity: the heiress wields a broken nib, not a badge; the fraud is born of grief, not greed. “Orbits of regret” synthesizes astronomy and ethics organically. Risk-taking (quiet resolution over scandal) heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight—no derivative safety.</comment>
