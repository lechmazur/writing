<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—palms reading grit “like braille,” tongue tasting choices—and their moral struggle over Jalen feels urgent and specific. Contradictory impulses (protecting vs. truth-telling) act simultaneously in scene, not as abstract summaries. The final choice to amend the log is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost (“weight settled, finally shared”). Jalen’s presence sharpens the crucible without flattening either character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the withheld truth is amended, lifting pressure from the ribs while its full weight settles—a clear before/after with felt cost. The Causal lens holds: each leap follows from sensory mapping, shard manipulation, and brother’s distress beacon. Orientation is immediate (“cold deckplates of an abandoned spaceport repair bay”), and the seam’s opening aligns with the protagonist’s cyclic pulse. The green shard’s role as both key and witness ensures no retroactive patches or teleporting props.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The repair bay functions as micro-setting: broken conduits hum with “choices,” coolant defines unseen corridors, and the hatch’s lock yields only through the shard’s redirected seam. Sensory hierarchy reflects the protagonist’s trade—taste, touch, and light over sight—and the green shard constrains every major choice. Final image charges closure: the shard stands upright like a “tiny, dangerous sail” that literally and metaphorically redirects fate. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent across universe jumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“the weight of a withheld truth”—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the beacon reveals Jalen’s location, transforming lie into measurable mass “heavier than any cargo.” Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: using the shard to redirect seams, then weaving both bodies through worlds. Cost is unmistakable: the brother’s fury (“you cut my anchor”) and the physical drag of guilt made literal. Coincidence complicates (beacon under bench) but resolution stems from skill and sacrifice, not luck.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: truth as gravitational force that “anchors worlds,” revealed through tactile metaphors (weight on ribs, shard as prism) rather than assertion. The final log entry offers a non-literal answer—truth shared becomes bearable—not a moral. Subtext thrives in silence (microphone recording silence) and implication (mother’s voice in a light seam). No thematic echo or sermonizing; complexity endures (Jalen is alive but furious, safety was illusion).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV is flawlessly controlled: perceptual signature (“tongue could taste which choices had been taken elsewhere”) modulates with stress, compressing diction during leaps but never losing rhythmic specificity. Voice remains consistent across universes; no head-hopping or register drift. Elision is purposeful—the cyclic spontaneity isn’t explained but demonstrated through action. Final line (“feeling the withheld truth lift… even as its full weight settled”) crystallizes stance with syntactic balance that mirrors thematic tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “chalk that marked temperature, a microphone that recorded silence” does triple duty. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light as seam, truth as weight) and never muddled; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary (“In the murmur…”, “I am…”, “Now there were…”) and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Only minor deduction: “wove us together through parallel universes” slightly abstracts a pivotal beat that could be more tactile.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis: “sensory map maker” reframes scifi tropes through haptic epistemology, making world-weaving feel fresh and necessary. The green shard isn’t just a MacGuffin—it’s a prism, sail, key, and familial relic whose properties dictate tactics. Risk-taking (textural causality, lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. No derivative echoes; every detail serves the core question: can truth be carried, or must it be shared to lose its crushing weight?</comment>
