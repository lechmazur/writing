<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The coachman’s interiority is concrete and character-particular, rooted in linguistic inheritance and ritual duty. His micro-choices—kneeling, cracking pods, wading for silt—reveal a hierarchy of values: honoring the dead over personal safety. Contradictory impulses (work vs. prayer, command vs. invitation) operate simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation of control (“not to command but to invite”) is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the jetty blooms, the water answers, and peace becomes an ongoing act, not a finished state. Cost is legible in the “roots threading through bullet fragments without hatred”—a reconfiguration of violence into coexistence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density increasing via layered languages, bird calls, and soil rituals. Every beat tightens the thematic stake without causal rupture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The blooming jetty functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (narrow as a spine) and charges the final image (blooms against empty sea). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: lanterns on driftwood, salt-crusted earth, gulls’ cries filtered through naval Latin. The reef’s death isn’t backdrop—it actively shapes tactics (need for land-garden, poisoned soil). Final blossoms “fold and reopen as if tasting a new season,” making environment inseparable from closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming battlefield through garden—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: he interprets gull calls, negotiates with memory-pressure, mixes ash and silt. The tightening occurs when he shifts from command to invitation, altering the terms of peace. Cost is unmistakable: he offers the dead a future tense, risking rejection, and works knee-deep in toxic water. Escalation is driven by his linguistic and ritual competence under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: peace as reciprocal labor between living, dead, and sea. No moralizing—resonance arises from seed pods rattling like bones, roots threading bullet fragments, and gulls crying “Keep it.” The ending reweights the premise: the submerged concord isn’t broken but transplanted into soil, demanding continual tending. Ambiguity lingers (will it hold?), yet the cost—fertilizing poisoned ground with ash and memory—is undeniable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Voice is exquisitely controlled: diction blends maritime lexicon (“reef-keepers,” “naval Latin”), grave-song cadence, and tactile immediacy (“bucket of dark silt”). Perceptual signature is consistent—the coachman notices language, bird calls, soil texture, not faces or politics. Syntax modulates under pressure: short clauses during ritual (“I crack open… I pour…”), lyrical flow at closure. No head-hopping; single POV remains anchored in embodied, linguistically mediated attention.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or ritual. Figurative language is pattern-taught (seed pods = bones, jetty = spine) and pays off in closure. No loops or scaffold—each image accrues meaning (lanterns lean away, blossoms fold/reopen). Minor deduction for slight over-compression in mid-section (“stitching their names together…”), but clarity never falters, especially at the decisive closing image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ecological grief, linguistic necromancy, and postwar reparation feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (dead reef, memorial council) are transformed through specific ritual logic: bird calls as divination, Eel Speech as diplomacy, compost as treaty. Bold risk—making fertilization a sacred, multilingual negotiation—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision is singular: peace isn’t declared but cultivated in poisoned earth, with cost woven into every kernel.</comment>
