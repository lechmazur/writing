<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation—rooted in trust of images over promises and her father’s teaching—is embodied through tactile expertise and micro-choices (e.g., using the aspen leaf). Her internal contradiction between loss (Lio) and duty fuels agency without sentimentality. Final renunciation (“let loss escape”) is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through gearwork, not therapy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: time is “restructured” into a vessel that lets loss escape, reweighting the premise with emotional cost. The Causal lens holds—each fix (leaf tick → governor → hand stabilization) drives the next beat. Cost is legible in the final image: the pod launches, but Lio remains unrecovered. Orientation anchors instantly (“Above the clouds... Selene Peak”).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The observatory isn’t backdrop—it constrains every choice (shaking foundation misaligns rails; vapor-breathing domes mirror instability). The aspen leaf cylinder functions as micro-setting, enabling the fix. Final image (“Moon bright as a scar,” cloud seas below) charges closure with scale and solitude. Tools (brass lenses, clockwork) are handled tactically, not cataloged.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capturing micrometeor flashes before dawn—is pressured by quake, spinning clock, and launch dependency. Mara’s agency deepens stakes: she replaces digital reliance with analog leaf-tick timing, narrowing options to one fragile method. Cost is visible: two windows already lost, rails at risk of permanent misalignment. Escalation is causal, not coincidental.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme—ephemerality vs. constancy—emerges through action: bottling flares, fixing clocks, launching pods. The final image reweights the central question: can time be honest enough to let loss escape? No moralizing; resonance accrues via recurring objects (leaf, clock, camera) that shift from tools to talismans. Complexity endures—success doesn’t resurrect Lio, only transmits data.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is precise: Mara notices gears like prayers, hears ticks over quakes. Syntax tightens under pressure (“She clamped... routed... restructured”), then breathes in lyrical closures. Voice remains consistent—technical yet poetic, never slipping into exposition or head-hopping. Elision (e.g., Lio’s fate) is taught early and paid off emotionally at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “domes breathed slow vapor as if the mountain itself were thinking” establishes tone without overwriting. Figurative language is coherent (comet-like clock hand, Moon as scar). Minor scaffold in “frantic pulse against her own”—slightly redundant—but no loops or artifacts dull closure. Final paragraph’s rhythm modulates perfectly with rising stakes and release.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lunar observatory + camera repair + micrometeor science + grief. Tropes (stoic technician, broken clock) are grounded in specific mechanics (leaf-tick governor, rail alignment). Risk-taking (analog fix in digital crisis) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular—no echo of familiar lines; every detail serves character and concept.</comment>
