<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sera’s interiority is exquisitely embodied: blistered hands that “still wanted to hold someone gently,” the arsonist/archivist duality, and her final choice to broadcast rather than burn—all reveal a coherent, contradictory self under pressure. Her micro-choices (scraping the canvas with the tapestry, copying instead of destroying the reel) enact a credible moral evolution rooted in prior causality. The cost—abandoning her identity as protector-by-fire—is felt in her “chest roar[ing]” yet choosing preservation. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile action and sensory memory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “PROMISES DO NOT BURN” reframes fire from destruction to revelation, and Sera’s broadcast reweights the regime’s foundational lie with undeniable social cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—artistic signs accrue into a decipherable trail—and each beat tightens pressure toward the archive. Cost is legible in the final image: her love becomes “a volcano turned outward,” sacrificing anonymity for truth. Orientation anchors instantly (“ash flats,” “basalt ridge”) and disorientation serves closure (the vandalized portrait as lock).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ash flats, basalt ridge, and obsidian steps aren’t backdrop—they constrain and charge every choice. The archive’s “ribs of a patient beast” and warm-breathing seam fuse setting with theme, while the tapestry fragment functions as micro-setting, enabling decryption and final action. Sensory detail is selective and urgent: charcoal sketches, soot-stained hands, tar masks—all filtered through Sera’s tactile urgency. The final broadcast tower isn’t described but implied by momentum, keeping focus on the charged object-world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescuing truth to fulfill Miko’s promise—tightens decisively when the vandalized portrait becomes a lock requiring her fragment, foreclosing retreat. Protagonist agency drives escalation: mapping signs, aligning spirals, scraping paint. The deepening occurs in the archive chamber where “BRING THE FIRE HERE” forces renunciation of arson for revelation. Cost is unmistakable: she copies the reel instead of burning it, trading catharsis for exposure, risking everything by carrying truth to the capital.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: fire as both erasure and illumination, archives as libraries that survived. The final image—truth spilling across airwaves while love “lights the way home for everyone still reading in the dark”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to censorship without moralizing. Subtext thrives in the tar-mask fusion of Sera and Miko’s faces, embodying how love and resistance intertwine. No platitudes; wisdom arises from soot-stained hands and polymer reels.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is singularly Sera’s: percussive yet lyrical, with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure (“her chest roared, the old arsonist in her begging for flame”). Perceptual signature is consistent—she reads patterns in her ribs, sees art as code. No head-hopping; even Miko’s presence is filtered through memory and artifact. Compression is purposeful (months of silence conveyed in one sentence), and elision pays off when the spiral aligns. Diction stays within her lexicon—no register drift—even in peak emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines: “threadbare as old breath” conveys texture, fragility, and time. Sentence rhythm varies naturally—short staccato phrases during discovery (“Then came the third sign”) contrast lyrical flows in reflection. One minor flaw: “stubborn flowers of paint and wire” slightly strains metaphor coherence (flowers ≠ wire), but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; every image propels story or character. Final line’s “volcano turned outward” crystallizes tone without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms familiar tropes (arsonist-as-hero, hidden archive) through specific, grounded choices: fire as protective erasure, art as cryptographic trail, the archive as living organism. Emotional truth outweighs novelty—their fused identities in the vandalized portrait feel earned, not gimmicky. Bold risk: making the climax archival labor (copying reels) rather than spectacle, which heightens stakes by prioritizing preservation over pyrotechnics. Vision is cohesive: voice, setting, and moral calculus synthesize into an inevitable, fresh whole.</comment>
