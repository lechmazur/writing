<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lani’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her fear lives in her throat, her translation work is tactile, and her moral calculus emerges through micro-choices (e.g., prioritizing note decryption over the captain’s questions). Her flaw—carrying others’ anxieties as her native tongue—drives every action without safety-hedging. The coral fragment isn’t just symbolic; it’s a tool she uses to regulate trauma, aligning perfectly with her professional identity and emotional limits. Her final act of grafting meaning onto wounds feels earned because it mirrors her lifelong practice of linguistic mediation under fire.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cast’s smudged notes reweight “funeral/meeting” from threat to shared mourning, transforming war logic into human connection. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through layered languages, tear-swollen ink, and coral ridges converging on the cast-as-labyrinth. Cost is legible in the captain’s sleeplessness, villagers swapping revenge for vigil, and Mako’s arm remembering scribbles over bullets. Every beat tightens around Lani’s decryption work, with no causal breaks or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium isn’t backdrop—it’s a pressure chamber where footsteps sound like prayers and twilight bleaches lilies to coins, mirroring the story’s moral grayscale. Crucially, the pond micro-setting enables the recovery placement that makes the cast accessible, while the coral fragment (a body-scale object) constrains Lani’s choices by anchoring her trauma response. Sensory hierarchy reflects Lani’s translator priorities: she notices linguistic textures (pidgin vs. naval English) before visual details. The reef’s destruction echoes in both coral and cast, charging the final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preventing war via mistranslated grief—is signaled early and deepens when Lani decodes the map/time amid false-friend peril. Escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses to translate notes before answering the captain, then bridges frequencies using shared anxieties as tactical leverage. Cost is unmistakable: rifles are loaded, sleeplessness stiffens the captain, and Mako’s broken arm becomes the parchment for peace. The tightening forecloses ambush/revenge paths, replacing them with candlelit vigil—a trade-off paid in vulnerability, not victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the cast’s labyrinthine notes and coral’s regenerative biology, avoiding moralizing. The central question—can wounds become conduits for connection?—is answered non-literally when Mako’s scribbled arm unknits war, reweighting all prior violence. Subtext thrives in silence: rebels and soldiers sign the same plaster, their tear-blurred ink confessing identical fears. Complexity persists—no false equivalence between patrol boats and villagers—but the story earns its hope through specific, costly acts, not platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lani’s perceptual signature filters everything through linguistic precision: she hears “false friends that start wars,” sees ink swell where tears fell, and translates “lotus-hearted ache” as professional idiom. Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure—short clauses during radio calls (“rifles loaded”) contrast with lyrical cadence in reflection (“reefs heal by grafting”). No head-hopping; even the captain’s arrival stays filtered through Lani’s exhausted focus. Voice remains consistent from opening twilight to final grafting metaphor, with diction rooted in her translator lexicon (e.g., “decrypting,” “naval English”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density: “water lilies into gray coins” conveys setting, mood, and moral ambiguity in six words. Figurative language is pattern-taught (coral ridges = cast labyrinth) and payoff-perfect, with zero mixed metaphors. Sentence variety propels momentum—participles for urgency (“rubbed it when old sounds tried to return”), periodic sentences for resonance (“so his arm could remember not the bullet but the day…”). No loops, scaffold, or register drift; even “lotus-hearted ache” feels character-earned, not ornamental.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms ceasefire tropes through hyper-specificity: brain coral as trauma regulator, pidgin signatures on plaster, “funeral/meeting” false friends. The core ingenuity—using a child’s cast as diplomatic parchment—feels inevitable in hindsight, growing from Lani’s profession and Mako’s shrewd innocence. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over plot mechanics) heightens stakes by making language itself the battlefield. Vision coheres singularly: every image serves the thesis that shared anxiety, not grand treaties, unknots war.</comment>
