<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her grief is embodied in ash-filled throat and stubborn curiosity, not therapy-speak. Her micro-choices (sitting beside Eli, not grabbing him; speaking to the dead through traced connections) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Eli’s emotional arc is credible and pressured, not ornamental. The final renunciation—revising the dead’s script—is earned by her history and method.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara reconfigures the photograph’s meaning (“STAY, PLEASE”) and thus the dead’s loop, foreclosing surrender with the cost of reliving trauma. The Causal lens holds—each beat follows because/therefore logic (photo → pulse → stairwell → phone call). Cost is legible in “throat full of ash” and the hearing aid’s warmth as counterpoint to summons. Orientation is immediate and functional disorientation (who is calling?) pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium, stairwell, and auditorium wing are tactile and pressure-bearing—Mara navigates them under guidance of the hearing aid. The photograph and hearing aid function as micro-settings that constrain choice: the aid directs movement; the photo demands reinterpretation. Final image of the warm hearing aid charges closure by contrasting summoning heat with living pulse. Sensory detail (fogged windows, soot-smudged sign) serves urgency without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting the vulnerable from grief’s predatory recursion—is signaled early and tightens when Mara recognizes herself in the photo. The escalation is driven by her agency: she traces pulses, intervenes via naming lineage, and revises the dead’s message. Cost is unmistakable: she reopens her own wound to save Eli. Coincidence (Eli finding the photo) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the resolution comes from Mara’s causal chain of tracing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: grief as a contagious echo that the living can revise. The photograph’s smudged addition (“PLEASE”) becomes the non-literal answer—agency lies not in obeying the dead but amending their final belief. No moralizing; resonance accrues through object handling and dialogue. The closing warmth of the hearing aid reweights the premise: connection persists not through summons but through stubborn presence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices electrical stutters, fogged glass, metronomic pulses—filtered through her role and trauma. Rhythmic control under pressure is masterful (short sentences during intervention; lyrical flow in reflection). No head-hopping; single POV held with psychic distance calibrated to plausible knowledge. Elision (how the fire happened) is purposeful and paid off via the photograph’s revision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High information density: nearly every line advances character, plot, or atmosphere. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally (e.g., “She assured Jessa… though her own throat felt full of ash”). Figurative language is precise (“air held a reeling hush,” “static that sounded almost like relief”) without muddle. Final line (“steady beat of her own stubborn, curious life”) recharges motifs without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: “contact tracer for hearts” transforms pandemic-era roles into metaphysical guardianship. The hearing aid as ghost detector feels inevitable in hindsight, grounded in familial inheritance and technical plausibility. Risk-taking (quiet climax, lyric closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Premise avoids template by rooting supernatural mechanics in embodied grief and professional specificity.</comment>
