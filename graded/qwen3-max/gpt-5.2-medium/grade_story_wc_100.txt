<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Marek’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “inadvertent stubbornness” manifests in tactile micro-choices (carrying the lens, patching his suit with burial linen) that escalate under pressure. His emotional state degrades believably (ears bleeding, suit seams whispering), and his final endurance carries visible cost. The catalog card in his own handwriting deepens internal conflict without exposition. His flaws actively complicate resolution rather than merely flavoring it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Marek’s refusal to abandon the dead reconfigures the library into a functioning mausoleum, with the sigh-like tone signaling rest achieved at personal cost (bleeding ears, exhaustion). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through sensory and symbolic layering until the final cadence shift (“the sea feels lighter”) reweights everything. Every beat links via pattern intensification, not causality, yet the distress signals’ transformation into catalog numbers creates undeniable narrative logic. The chased stillness sitting beside him crystallizes the before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The underwater library functions as both macro- and micro-setting: kelp curtains, chained tables, wax-sealed books, and drifting shelves all constrain Marek’s movement and inform his tactics. The broken lens and diving suit patched with burial linen serve as tool-as-setting, directly shaping action. Crucially, the environment charges the final image—the sea feeling “lighter” only works because the prior setting established weight, silence, and archival resistance. Spatial choreography remains coherent even during impossible-space maneuvers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—giving rest a permanent address—is signaled immediately and tightens when Marek learns the dead are drifting into oblivion. His agency drives escalation: choosing to enter, occupying impossible spaces, and reviving the receiver are all active renunciations of easier paths. The cost is unmistakable: physical trauma, temporal disorientation (catalog card dated ahead), and emotional burden (“pleading” taps). Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens—each plankton-lit shelf adds weight until the final stitch of light pulls bones home.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Marek’s work: memory as architecture against entropy. The lighthouse lens—once for warning, now for cataloging—reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image (“sea feels lighter”) offers a non-literal answer: rest isn’t absence but precise placement. Subtext thrives in silence (sealed books, tapped coordinates) and gesture (wax-smearing, breath-bubble revival), avoiding diagnostic labels or overt allegory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is exquisitely controlled: Marek’s perceptual signature filters every detail through his trade (“coffins floated loose,” “road still holds footsteps”). Syntax modulates under pressure—longer, lyrical sentences early; fragmented urgency during bone-stitching. No head-hopping, no register drift; even elevated diction (“chased stillness,” “resonant reconfiguration”) stays within undertaker-poet lexicon. The opening line (“tide seems to pause”) perfectly anchors voice and stakes, while the closing (“keep the cracked lens as proof”) recharges it.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence multitasks (e.g., “kelp has knitted a curtain” establishes setting, implies time, and suggests sentience). Figurative language is consistent (architectural/body metaphors: “drowned ribs,” “glass ribs”) and never muddled. Minor overwriting in “shattered glass gathers the tapping into beams” slightly slows momentum, but closure remains sharp. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts; rhythm varies naturally to mirror descent, labor, and ascent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis: undertaker as archivist of the drowned, lighthouse lens as cataloging tool, distress signals as ghostly metadata. Tropes (haunted library, mysterious package) are transformed by specificity—salt-crystal maps, burial-linen patches, wax-sealed books. The impossibility of “occupying gaps” feels earned by librarian lore, not gimmickry. Bold risk-taking (textural accumulation over plot causality) heightens thematic stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
