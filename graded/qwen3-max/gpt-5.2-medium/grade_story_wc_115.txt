<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s confession and the narrator’s recklessness/skepticism form a compelling interior contradiction that drives micro-choices (e.g., turning the wheel, calling Mara). The final renunciation—choosing truth over silence—is earned through prior causality and carries relational cost. Embodied perception (“eyelids click,” “drowsy alertness”) avoids diagnostic labels. Flaws feel lived-in, not safety-hedged.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator seals the ghost shift but carries the truth outward, crystallizing a moral stance with visible cost—ending complicity. The Causal lens holds: each beat links via “because/therefore” (radio → insight → action → revelation). Cost is legible in the dented tag and the ghosts’ lean. Orientation anchors are immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tunnel, valve wheel, and radio function as micro-settings that constrain choice—the beaded wheel must be turned, the rails walked, the psychic calls interpreted. Sensory detail (“wet iron,” “wool coats and cigarettes”) is selective and pressure-driven. The buried bay’s impossible physics are cued early by the radio’s spectral callers, making the ghost shift feel inevitable, not arbitrary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bearing witness to swallowed truth—tightens when the narrator chooses to retrieve and act on the badge. Agency is clear: turning the wheel opens the bay; reversing it seals accountability. Cost is felt in the physical heft of the tag and the burden of knowing. Escalation is driven by protagonist choices under a Causal lens, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: truth as weight, silence as complicity, ghosts as unresolved labor. The ending reweights the premise—absolution isn’t granted by spirits but by human action—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture (ghosts pushing carts through each other) and image (badge as rosary). Ambiguity lingers: will Mara confess? But the cost of silence is undeniable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is flawlessly controlled—perceptual signature (“appraise mysteries” via radio psychics) modulates with pressure. Voice blends industrial grit (“grease,” “soot-dark coveralls”) with lyrical precision (“room went so quiet I could hear my own eyelids click”). Syntax varies rhythmically; no head-hopping or register drift. Elision (backstory of push) is paid off in the tag’s reveal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language (“confession dropped like a bolt,” “tunnel breathed”) is coherent and pattern-taught. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks. Final line (“stop her from hiding behind my silence”) crystallizes stakes without overwriting. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally across tension gradients.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms ghost-story tropes through specific labor-history texture (factory shifts, punch clocks) and a skeptic’s method (radio psychics as lie-detector). The fusion of industrial salvage, spiritual accounting, and moral reckoning feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (ghosts as bureaucratic laborers) heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Vision is singular, cohesive, and irreplaceable.</comment>
