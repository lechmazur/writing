<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied hesitation and micro-choices—her silence, her handling of the lens, her copying of doodles—all revealing a hierarchy of loyalty over protocol. Eli’s presence sharpens status dynamics without dialogue; their mutual suspicion crystallizes into trust via shared risk. The final ledger-signing enacts Earned Stasis: transparency as renunciation of protective secrecy, with visible social cost. No diagnostic label-speak; grief and mistrust manifest through tactile behavior, not exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara’s signed ledger and displayed evidence reconfigure communal silence into shared vulnerability, with conceptual cost—exposing herself to institutional reprisal. The Causal lens holds: each beat follows because/therefore logic (eavesdropping → pattern recognition → lens revelation → confrontation). Orientation anchors instantly (“forecourt of Larkspur Conservatory,” “midnight”), and the projector-lens mystery pays off cohesively. Cost is legible in the final image: musicians gathering “freed by what was plainly shared.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The “crushed crystal” forecourt isn’t backdrop—it constrains movement (whispering stones betray footsteps) and charges the climax (steam at dawn visually echoes thawing mistrust). The lens functions as micro-setting: its magnification enables plot-critical perception and symbolizes distorted vs. clarified truth. Spatial choreography is precise: stage door → forecourt → office window route matters tactically. Sensory detail (graphite smudges, damp stone, resonant hush) filters through Mara’s registrar POV, never touristy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring trust in a wordless world—is signaled early and tightens when the lens reveals hidden coordination, forcing Mara to choose between complicity or exposure. Her agency drives escalation: copying doodles, using the lens, confronting Eli. The cost is felt in her isolation (“fear... pressed her tongue”) and crystallizes in the ledger-signing—an irreversible forfeiture of protective anonymity. Coincidence complicates (shattered projector) but resolution stems from Mara’s choice to trust.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: secrecy breeds suspicion; honesty, even wordless, restores connection. The split-circle doodle shifts from accusation to coordination, reweighting silence from weapon to conduit. Final image—tickets and lens laid out like “transparently arranged stones”—answers the central question non-literally: transparency as architecture, not confession. No moralizing; resonance accrues through concrete particulars (deaf children’s captions, scholarship access).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is flawlessly controlled single-third, with perceptual signature rooted in Mara’s registrar habits (archiving, tracing, observing). Syntax modulates under pressure: short clauses during discovery (“She could have marched out...”), lyrical flow in reflection. Voice avoids head-hopping; Eli’s interiority remains opaque until his drawing reveals intent. Diction stays within plausible lexicon (“cryptic doodles,” “resonant hush”), never drifting into academic abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “stones whisper, a sound so soft it seemed borrowed from breath” does triple duty (setting, mood, motif). Figurative language is pattern-taught (crystal → steam → transparency) without muddle. Minor artifact: “ambiguously clear” slightly strains as descriptor, but payoff justifies it. Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Final line’s “transparently arranged stones” perfectly echoes opening image with reweighted meaning.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise transforms “post-verbal society” trope through specific stakes: silent concerts as both aesthetic choice and social fracture. Ingenuity lies in the doodle system—plausible, tactile, thematically resonant—and the lens as dual-purpose tool/misunderstood evidence. Risk-taking (no dialogue, abstract conflict) heightens emotional precision without gimmickry. Vision feels singular: bureaucratic quietude intersecting artistic subterfuge to serve marginalized children.</comment>
