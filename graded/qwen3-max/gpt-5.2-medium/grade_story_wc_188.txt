<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Jorin’s motivation—to defy the gravity of hopelessness—is embodied in tactile choices (chanting, handling the rag knot, filtering river water) and crystallizes in his final act of teaching flame-spinning to a trembling boy. His internal contradiction—playfulness versus despair—is active throughout, not summarized. The child’s map forces a moral pivot that aligns with his core trait: using beauty as resistance. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through action, tool use, and rhythm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the sky remains starless, but “no longer felt empty” because collective action redefines hope. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds via chant, mosaic tile, map, and fireworks until pressure reweights the fortress’s moral stance. Cost is legible: Mirel defies council pride, Jorin risks complicity, and the camps enter as orderly lines, not a mob. Every beat tightens around the central question: can beauty alter power?</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The blooming fortress isn’t backdrop—it’s a moral trap: flowers perfume walls while famine camps ring it. The river gate, collapsed masonry, and inner courtyard choreograph spatial pressure that shapes every decision. The kerosene rag knot functions as micro-setting, constraining Jorin’s tactics (spinning flame safely) and charging the final image when passed to the boy. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: smell of fuel steadies him more than “any sermon.”</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deflecting riot through art—tightens when the hidden map shifts Jorin’s goal from spectacle to subversion. Agency drives escalation: he chooses low bursts to disarm the council, then arrows to reveal the river gate. Cost is visible: workers clear rubble under cover of playful sparks, converting panic into purpose. Coincidence (the child’s note) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the solution requires Jorin’s craft and Mirel’s courage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: sparks that “choose to climb” reframe defiance as collective ascent, not individual heroism. The final image—“show people... how to rise together”—answers the central question without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture: the solemn grin exchanged between Jorin and the child carries more weight than any declaration. Complexity endures: the council’s fear isn’t mocked but outmaneuvered by staged joy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is immaculate: Jorin filters the world through a pyrotechnician’s senses—smell of kerosene, echo of coughing, warmth of a mosaic tile. Rhythmic control modulates with pressure: chants sync fuse lengths to syllables, prose shortens during ignition. No head-hopping; ambient awareness stays strictly character-bound. Voice remains consistent even in lyric passages (“sky a lid of soot-gray cloud”), never slipping into exposition or omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “fireworks had turned the night into a stage with rules” does thematic, atmospheric, and plot work in one line. Figurative language is pattern-taught (chant as recipe, sparks as climbers) and payoff-earned. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“He chanted,” “Inside,” “At a turning”). Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the chant’s rhythm, closing the sonic arc without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms the “artist as savior” trope by tethering wonder to logistics: filtering river water for paste, braided rag knots, mosaic tiles as message carriers. The fusion of pyrotechnics and civil disobedience feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk: resolving starvation not with food but with choreographed light that reorders social behavior. No safety hedging—the council’s pride and the camps’ desperation remain morally unresolved, only momentarily bridged by beauty.</comment>
