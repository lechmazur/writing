<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Len and Yara’s motivations are deeply rooted in shared loss and opposing responses to chaos—his longing for multiplicity, her need for restoration. Their interior contradictions (revolutionary guilt vs. academic duty) manifest in micro-choices: Len covering mirrors, Yara conceding to joint exhibition. Emotions are embodied (“burnished sorrow,” “grief for the civilization both had never met”) without diagnostic labels. The shard becomes a crucible forcing relational recalibration, not just ideological debate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the map reframes Palimpsest as a meeting ground, not an outpost, reweighting the entire dispute. The storm’s visible-time strata enable branching futures, but Len’s velvet-draping method—a tactic born from prison trauma—creates the conditions for revelation. Cost is legible: both sacrifice factional purity to stage a third act that refuses ownership. Lens is Accumulative/Textural, with density intensifying through layered time, mirrors, and dialogue until the final projection crystallizes meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures choices: gilded buttresses bolted to iron craters, corridors where “each hour [is] a thing you could trip over.” Visible time functions as micro-setting—pooling like honey, flashing like coins—and directly enables the climax when it projects the map through strata. The Mirror Gallery’s architecture dictates tactics (covering panels), and the storm scraping the hull like “a bow on tarnished brass” ties environment to emotional cadence. Final image charges closure: blurred borders on the projected map literalize thematic openness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to treat the past—is signaled early and deepens when the shard’s lilies are contested. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: Len’s decision to cover mirrors creates the dark space for confession, which leads to joint action. The storm’s violence raises pressure, but resolution stems from their choice to project the map *through* visible time, not hide or claim it. Cost is clear: both abandon factional loyalty, risking irrelevance to prevent repeating “the old mistake.”</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the vase shard: brokenness as honesty, multiplicity as mercy. No moralizing—insight arises when Len realizes the shard was “broken on purpose, a ritual of choosing many futures over one.” The exhibition’s design embodies subtext: covered mirrors deny certainty, while layered time blurs borders. Final resonance lies in people “arguing differently,” suggesting the civilization inside the shard finally breathes—not because truth was found, but because interpretation was democratized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is tightly focalized through Len, with perceptual signature evident in poetic naming (“shadows,” “burnished sorrow”) and time-as-texture metaphors. Voice modulates under pressure: lyrical during reflection (“time draped the void in thin, colored strata”), terse during action (“he covered the gallery mirrors with velvet drops”). Dialogue carries subtext—Yara’s academic precision vs. Len’s poetic indirection—and converges only at closure in shared purpose. No head-hopping; even Yara’s grief is filtered through Len’s observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or conflict. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“visible time” as auroras, honey, thrown coins) and pays off in the storm’s “branching futures.” Syntax varies purposefully—long, baroque sentences for setting; short clauses for crisis (“He covered the mirrors”). Zero loops or scaffold; even high-density lines like “a poem of exile” do triple duty (character, object, theme). Final line’s “civilization inside the shard begin to live” recharges all prior motifs without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise—visible time as archaeological medium—is ingeniously fused with theme: history isn’t fixed but strata to be navigated. Tropes (revolutionary relic, academic vs. digger) are transformed by specificity: the Consortium’s collapse haunts through personal loss (Yara’s sister), not exposition. Risk-taking (nonlinear time, lyric structure) heightens stakes—the storm doesn’t resolve but reveals. Originality peaks in the third act: an exhibition that weaponizes ambiguity, making the asteroid itself a participant in reinterpretation.</comment>
