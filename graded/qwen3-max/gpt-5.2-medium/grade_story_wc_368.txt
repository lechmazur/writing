<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maru’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—“heart thudding politely,” “quietly explosive”—and her contradictions (dye master who cannot dye a story, trained to control bleed yet learning to make room) drive every micro-choice. The final vow emerges not as epiphany but earned renunciation, with visible cost: surrendering mastery for vulnerability. Sairi’s presence haunts without overshadowing, and Eno functions as catalyst, not crutch. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile detail (morpho wing’s cold flash, dye sparks in palms).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sun-trail map reweights storytelling from magnetism to service, with iridescent caution as ethical practice. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each glint accumulates meaning until the final jar reframes joy as communal, not hoarded. Cost is legible: Maru accepts that stories demand sacrifice, not control. Orientation is immediate (“valley under mist… floating rock tea house”), and the three-morning structure tightens pressure without slack.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house isn’t backdrop—it rotates, levels against wind, houses prisms that activate the map, and culminates in the dye-jar discovery beneath its deck. The morpho wing and sun trails function as micro-settings that constrain action: light must be caught just so, dye must be shared. Sensory hierarchy reflects Maru’s profession—indigo, blue morpho, Caution dye—all filtered through a dyer’s precision. Final image of mist illuminated by sparks ties environment directly to thematic closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning why stories magnetize—is tested when Maru realizes it’s not charisma but generosity that draws narrative. Each sun-trail dot deepens this by revealing Sairi’s anonymous aid, narrowing Maru’s path from envy to emulation. The tightening occurs when she resists her instinct to “fix” or “control” stories, choosing instead to “make room.” Cost is felt in her trembling hands and borrowed pulse—agency lies in renouncing authorship for stewardship.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through precise particulars: dye, wings, light—not abstract musings. The final vow (“dye cloth like Sairi lived”) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: stories thrive not in capture but circulation. Subtext thrives in silence—the unspoken grief of donor/recipient, the weight of unfinished journeys. No moralizing; wisdom arises from handling the jar, pressing scales to glass, watching sparks paint ghosts into mist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>First-person voice is saturated with Maru’s perceptual signature: noticing stains, lies, bleed. Syntax modulates with pressure—longer sentences for reflection (“I owned the last thing…”), fragmented urgency during sun-tracking. No head-hopping; Eno’s dialogue stays minimal, functional. Diction remains within a dyer’s lexicon (“iridescent caution,” “control bleed”) without slipping into academic register. The prose itself dyes meaning—every image stained with purpose.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density: “rope stair,” “brass wires held prisms,” “moth-wing stopper” each do triple duty. Rhythm varies naturally—opening lyrical, middle procedural, climax breathless. Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors cohere (heart as plot hook, sun as storyteller). One minor overwriting risk (“quietly explosive” appears twice) but justified by recontextualization—first as fear, then as generative force. Final line crystallizes without flourish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: transplant narrative fused with craft ethics, where donor organs carry not just life but unfinished narrative obligations. Tropes transformed—floating tea house isn’t whimsy but a literal platform for revelation; “magnetizing stories” subverted into quiet service. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over plot causality) heightens stakes: the real journey is internal recalibration. Vision feels singular—no template echoes, only indelible images (blue morpho in shadow, dye that drinks air).</comment>
