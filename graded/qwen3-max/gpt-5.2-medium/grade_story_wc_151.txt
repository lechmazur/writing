<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—fear in “hard dots over an i,” tactile memory of chalk, professional ritual with the clipboard—and their micro-choices (scanning margins, inventing ‘M. Return’) stem from consistent traits. The courier’s trembling hands and evasive eyes create immediate secondary pressure without headcount bloat. Contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. caution, professionalism vs. moral intervention—act simultaneously during the discovery of ghost-notes. The final pseudonym choice carries visible cost: complicity in a trap that risks exposure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the “citywide skin” of surface mail is revealed as surveilled, reweighting every prior mention of envelopes and margins with social cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through recurring motifs (chalk, margins, gold tiles) until the child’s hopscotch becomes a map, breaking pattern to expose theft. Orientation is flawless by line 3 (“golden arcade at dawn,” “I am a pseudonym creator”). The maintenance hatch discovery and mailing trap form a decisive, earned sequence with no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The golden arcade isn’t backdrop—it actively shapes tactics: roof panels project names onto floor-as-envelope, antique slots hide the RETURNS hatch, and chalk residue enables margin calibration. Every sensory detail serves pressure—warm bars of light, hummed tunes, polymer folder texture—and the micro-setting (clipboard, chalk, tiles) constrains choices. The dawn timing limits action window while amplifying solitude needed for scanning. Final image (“citywide skin… whispering truths at the edges”) charges the entire setting with thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—sending an untraceable letter—intensifies when ghost-notes reveal systemic interception, transforming a naming job into sabotage. Protagonist agency drives escalation: juxtaposing names → decoding chalk → guiding courier → inventing trap-pseudonym. Cost is unmistakable: the courier’s fear, the risk of entrapment, and the irreversible exposure of archival betrayal. Coincidence (child’s chalk) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from protagonist’s calibrated expertise under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: privacy as fragile skin, nostalgia weaponized by surveillance. The final image reweights “envelopes” as both relic and vulnerability—no moralizing, just the haunting whisper of “truths at the edges.” Subtext thrives in gestures: trembling fingers, chalk codes disguised as play, the ebony clipboard as heirloom-turned-tool. Central question—can anonymity protect truth?—is answered non-literally: only by embedding counter-surveillance in the very medium being exploited.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>First-person POV is exquisitely controlled: perception filters through professional lexicon (“calibration tables,” “postal membrane”) and familial memory (“grandmother’s whistle”). Voice modulates under stress—sentences tighten during scanning, syntax fractures slightly at discovery (“DO NOT TRUST THE ARCHIVE”). No head-hopping; courier remains opaque except through observed behavior. Perceptual signature is distinct: notices pressure gradients, light refraction, chalk residue—all tied to trade. Diction stays within plausible bounds; even “polymer folder” feels character-native.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “messages ride the skin of the city in thin printed layers” does worldbuilding, metaphor, and stakes in one breath. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“Below those bars…”, “I came early…”, “A child had been…”). Figurative language is coherent—light “bars,” drones as “pigeons,” mail skins as “dried leaves”—all reinforcing tactile surveillance theme. One minor slip: “ceremonial thing that kept my contracts” slightly abstract, but immediately grounded by physicality of scanning paper’s edge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Premise fuses epistolary tradition with speculative tech in a fresh synthesis: surface mail as emotional metadata carrier. Tropes (anonymous letters, hidden archives) are transformed by specific mechanics—chalk calibration, floor-as-envelope, pseudonyms as traps. Risk-taking (lyric density, accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular: nostalgic futurism where commerce relics house covert systems, and children’s play cracks state surveillance. No derivative echoes; every detail serves the core conflict.</comment>
