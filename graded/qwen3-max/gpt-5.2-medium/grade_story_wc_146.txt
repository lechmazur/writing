<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sava and Mara are rendered with precise interiority and embodied contradiction—Sava’s cryptic patience versus bleeding soles, Mara’s hesitant joining. Their relationship functions as a crucible: the braided rhythm alters both character and setting (lintel easing, shutters unwarped). Micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values (walking despite pain, trusting sound over sight). Flaws are active, not decorative; motivation intensifies under pressure without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the town proves “alive” through collective rhythm, foreclosing abandonment with felt cost (bleeding feet, drifting neighbors returning). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via footsteps, fork hums, chalk marks until the final spiral of dust triggers the decree carrier’s reversal. Every beat tightens the central stake: balance slipping through stones. Cost is legible in Sava’s physical sacrifice and the townspeople’s reclaimed agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The basalt archway isn’t backdrop—it’s the town’s ear, actively shaping Sava’s tactics and the climax. Cobblestones function as throat and pulse; kiln, bell, and fountain become resonant extensions of setting. Sensory detail is selective (sound-swallowing stone, dull ring of facades) and filtered through Sava’s auditory obsession. Final image—dust spirals rising from rhythmic steps—charges the setting with irreversible consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring shared balance before collapse—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency: Sava’s walking, Mara’s joining, communal pacing. Pressure tightens when the governor’s decree looms; the final measure under the arch is a high-stakes crystallization. Cost is visible (bleeding soles) and conceptual (abandonment averted only through collective sonic labor). Coincidence never resolves; the carrier’s change stems directly from the townspeople’s earned resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: a community as an instrument requiring tuning, not repair. Subtext lives in silence, footfalls, and the fork’s hum—not moralizing. The ending reweights the premise: survival isn’t economic but harmonic, measured in resonance, not output. No tidy lesson; ambiguity lingers (mines still failing), yet the cost of dissonance—and its remedy—is made undeniable through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exquisitely controlled: Sava notices sound textures others miss (“dull ring,” “too high like a warning bird”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—longer sentences for patience, staccato beats for cracked tiles. No head-hopping; even group scenes stay anchored in Sava/Mara’s sensory frame. Diction is voice-motivated (“black as drowned wood,” “frozen river” of cobblestones)—lyric but precise, never ornamental.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is consistent (acoustic metaphors) and payoff-driven—the fork’s hum evolves from diagnostic tool to communal conductor. Zero paraphrase loops; syntax varies purposefully (fragments for impact, flowing clauses for ritual). Final line (“shared balance restored”) resonates without overstatement, echoing the opening’s hush with earned warmth.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms the “saving a town” trope through acoustic physics and ritualized walking—fresh, specific, and inevitable in hindsight. The tuning fork isn’t magical; its power derives from human coordination. Bold risk: resolving political threat through collective rhythm, not argument or force. Vision is singular—sound as social glue—and fully committed, with no retreat into realism or sentimentality.</comment>
