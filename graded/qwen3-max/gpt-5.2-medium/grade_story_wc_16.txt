<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “carefully reckless” trait manifests in micro-choices (hiding the codex, arranging the ritual) that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her contradiction—desire to protect vs. need for trust—is active in-scene, not summarized. Ilyon’s gray-eyed silence and the team’s “careful distance” function as crucibles that force her final renunciation of secrecy. The cost—reputation, mentorship, isolation—is felt throughout and crystallizes in her handing over the ink well.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the symphony resolves not by erasing lies but by redefining promises as connective tissue, with visible relational cost. The causal chain is tight—Mara’s secrecy → broken trust → ritual requiring interconnected vows—and every beat links via “because/therefore.” The ink well’s transformation from clear to midnight and back mirrors the emotional arc with physical stakes. Orientation is immediate (“last summer storm… Extinct Language Archive”) and never wavers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The archive functions as micro-setting: cedar oil smell, cold quartz lamp, and sealed cabinet constrain action and charge the final image. The glass ink well—a tool-as-setting—directly enables the climax and reweights meaning when handed to Ilyon. Sensory detail (rain on coats, vibrating lamps) is selective, urgent, and filtered through Mara’s linguist POV. Weather and spatial choreography (vault as “heart”) cohere without clutter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring trust through truth—tightens decisively when Mara risks reputation to confess via the codex’s symphony. The deepening occurs when the music exposes not just her lie but Ilyon’s complicity, raising relational cost. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her vow-keeping, note-sending, and quill-tracing narrow options until only shared vulnerability remains. The price—shame, exposed betrayal—is unmistakable in the discord that “stung each listener.”</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: trust isn’t absence of secrecy but active, braided promise-making. The codex’s true function—erasing spaces between promises—offers a non-literal answer to the central question of how silence corrodes connection. Subtext thrives in silence, ink-darkening, and dissonant chords; no moralizing intrudes. Final image—the “tentative melody of truth”—reweights all prior silence as recoverable through ongoing practice, not perfection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is single, stable, and deeply idiosyncratic: Mara perceives scripts as musical scores, truths as harmonies. Voice modulates under pressure—syntax tightens during ritual (“She dipped a quill… began tracing”), then expands into lyrical resolution. Dialogue is sparse but distinct: pledges are plain, Ilyon’s Sava admission carries weight through linguistic rarity. No head-hopping; even group reactions are filtered through Mara’s “careful” observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “trust drained away like ink in water” fuses metaphor with causality. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully—short staccato beats during tension (“Rain on their coats”), flowing clauses for revelation. Zero paraphrase loops; every image (snarled script, tuning fork) pulls double duty. Minor deduction for one slightly ornate phrase (“cautious exuberance”) that edges toward label-speak, though immediately grounded in action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise transforms tropes: the “lost codex” becomes a test of communal truth-telling, not individual decoding. Originality lies in mechanics—interconnected promises as literal conduit—and emotional specificity (fear of name-erasure as metaphor for academic erasure). Risk-taking (ritual as climax) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular: linguistics as ethical practice, silence as active betrayal.</comment>
