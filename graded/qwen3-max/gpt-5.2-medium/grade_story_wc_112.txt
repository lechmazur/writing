<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her mechanical warmth, professional restraint, and quiet urgency shape every choice. Her contradiction (obliging yet decisive) manifests in scene: she acts without debate but demands agency over the wind rigs. The final renunciation—refusing Sen’s grand theory for station integrity—is earned by her established ethos and carries visible cost: she accepts responsibility for sideways time as a “toolbox,” not a revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: time’s sideways nature isn’t disproven but reweighted as ethical burden, not scientific triumph. The nexus lever pull triggers cascading consequences (vision of broken rotor, glider panic), and Mara’s repair enacts a chosen past that stabilizes the present—causality holds under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Textural dominant at closure). Cost is legible: the station survives only because Mara forecloses Sen’s data-driven ambition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The xenobiology station functions as micro-setting: frost-filmed dome, icy-warm corridors, and radiator grids establish tactile specificity. Crucially, the magnetic nexus and wind rigs constrain choices—the rotor’s failure threatens the aviary, forcing Mara’s rooftop intervention. Final image charges the setting: repaired rotor, sleeping gliders, and neutralized nexus make the station’s fragile equilibrium feel earned, not decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—station integrity vs. temporal discovery—is signaled early and tightens when Mara sees the pre-broken rotor. Her agency drives escalation: she leverages holographic principles not for data but repair, altering tactics under pressure. Cost is unmistakable: she trades Sen’s theoretical breakthrough for physical safety, crystallizing her stance that tools demand responsibility—a trade-off with emotional and professional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: time as ethical instrument, not metaphysical spectacle. The final line—“time resumed forward motion while keeping its sideways secrets”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to Sen’s desire, reweighting the entire premise. No moralizing; insight arises from Mara’s wrench-click repair and Sen’s silent acknowledgment of “warmth” from circuits. Complexity endures: sideways time exists but must be handled like live wiring.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful: Mara notices stress fractures, magnetic gooseflesh, and ventilation echoes, filtering everything through mechanic’s pragmatism. Syntax modulates under pressure—longer, lyrical sentences during observation; clipped focus during repair. Zero head-hopping; single POV remains taut. Voice never slips into exposition or diagnostic labels, even at peak tension (“tasted the word like cold tea” avoids therapy-speak).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is precise (“lung holding its breath,” “magnetism trying to write in her bones”) without muddle. No loops or scaffold—each image serves causality (e.g., “cracked rotor blade” vision directly motivates rooftop climb). Final paragraph’s cadence shift (“time resumed forward motion…”) delivers closure with rhythmic inevitability.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise transforms sci-fi tropes through specificity: time manipulation isn’t weaponized or worshipped but treated as faulty machinery requiring calibration. Mara’s role as “obliging sky mechanic” subverts the genius-scientist trope, grounding high-concept physics in grease-stained gloves. Risk-taking (sideways time as repair tool) heightens stakes without gimmickry; the nexus’s rules feel discovered, not imposed. Vision of pre-broken rotor is fresh, inevitable, and irreplaceable.</comment>
