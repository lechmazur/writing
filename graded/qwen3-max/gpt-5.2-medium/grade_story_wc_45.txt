<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rowan’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his skepticism fractures not into belief but responsibility, and his micro-choices (tearing the death note, examining joints, reaching for his satchel) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The girl’s “shrewdly innocent” candor mirrors Lina’s earlier curiosity, creating credible ambiguity without caricature. His flaw—dismissing strangeness as trauma—directly enables the central mystery and is confronted through action, not epiphany. The final choice to step through the hedge door is earned by prior causality and carries emotional and conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Rowan’s decision to enter the hedge door crystallizes options, reconfigures meaning (“navigate by what we get wrong”), and carries undeniable cost—abandoning official closure for uncertain truth. The Causal lens holds: each discovery (notebook, tooth, tin box) motivates the next move, culminating in a decisive act. The healed collarbone and twig splints provide motivated ellipsis that tightens rather than resolves. Cost is legible in the final image—tying the tooth to the star map—as a reweighting of error into guidance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The secret garden functions as micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: its sundials, roses, and hidden tin box shape Rowan’s search and reflect thematic tension between nostalgia and innovation. Sensory detail is purposeful—crushed mint, silent electric pump, rain-swollen notebook—and filtered through Rowan’s bone-setter POV (noticing grafts, wrist angles). Spatial choreography remains coherent from maze to riverbank to garden center. The recurring hedge maze and living branch door directly charge the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus closure—is signaled early and deepens when Rowan realizes Lina was apprenticing in secret, transforming grief into active responsibility. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: his bone-setting expertise drives every key turn (identifying the substitute’s healed fracture, resetting the girl’s jaw). The cost is unmistakable: abandoning professional certainty for folkloric ambiguity, with social and emotional risk. Coincidence never resolves; every complication arises from prior choices or concealed knowledge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: grafting roses, setting bones, mapping errors as constellations—all coalesce into the idea that mistakes can guide if attended to with care. Subtext operates through silence (the gap where a tooth should be), gesture (Rowan touching the jawline), and charged objects (the tooth tied to the map). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: truth isn’t found by discarding error but by navigating it. No moralizing; complexity endures—changeling or traumatized child, both suffer in “our maze of fears.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Rowan notices joints, graft unions, pulse rhythms—his voice modulates from clinical detachment to tender focus without losing specificity. Syntax varies purposefully: short, tactile sentences during examination (“He touched her jawline”) contrast with lyrical density in reflection (“yearning for a fact that would not bruise anyone”). No head-hopping; single POV maintained with controlled psychic distance. Elision is taught early (substitute body found off-page) and paid off through embodied discovery, not exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density: “healed collarbone set perfectly, the way Rowan sets bones” conveys expertise, dread, and uncanny familiarity in one clause. Rhythm accelerates during examination beats, breathes in garden moments; sentence openings vary naturally. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances character, plot, or atmosphere. Figurative language is precise (“eyes bright as polished seeds,” “cleft in certainty”) and never muddles peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms changeling folklore through the specific lens of medical ethics and grief—Lina’s apprenticeship reframes mimicry as learning, substitution as pedagogy. The synthesis of bone setting, star maps, and hybrid roses feels inevitable in hindsight yet freshly imagined. Bold risk: making the climax a quiet jaw adjustment, not a rescue. Originality lies in emotional specificity—Rowan’s forgiveness isn’t mystical but professional: he treats the symptom because suffering is real regardless of origin.</comment>
