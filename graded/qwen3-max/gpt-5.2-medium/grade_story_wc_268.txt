<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orun’s contradictions—diminutive yet titanic, smiling yet resolute—are embodied in micro-choices (e.g., pressing inked thumb to mosaic) that reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over power. His refusal of the crown is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (returning to ruins). No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are tactile (“dust falling in veils,” “tugged at his bones”). Interiority remains concrete and consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Orun renounces the throne, foreclosing personal power with tangible cost. The causal lens holds—each beat follows because/therefore logic (ink pellet → rune → drift → ledger). Cost is legible in the final image: “walked back toward the temple's ruins.” Orientation is immediate and functional disorientation (time dilation) pays off thematically at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The library isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains and enables: shelves slide via rune, constellations shift time, mosaic hides proof. The iron gall ink pellet functions as micro-setting, shaping tactics. Final collapse (“shelves leaning like courtiers bowing out”) charges the ending. Sensory detail is selective, POV-filtered (archivist notices marginalia, vellum texture), never touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unmasking the pretender—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Orun copies the ledger as the library collapses, sacrificing preservation for truth. Agency drives escalation: his choices (dissolving pellet, sundering star) narrow options and raise cost. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his archivist skill and moral clarity under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme—truth as fragile, cryptic, and archival—emerges through action, not assertion. The final image reweights everything: Orun leaves truth as “cryptic messages for the next age,” rejecting spectacle for stewardship. No moralizing; resonance accrues via recurring objects (ink, mosaic, books). Complexity is preserved: victory is quiet, justice deferred, power refused.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: lyrical but precise, archivist-poetic (“dust fell in slow arcs like collapsed prayers”). Syntax modulates with pressure—longer cadences in discovery, tighter phrasing at climax (“pressed his inked thumb... careful heave”). POV is stable, perceptually biased (notices marginalia, seal cracks). No head-hopping; diction stays within Orun’s plausible lexicon even in elevated moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line does multiple jobs (e.g., “regally unpretentious in a linen sash” establishes status, trait, and contrast to armor). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent (prayers→dust→veils; constellations→seasons→time). Minor deduction: one slightly overloaded sentence near climax (“the heavens above the broken oculus paused...”), but clarity holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Ingenuity lies in synthesizing archivist tropes with mythic stakes via specific mechanics: truth is accessed through bibliographic forensics, not swordplay. The “rune of drift” transforms magical realism into epistemological tool. Risk-taking (quiet climax, no battle) heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular—no template echoes; every element serves character and concept.</comment>
