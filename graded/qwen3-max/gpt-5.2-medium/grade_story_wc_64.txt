<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The gardener’s interiority is vividly embodied—dirt under nails, humming while trimming yew—and his micro-choices (decoding threads, planting the sapling) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in sheltering others. Alvera’s presence applies immediate pressure without flattening her into a mere prompt; her grief and question (“love or fear?”) force a morally weighted interpretation. The final renunciation isn’t of action but of ambiguity: he affirms Tomas’s intent with certainty, bearing the cost of that clarity. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through tactile detail and restrained lyricism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the gardener endures the weight of unspoken histories and chooses to affirm Tomas’s purpose, foreclosing doubt with visible cost (the ledger buried, the case returned). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens through sensory density (smoke-lavender tapestry, velveteen gloom) until the final image reweights silence as shelter, not absence. Anchors are clear by line 30; no orientation debt. Cost is legible in “names listed tenderly organized”—a quiet monument to resistance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The cobalt silo isn’t backdrop but crucible: its sound-swallowing walls enable covert communication, and its repurposing (salt storage vs. refugee haven) charges every object within. The sovereign case, chess clock, and tapestry function as micro-settings that constrain knowledge and action. Final image—planting an ash sapling under the “star-cold roofline”—transforms the silo from shroud to velvet, proving environment shapes closure. Sensory hierarchy (click of rook, breath before confession) filters through the gardener’s professional attunement to “uncharted echoes.”</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering the shape of Tomas’s intentions—tightens when the green thread reveals a cipher, shifting from emotional curiosity to moral imperative. The gardener’s agency drives escalation: he decodes, interprets, digs, and plants. Cost is felt in Alvera’s sharpened gaze and the ledger’s oilcloth-wrapped fragility—proof that truth requires tending. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from embodied attention to frayed threads and frozen chess pieces.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme—how love manifests as protection through meticulous, hidden acts—emerges via particulars: stitched maps, salt ledgers, clocks as cover. The final image reweights silence: not emptiness but deliberate shelter. No moralizing; resonance accrues through the gardener’s actions (planting ash where ledger was buried) and the tapestry’s star-mapped border. Ambiguity lingers (Was Tomas afraid? Yes. Did he act from love? Also yes)—complexity without false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is flawlessly controlled: perception filtered through a gardener’s tactile lexicon (“dirt under nails,” “count colors the way I count graves”). Syntax modulates with pressure—longer, lyrical sentences in reflection; clipped clauses during decoding (“A black thread loops… disappears into blue”). No head-hopping; Alvera’s dialogue carries distinct rhythm (“her husband died midgame…”) without convergence. Voice remains singular even in shared silence; diction never drifts beyond plausible working-class lyricism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence layers atmosphere, character, and plot (“joy is easier to carry than the headstones' dates”). Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors cohere (velvet/velveteen, roots/branches, tapestry/stars). Final paragraph’s cadence—“night feels less like a shroud and more like velvet”—resolves the opening’s “quieter than prayer” with earned softness. Minor deduction only for one slightly ornate phrase (“statue rubbed warm”), but it serves Alvera’s transformation without muddling clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cemetery gardener as decoder of silent resistance, chess as espionage cover, tapestry as encrypted ledger. Tropes (widow’s quest, hidden messages) are grounded in specific historical texture (refugees, salt ledgers). The cobalt silo’s dual use feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk: prioritizing accumulative texture over causal plot, yet tension never slackens. Vision is singular—quiet heroism encoded in horticulture and handicraft—without gimmickry.</comment>
