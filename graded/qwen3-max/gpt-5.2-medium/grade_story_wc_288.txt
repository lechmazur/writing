<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s guilt, embodied through visceral memory of the moa and tactile interaction with the sundial, drives every micro-choice without therapy-speak. Their shift from resurrection to coexistence is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. The curator functions as minimal but effective secondary pressure, not a crucible, which fits scope. Interior contradiction—between isolation as refuge and independence as responsibility—is sustained in-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “coexist with the living world without needing it to forgive me” reweights the entire premise with undeniable emotional cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds via sensory density (vapor cycles, hum, light-script) culminating in a resonant final image. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty. Cost is legible in the wrinkled yet meaningful pages and relinquished sundial.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Tidal Library and stone circle are not backdrop but active constraints: vapor cycles dictate timing, cloud bridges shape access, lichen-buried pillars obscure knowledge. The brass sundial functions as micro-setting—its atomically reflective inscription enables the climax. Final image charges the tool-turned-legacy (ordinary ink, error-prone) against the immortal artifact. Sensory hierarchy shifts appropriately from humid library to vibrating stone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—is signaled early and deepens when the sundial reveals names of extinct pairs, forcing confrontation with past complicity. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to speak aloud rewrites the script into actionable instructions. Cost is unmistakable: abandoning perfect memory (“letting errors show”) to embrace fragile, mortal utility. Coincidence never resolves; the hum responds only to breath and speech.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the moa bones, curled catalog cards, unreadable tally marks—not abstraction. The final non-literal answer (“keep the hum in my bones”) reweights isolation as spacing rather than separation, rejecting resurrection for reciprocal presence. No moralizing; resonance accrues through recurring images (light, vapor, brittle awakenings) that shift meaning. Complexity remains: guilt persists, but action becomes possible without absolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable, perceptually specific (“vapor… wetting the stacks until the catalog cards curled”), and modulates rhythm under pressure (short clauses during hum revelation). Voice is lyric but controlled—no head-hopping, no register drift. Elision is purposeful (reincarnation backstory compressed into one potent sentence) and pays off in closure. Diction (“brittle awakenings,” “pale surf”) reflects character’s scholarly yet haunted interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“the library collected tides and languages, but not the sounds that made them”) and varied syntax. Minor overwriting in “atomically reflective, as if each groove held its own mirror”—slightly strained metaphor—but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final paragraph’s wrinkled pages crystallize theme without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise transforms reincarnation tropes via ecological grief and linguistic archaeology. Sundial-as-key, tidal library, and stone-circle instrument feel freshly synthesized, not checklist-fantasy. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure, abstract stakes grounded in moss and brass) heightens meaning without gimmickry. Emotional specificity—guilt over moa extinction—anchors universal themes in irreplaceable particulars.</comment>
