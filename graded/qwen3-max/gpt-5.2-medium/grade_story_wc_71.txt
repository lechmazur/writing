<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is exquisitely concrete—her noticing is both profession and pathology, embodied in micro-choices like returning a teaspoon to its saucer. Her motivation (to understand aliveness in houses) drives every action and culminates in a renunciation (releasing the orris shard) that forecloses her private ritual but enables communal belonging. The final line—“move nothing without listening”—is earned through repeated tactile corrections and carries the cost of relinquishing control. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in pulse, floorboards, and scent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Mara redefines “aliveness” not as magic but as attention, crystallized when she releases the orris root and the hush spreads. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pressure builds via displaced objects, cadence shifts with storm and lanternlight, and the dominant stake (restoring homes’ self-recognition) tightens meaningfully. Cost is legible: Mara surrenders her compass-object, trading personal insight for collective warmth. Orientation is immediate (“quiet bay in spring,” “Mara walked”), and causality flows from sensory cues to thematic revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The quiet bay isn’t backdrop but active constraint: saltgrass, tide lines, and bay winds shape tactics (e.g., wind moans when clock is misplaced). The orris shard functions as micro-setting—its weight guides Mara’s choices and charges the final image when sanctified with saltwater. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara’s perfumer-adjacent perception: violets, radiator hum, plaster warmth. Every detail serves the central question of aliveness, avoiding white-room syndrome or generic spring tropes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether a house can “recognize itself”—is signaled early and deepens when the storm forces communal gathering. Mara’s agency (sanctifying via object-placement) narrows options: moving the clock drains warmth, proving attention is fragile. Cost is visible—she abandons her solitary cataloging rule for communal restoration—and the storm escalation tests her theory under pressure. Coincidence (power outage) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution comes from Mara’s deliberate acts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: displaced objects as “missing words,” aliveness as conversational continuity among belongings. Final image—hush spreading “softening even the arguments that would come later”—offers non-literal answer: belonging is quiet, collective attention. Avoids moralizing; Mara’s line “A house lives when it can recognize itself” lands as earned insight, not prompt-thesis. Subtext thrives in silence, scent, and the child’s whale finding its sill.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: Mara notices latches, wall-scars, and radiator hums with a cataloger’s precision inflected by poetic intuition. Syntax modulates—long, lyrical sentences for reflection; short clauses for action (“She carried the orris shard back”). Voice remains consistent even in elevated diction (“hushed blaze,” “compact quiet”) because it’s character-bound. No head-hopping; single POV holds tightly, and free indirect style merges observation with yearning seamlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “streetlights daydream,” “hush slid into her palm,” “floorboards softened underfoot” all advance atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence propels. Figurative language is coherent—hush as “kindling for a fire that made no smoke”—and never muddles causality. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors tide ebb, and saltwater sanctification ties closure to opening bay imagery without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms “haunted house” trope into a meditation on domestic attention, using perfumery logic (orris fixes scent) to literalize emotional residue. The “creeping normality noticer” archetype gains specificity through Harbor Estate Service and displaced-object rituals. Risk-taking (lyric structure, conceptual hush) heightens stakes without gimmickry; every choice feels inevitable in hindsight. Fresh synthesis: urban loneliness healed not by people but by things remembering their places.</comment>
