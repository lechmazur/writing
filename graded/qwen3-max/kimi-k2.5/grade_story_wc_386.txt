<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—salvaging purity from historical wreckage—is rooted in consistent, embodied traits and deepens under pressure. Her internal conflict between truth and fragility manifests in micro-choices: withholding the child’s survival, handling the snow globe with reverence. The ghost interaction reveals contradictory impulses—duty vs. mercy—without tidy resolution. Final renunciation (weaving truth carefully) is earned through prior causality and carries visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the wreck is reframed not as tragedy but redemption, with undeniable social cost—the dismantling of a decades-old lie. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout; dream cameos build density until the captain’s hesitation crystallizes the truth. Cost is legible in Elara’s exhaustion and the shrine’s guttering candles. Every beat tightens around the snow globe’s revelation, culminating in Charged Poise at the final writing gesture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glacier shrine functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges every choice: cold preserves ghosts, ice walls reflect borrowed starlight, candles mark fragile human presence against eternal ice. The snow globe—a recurring object—evolves from artifact to vessel of paternal love, directly shaping the climax. Sensory detail (mist-breath, phantom seawater, salt-stained glass) is filtered through Elara’s professional and emotional priorities. Final image of warped glass “cradling the toy in eternal embrace” reweights the entire setting as sacred archive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—exposing the Sovereign’s true fate—is signaled early and escalates through Elara’s agency: interpreting dreams, confronting the ghost, choosing how much truth to reveal. The meaningful tightening occurs when she withholds the child’s survival, forcing the ghost’s hesitation and opening the “window of connection.” Cost is unmistakable: mental exhaustion, invasion of strangers’ subconscious, and the burden of translating ghost-silence into bearable truth. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens without reliance on coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of objects, actions, and silence: truth as something fragile that must be woven, not declared. The snow globe’s transformation—from child’s toy to vessel of sacrifice—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: can purity survive institutional corruption? Subtext operates in gesture (Elara’s careful pen dip) and image (candles as borrowed stars). No moralizing; resonance accrues through specificity, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exquisitely controlled: Elara notices what a wreck-diver ghost whisperer would—salt stains like tear tracks, phantom seawater, the texture of warped glass. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer, lyrical sentences during reflection; tighter phrasing during confrontation (“You cannot salvage what the ocean has claimed”). Voice remains consistent, with no head-hopping or register drift. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors glacial stillness, proving prose-as-character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line: “salt stains like tear tracks,” “voice like cracking ice,” “glass having flowed like water to cradle the toy.” No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful—no mixed metaphors. Minor deduction for slight overuse of “woven” motifs, but closure remains sharp and unblurred.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fusion of maritime ghost story, dream archaeology, and forensic empathy. The “windows of connection” concept transforms standard ghost tropes into a method with emotional and epistemological stakes. Risk-taking—centering truth as fragile craft rather than revelation—heightens thematic coherence. Every element feels inevitable in hindsight, especially the snow globe’s dual role as evidence and relic. No derivative echoes; vision is singular and committed.</comment>
