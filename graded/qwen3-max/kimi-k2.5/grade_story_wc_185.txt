<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is consistent and embodied—her tactile engagement with maps, ice, and stone reveals a character defined by precision and sensory attunement. Her internal conflict (endurance vs. agency) culminates in the earned choice to conjure silence herself, foreclosing passive waiting with visible cost: exhaustion, isolation, and ongoing vigilance. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through physical sensation (“trapped bees,” “hammered repose”). The final renunciation of rest-as-escape in favor of tending the silence is credible and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara’s endurance crystallizes into active guardianship, with the cost legible in her exhaustion and the sealed ice recording “victory.” The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—pressure builds via sensory density and pattern shifts (cracks, glow, silence), not causality. Orientation is immediate and functional. The bloom of hush reconfigures the world’s stakes without mechanical resolution, satisfying Conceptual Repricing through tangible consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The harmonic caves function as micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: stalactites hum in D-minor, rivers provide percussion, and the echo chamber stone stores acoustic memory. Every environmental detail serves the central conflict—bioluminescence guides, ice cracks diagnose, resonance dictates tactics. The final image of the stone’s steady pulse charges closure, proving the setting is not backdrop but co-agent. Sensory hierarchy aligns with crisis: sound dominates early, then silence becomes tactile (“beaten copper”).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—quiet as survival—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes she must *conjure* rather than find the bloom of hush. The tightening occurs at the hairline fracture, which forces her shift from observation to action. Cost is unmistakable: her body as instrument, her breath as resource, her future bound to vigilance. Escalation is driven by her agency under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence, and the final stillness carries the weight of sustained effort.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through precise particulars: silence as crafted resistance, not absence. The “hammered repose” reweights chaos as conquerable through discipline and geometry, not force. Final image—Mara resting beside the pulsing stone—offers a non-literal answer: peace requires maintenance, not miracles. No moralizing; resonance accrues via recurring motifs (ripples, cracks, bloom) that evolve from diagnostic tools to emblems of victory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Mara notices interference patterns, harmonic shifts, and fracture runes—her world filtered through acoustic expertise. Prose rhythm modulates with pressure: longer, fluid sentences during mapping; clipped intensity during singing. Voice remains consistent in elevated diction (“tempest of light,” “null-song”) because it’s character-bound, not imposed. No head-hopping; single POV is controlled, with psychic distance tightening as stakes rise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“bloom of hush,” “hammered repose”) and pays off without muddle. Minor overwriting in “screaming tempest of light and static” slightly strains, but peak beats avoid purple prose. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies purposefully. Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the earned calm, proving line-level control serves thematic closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms apocalypse tropes through acoustic specificity: invaders are frequency-based, salvation is sonic negation. The “ripple-mark mapkeeper” and “bloom of hush” feel inevitable yet fresh, grounded in tangible craft. Risk-taking (silence as active force, caves as living instrument) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision is singular—physics of sound as both weapon and balm—and fully committed, yielding a premise that couldn’t be transplanted without collapse.</comment>
