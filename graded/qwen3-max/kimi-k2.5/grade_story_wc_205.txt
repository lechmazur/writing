<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interiority is vividly embodied—his sorrow, poetic bias, and reconfigured revolutionary zeal manifest through micro-choices (e.g., refusing to cover mirrors, weeping at the shard). His motivation evolves from fossilized guilt to active custodianship, with clear cost: abandoning conquest for elegy. Contradictory impulses—defunct fighter vs. tender archaeologist—act simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation feels earned, not epiphanic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kaelen’s shift from insurgency to custodianship crystallizes as he covers mirrors “from the poetry of the gesture,” foreclosing his old path with visible emotional cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through storms, shard resonance, and mirror logic until the final image reweights everything. Cost is legible in “for the first time since the revolution's failure, he wept.” Orientation is swift and functional disorientation serves closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid functions as micro-setting: its architecture directly constrains choices (mirrors must be covered; ornamentation acts as temporal valves) and charges the final image (“tending the visible time”). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—amber time, singing shard, molten honey rivers—all reflecting Kaelen’s poetic reverence. The environment isn’t backdrop but active participant in thematic and tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to interpret the asteroid’s civilization—tightens when Kaelen defies Voss and uncovers mirrors, risking madness to prove memory over domination. His agency drives escalation: three storms of observation culminate in demonstrable proof that reshapes the council’s stance. Cost is felt in his isolation, tears, and permanent stay—renouncing departure to become custodian. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: time as trust, not territory; revolution as repetition of ancient error. The crystal shard’s poetry reframes covering mirrors as modesty, not fear—subverting superstition into ethics. Final image offers non-literal answer: history rewritten “into something tender” via elegy, not seizure. No moralizing; resonance arises from Kaelen’s actions and the shard’s silent testimony.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is unmistakable: Kaelen notices time as amber wine, architecture as gilt chronology, storms as screams. Syntax modulates with intensity—long, lyrical sentences for reflection; sharper fragments during storm demonstrations. Voice remains consistent, elevated yet grounded in his poetic worldview. No head-hopping; single POV executed with rhythmic control and purposeful compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense but clear, each sentence advancing character, theme, or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“visible time pooled like amber wine”) and pays off (“river of molten honey”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Minor risk: “burnished sorrow” borders on abstraction, but it’s anchored in voice and paid off in the council scene and final weeping.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis: time as visible, fragile substance requiring apology, not control. The baroque asteroid as reliquary, revolution as tragic repetition—fresh inflections grounded in specific logic. Bold risk: treating archaeology as moral reckoning, not empirical dispute. Vision feels singular, not templated; every element serves the core question of how to witness rather than conquer.</comment>
