<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through her perceptual idiosyncrasies—her noticing of “creeping normality” isn’t abstract but embodied in micro-choices (trailing fingers on fence posts, pressing orris root to siding). Her motivation—to understand why houses feel alive—is dramatized through action, not declaration, and culminates in a credible endurance that forecloses passive observation: she becomes a participant, consecrating the boundary between architecture and entity. The cost is felt in the cottage’s shiver of recognition and the altered configuration of objects, implying irreversible entanglement. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through sensory precision and restrained gesture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the houses aren’t haunted but listening, and Maya’s attention catalyzes their consciousness—a reweighting of the story’s entire premise with conceptual cost (she can never unsee this aliveness). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds from first line to last; pattern coalesces like “salt forming on glass,” and the final image of the cottage’s “hushed blaze” makes the cost undeniable. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“Maya,” “quiet bay in spring,” “seawall”), and every displaced object serves the escalating grammar of rearrangement. The shard of hush crystallizes the before/after without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The quiet bay in spring isn’t backdrop but active crucible: lilacs blooming “too thickly for April,” tide clocks running backward, and sound-collecting bungalows constrain Maya’s method and charge the final image. Recurring objects—driftwood fence posts, orris root, displaced furniture—function as micro-settings that guide choice and accumulate pressure. Sensory hierarchy reflects Maya’s priorities (tactile wood, violet scent, visual light shifts), avoiding tourist cataloging. The blue cottage’s siding exhaling and foundation yielding a “shard of hush” ties environment directly to closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding architectural sentience—is signaled early and deepens into participatory witness, narrowing options from observer to co-creator. The tightening occurs when Maya places the orris root beside the crystalline silence, an act of inadvertent sanctification that reweights all prior noticing. Cost is legible: the houses awaken more fully because of her, altering their behavior (“fence posts would have moved again”) and implicating her in their ongoing conversation. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, with no coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: aliveness as accumulation of quiet moments, not intrusion. The final image—the cottage glowing with “hushed blaze”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to why houses feel alive, reweighting every displaced spoon and migrating book as acts of attention. Subtext operates through gesture (kneeling, placing shards) and implication, avoiding moralizing. The insight—that profound truths arrive as “creeping adjustments to the normal world”—is earned through concrete discovery, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is singular and rhythmically controlled: syntax mirrors Maya’s attunement (long, observant sentences punctuated by crisp realizations). Perceptual signature is character-specific (“streetlights daydreamed,” “shadows pooled differently in rooms that breathed”). No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained (inference reads as inference). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“grammar of rearrangement,” “sponges saturated with hush”) and pays off at closure without register drift or overwriting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“chairs inching toward windows, books migrating south”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (houses as sponges, silence as crystal). Sentence openings vary naturally, paragraph lengths create visual rhythm, and the final line (“continuing their slow conversation with the tide”) recharges the opening’s seawall imagery. Minor deduction only for one slightly ornate phrase (“primordial stillness that had learned to want”) that borders on abstraction but doesn’t obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Originality lies in the synthesis: architectural sentience framed not as haunting but as accumulated attention, with displaced objects as ears. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, grounded in Maya’s method and the bay’s rules. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure, personified setting) heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Every detail—orrice root, backward tide clocks, streetlight daydreams—is irreplaceable and coheres into a singular vision that avoids tropes.</comment>
