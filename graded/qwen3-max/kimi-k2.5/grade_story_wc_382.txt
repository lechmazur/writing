<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tactile interrogation of architecture reveals a yearning for connection with the inanimate, while Elias’s spectral presence forces micro-choices (borrowing sugar, pressing seals) that carry emotional and ontological cost. Their unspoken pact around “agreed upon lies” deepens character through restraint rather than exposition. The final act—pressing her own seal—shows credible endurance that forecloses a purely rational worldview, accepting haunting as fluency. Flawlessly avoids diagnostic self-awareness; emotion lives in fingers, bricks, and meteor light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Maya’s integration into the building’s “vocabulary” reweights the entire premise—architecture isn’t just speaking; it demands co-authorship. The cost is legible in her surrender to mystery (“pretend you are merely repairing plaster while actually reading the cracks”) and Elias’s unacknowledged death. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds via sensory density (grooves like teeth, radiators humming dead tongues) until the rooftop copper flashing accepts her name. Every beat tightens the grammar of haunting without causal over-explanation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The Art Deco building functions as active setting—its crown molding, pipes, and cornice brackets constrain Maya’s choices and charge the climax. The rooftop garden isn’t backdrop but crucible: meteor showers sync with linguistic breakthroughs, lavender and jasmine frame spectral communion. Crucially, the copper flashing in the final image receives her seal, making environment causally active. Sensory detail (warm concrete, cool brass) is selective, urgent, and POV-filtered—no white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning the language of old buildings—is signaled early and deepens through weekly rituals that narrow Maya’s reality toward the spectral. The tightening occurs when she accepts Elias’s death without naming it, trading empirical certainty for architectural fluency. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits conventional sanity (“seeming mad”) to gain communion. Agency drives escalation—she initiates sugar-borrowing, brings her own seal—and the meteor shower’s cosmic rhythm doesn’t resolve but refracts pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: truth requires “agreed upon lies,” and understanding demands complicity with silence. The desk seals don’t explain but enact this—impressions reveal “structural confessions” only when pressed with ritual pretense. Final image reweights everything: Maya’s name in mortar isn’t stated moral but resonant fact, earned through tactile apprenticeship. Avoids sentimentality by grounding epiphany in craft—calligraphy, trowel-traced blueprints—not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable, intimate, and perceptually distinct—Maya notices architectural “dialects,” not people. Voice modulates under pressure: early lyrical density (“grooves that seemed almost alphabetical”) sharpens to precise action (“pressed it beside Elias’s”). Elias’s dialogue carries idiosyncratic authority (“extinct alphabets… centuries to practice”), never converging with Maya’s internal rhythm. No head-hopping; even shared moments remain filtered through her longing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“pipes gurgle their questions”). Figurative language is coherent: architecture as palimpsest, meteors as translators. Minor overwriting in “patiently nimble” repetition (three uses) slightly dulls uniqueness, but closure remains sharp. No loops or scaffolding; syntax varies naturally, especially in high-pressure beats like the final sealing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: haunting as linguistic pedagogy, where buildings are grammatical entities requiring calligraphic interpretation. Transforms tropes (ghost tutor, sentient architecture) through specific craft—Etruscan on seed packets, carnelian seals matching facade symbols. Risk-taking (unacknowledged death, sugar-borrowing as ritual) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight: every meteor shower aligns with syntactic revelation.</comment>
