<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—her grief, professional restraint, and moral urgency coalesce in micro-choices like photographing dust patterns before cleaning. Her contradictory impulses (duty vs. preservation, despair vs. hope) act simultaneously, not abstractly. The sergeant’s off-page presence functions as a catalytic ghost, not a character, preserving single-POV integrity. Final renunciation of bureaucratic indifference is earned through tactile, embodied acts, not epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the file room transforms from mausoleum to “secret library of accumulated care,” with cost legible in Maya’s redefined archival practice. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—dust patterns function as narrative syntax, escalating via the anomaly (Jericho’s file) to thematic revelation. Orientation is immediate (“gray film coating the metal shelving”), and the final image (button as method) reweights all prior silence. No causality breaks; every beat tightens the thematic coil.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The foster care file room operates as micro-setting that constrains and enables: dust gradients dictate Maya’s search logic, shelves choreograph her movements, and manila folders become monuments. The brass button—a recurring object—charges the final image by embodying “love that outlasted its own utility.” Sensory detail (brittle creases, gray film) is filtered through Maya’s archivist POV, never touristic. Setting directly shapes the climax: without dust as evidence, the sergeant’s returns vanish.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether small kindnesses matter when unwitnessed—is signaled early and deepened through Maya’s discovery of the button pattern. Escalation is driven by her agency: she cross-references files, compiles an index, photographs dust. Cost is felt in her redefined labor (cleaning only after documentation) and emotional shift from broken-hearted to “examined conviction.” The sergeant’s off-stage pressure is coherent; coincidence (dust anomaly) complicates but doesn’t resolve—Maya’s choices do.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: dust as witness, buttons as proof, files as contested terrain. The ending offers a non-literal answer—“small kindnesses... could unfurl across time”—via Maya’s pocketed button-as-method, reweighting institutional silence as fertile ground. Avoids moralizing; subtext lives in tactile details (fossilized creases, circular clearings). Central question (“Do unseen mercies matter?”) is answered through action, not assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose embodies Maya’s perceptual signature: historian-meets-archivist diction (“geological strata,” “manila monuments”) modulates under pressure into lyrical precision (“love that outlasted its own utility”). Syntax varies purposefully—long, layered sentences for reflection; short, clean clauses for discovery. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained (she infers the sergeant’s actions, never accesses his mind). Voice remains consistent even in elevated moments, avoiding register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density: “dust fell in gradients” conveys setting, character, and theme in five words. Minor overwriting in “tactfully hopeful precision of an archaeologist” slightly dilutes immediacy, but figurative language remains coherent (dust as strata, files as monuments). No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s rhythm accelerates then resolves cleanly, matching Maya’s emotional arc. One near-redundancy (“submerged mercies” / “hidden humanities”) costs 0.3.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms bureaucratic archive tropes through specific, grounded choices: dust as forensic evidence, military buttons as anti-institutional tokens. The synthesis of archival science and emotional archaeology feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking (making absence palpable via dust patterns) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise avoids sentimentality by rooting hope in procedural rebellion—Maya’s index is both practical and poetic.</comment>
