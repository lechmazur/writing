<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation—recovering lost memories—is rooted in trauma and rendered through concrete, embodied choices: her trembling hands, the coffee divination, urgent excavation. Her internal contradiction (hope vs. dread) manifests simultaneously in action and perception. The final revelation is earned by prior causality: the whale’s beaching, her nightly vigilance, the chamber’s logic. Cost is felt in the weight of recovered grief, not just sentiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: deletion is migration, not erasure. The whale’s sacrifice reweights the entire premise with emotional and metaphysical cost. Orientation is immediate (“dock-side lantern lighter,” “beneath the abandoned docks”), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via sensory layering and gravity shifts until the final image crystallizes meaning. No causality breaks; every detail serves the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains movement (gravity pockets), guides navigation (coffee grounds), and preserves memory (pressed flowers). Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara’s urgency: tactile (crystalline dust), proprioceptive (shifting weight), auditory (subsonic hum). The recurring “gleaming silence” charges the final image, where silence becomes repository. Environment directly enables the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering what was lost—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes memories sediment here. Agency drives escalation: she chooses to descend, pour coffee, exhume. The whale’s death complicates but doesn’t resolve; Mara’s labor retrieves the box. Cost is legible: years of absence condensed into fragile blossoms, now held with irreversible knowledge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: loss as displacement, not annihilation. The wildflowers reprice deletion as preservation, reframing trauma as something retrievable yet altered. No moralizing—insight arises from salt, gravity, and whale song. Final image resonates non-literally: the lantern lighting will never be routine because the world now holds hidden vaults of absence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable, filtered through Mara’s perceptual signature: she notices tidal shifts, lantern routines, mineral textures. Voice modulates with pressure—syntax tightens during excavation (“She worked faster now…”). No head-hopping; diction stays grounded (“tin cup,” “barnacle patterns”). Prose rhythm mirrors gravity fluctuations: long lyrical sentences give way to urgent fragments near climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “frozen lightning,” “vibration in the marrow,” “sedimented here.” Figurative language is coherent (salt as archive, gravity as breath). No loops or scaffold—each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Minor deduction for slight overuse of metaphor in mid-section (“crystalline cathedral”), but closure remains sharp and unblurred.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise transforms familiar tropes (memory loss, whale symbolism) through specific physics (gravity pockets, salt crystallization) and occupation (lantern lighter as witness). The synthesis—deleted memories migrating to geological vaults—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric science-fantasy) heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry. Vision is singular: grief made tangible through coastal geology and cetacean sacrifice.</comment>
