<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her trembling hands, the pressure in her temples, the cautious hope—all rooted in her scientific rigor and moral resolve. Her motivation intensifies credibly as stakes rise, culminating in a high-risk choice that forecloses safety. The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness; emotions emerge through action (e.g., smoothing creased charts post-crisis). However, her flaw remains underexplored beyond competence, limiting full contradiction in crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elena endures cosmic pressure, foreclosing escape to preserve the town, with visible cost (sparks, ozone, trembling). The Causal lens holds—each beat follows because/therefore logic (charts → subsonic plan → transmission overload). The 17-minute clock tightens options, and the final image reconfigures reality without tidy resolution. Cost is legible: fractured trust remains, but unnatural division halts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The university radio station functions as micro-setting: its ancient equipment enables the subsonic hack, and spatial choreography (console, window, cooling fans) remains coherent. Dust motes, coffee cups, and ozone ground the ethereal conflict in tactile reality. The final flickering light charges the ending with symbolic resilience. Only minor deduction: the town’s chaos is described but not spatially integrated beyond the window view.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—halting cosmic-induced discord—is signaled early and escalates via pulsar alignment countdown. Elena’s agency drives escalation: she chooses interference despite risk of mob retaliation. The cost is felt (equipment failure, psychic pressure) and alters tactics (overloading transmitter). However, the tricksters’ threat lacks mid-story adaptation, slightly flattening antagonistic pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: human ingenuity vs. cosmic manipulation, with “ethereal grit” as tonal anchor. The final image—lights steadying after chaos—offers non-literal hope without moralizing. Subtext thrives in action (armbands removed, bricks dropped) rather than exposition. Slight deduction: the “cosmic malice” phrasing edges toward abstraction, though earned by prior particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled, filtered through Elena’s scientific yet vulnerable perception (“celestial signal interpreter’s badge,” “quantum wavelengths”). Voice modulates under pressure: syntax shortens during transmission climax, then expands in reflective aftermath. No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon (no jargon overreach). The perceptual signature—astronomical precision meets human tremor—remains consistent and distinctive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, with strong verbs (“threading insidious frequencies,” “rattling coffee cups”) and varied sentence structure. Figurative language is purposeful (“dust motes danced like galaxies”) and avoided in high-pressure beats. Minor scaffold: “cautiously hopeful” repeats verbatim, creating a slight paraphrase loop. Otherwise, high information density and clean mechanics support momentum without artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cosmic horror and broadcast-tech realism feels fresh and inevitable. The subsonic countermeasure transforms a trope (frequency-based salvation) into grounded mechanics. Risk-taking (quiet climax, no dialogue, abstract antagonists) heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. The “ethereal grit” tone coheres throughout, and the concept commits fully to its implications—no retreat into sentimentality.</comment>
