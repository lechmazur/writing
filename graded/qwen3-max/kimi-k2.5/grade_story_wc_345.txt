<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied, especially in her distrust of silence and her grief-tinged loyalty to Thomas. Her micro-choices—reexamining charts, leading the midnight effort—reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in communal survival over personal skepticism. The ghost’s motivation remains consistent, though his agency is posthumous and spectral, which slightly limits reciprocal pressure. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summarizing mars the characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural drive lens is established early and held through closure: dawn messages accrue into a pattern that culminates in the nebula’s bloom. The Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at dawn—children illuminated by “brambled hope”—carries clear conceptual cost: collective labor replaces individual grief, and Thomas’s final message underscores enduring familial duty beyond death. Orientation is immediate (“Mara woke before the twin suns rose…”) and spatially precise. The causal chain from chalked instructions to atmospheric cultivation is tight, earned, and visually paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The floating rock arches, frost-laced orchards, and alien soil aren’t backdrop—they actively constrain tactics (mirror angles, condensation collection) and charge the final image. The watering bell functions as micro-setting: its ceramic fragility and musical memory tether past to present. Sensory detail is selective and urgent (crunching frost, iridescent chalk, refracted light), filtered through Mara’s agrarian priorities. The environment directly enables the nebula’s formation, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—long-term survival via atmospheric engineering—is signaled early and deepens when Mara reinterprets Thomas’s messages as technical guidance. The meaningful tightening occurs when the council commits to cultivating ionized gas, foreclosing passive waiting. Agency is collective but led by Mara; cost is visible in midnight labor and emotional vulnerability. Luck (Thomas’s ghost) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the solution requires human calibration, not spectral magic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: love as persistent care across states of being, not just biological life. The watering bell’s reuse and the final line—“some hauntings were simply love that refused to abandon its orchard”—offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of trust and kinship. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the “thorns of recent losses” even amid hope. The nebula reweights the premise: respite isn’t found—it’s cultivated through shared breath and memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person limited POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices frost patterns, chalk shimmer, and botanical details. Syntax modulates with pressure—shorter sentences at climax (“She rang it once…”). No head-hopping; even group scenes remain filtered through her observation. The prose rhythm supports accumulation: lyrical in reflection, taut in action. Voice remains consistent without register drift or committee-like neutrality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: “frost patterns and chalk dust,” “brambled hope of survival.” Figurative language is controlled and coherent (no mixed metaphors). Minor scaffold in “strangers no longer but family bound by shared breath” edges toward abstraction but is grounded by immediate context. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with momentum. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The altruistic ghost trope is transformed by grounding it in environmental engineering and communal labor rather than sentiment. The “nebula of respite” is a fresh synthesis of hard sci-fi and lyrical hope. Specificity abounds: Kepler-442b’s twin suns, magnetic anomalies, monarch pollination. The concept commits fully to its premise—haunting as stewardship—and follows implications to a visually and emotionally earned closure. Risk-taking (ghost as engineer) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
