<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is vividly embodied—her perception of sound as memory, her trembling hands, the weight of the satchel—all reveal a character whose sensitivity is both gift and burden. Her motivation (to answer her grandfather’s question) intensifies credibly upon discovering his diaries and the film negative. The final choice—to continue mapping, now as participant rather than observer—is earned through prior causality and carries emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions feel lived-in.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: walls don’t just remember—they dream forward, and Maya now dreams with them. Cost is legible in her trembling hands, the inherited satchel, and the irreversible shift from seeker to collaborator. Orientation is clear by line 3; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, culminating in the ivy-veiled passage “exhaling” as it dreams her return. Every beat tightens the thematic spiral without causal slack.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage, leather-thick leaves, and sodden fireplace aren’t backdrop—they’re active agents that constrain and charge every move. The library’s acoustic memory shapes Maya’s profession and discovery; the ivy becomes part of the building’s “nervous system,” altering how memory transmits. Final image reweights setting: the passage exhales, dreaming her return—environment as sentient archive. Sensory hierarchy aligns perfectly with Maya’s profession and emotional arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—answering what walls dream—is signaled early and deepens when Maya finds proof they dream *forward*. The film negative forces a decisive reconfiguration: she must accept her role in the architecture’s anticipatory memory. Cost is felt in legacy’s burden becoming purpose; agency lies in her choice to keep listening. Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist action under an Accumulative lens, with no coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory isn’t passive recording but collaborative dreaming across time. The final image—Maya leaving as the passage dreams her return—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext thrives in tactile details: brittle pages, melted film, vibrating stone. No overt thesis; wisdom arises from the grandfather’s diaries and Maya’s lived realization, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled first-person limited, filtered through Maya’s acoustic perception (“heard conversations in the way sound bent”). Voice modulates with pressure: lyrical in reflection, taut during discovery. Syntax mirrors her profession—sentences resonate like echoes, varying rhythm to mimic spatial acoustics. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is distinct, consistent, and integral to the story’s conceit.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ivy had changed... roots that cracked stone like paper” establishes altered physics economically. Figurative language serves concept without muddle—e.g., “ghost-pressure of thousands of hands.” Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final line (“already dreaming of her return”) recharges the opening ivy image with new resonance—flawless closure cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms familiar tropes (haunted architecture, legacy quests) into something fresh: buildings as dreaming organisms with organic circuits via climate-adapted ivy. The corridor echo cartographer conceit feels lived-in, not gimmicky. Risk-taking (non-causal, textural escalation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Vision coheres fully—voice, setting, and theme fuse into an original meditation on memory as co-creation across time.</comment>
