<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya’s motivation is deeply rooted in her role as a salvager of drowned truths, and her interiority—embodied through tactile details like the damp diving suit and reverence for small objects—feels specific and lived-in. Katherine’s ghost is rendered with emotional precision, her anguish over her daughter resonating without melodrama. The micro-choice to drive to Halifax crystallizes Maya’s hierarchy of values with tangible cost: emotional labor, physical risk, and solitude. Both characters avoid diagnostic self-awareness; their grief and purpose emerge through action and image, not exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through layered sensory and symbolic density until the final Charged Poise: Maya’s vow to deliver the snow globe reconfigures the entire premise with profound emotional cost. Orientation is immediate (“The shrine glowed amber in the glacier’s heart”) and never falters. The closure—Maya wrapping the globe to surface at dawn—is a Resonant Reconfiguration where love survives drowning, and the cost (decades of silence, a daughter’s lifelong wound) is legible in “the pure, cold knowledge that some things survive even drowning.” Every beat tightens around this revelation without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The glacier shrine functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and charges the narrative: carved ice walls breathe, candles flare in response to emotion, and ancient ship bones embed history into space. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—frost spreading during Katherine’s anguish, the warped glass of the snow globe—never decorative. The lighthouse inside the globe mirrors the real-world stakes, and the setting’s cold clarity sharpens the theme of preserved love. Crucially, the environment shapes the final image: dawn breaking above as Maya prepares to surface ties spatial movement to emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—delivering truth to Evelyn—is signaled early and deepens when Maya names Katherine and reveals Evelyn’s existence, forcing the ghost’s anguish into actionable urgency. The meaningful tightening occurs when Maya shifts from listener to messenger, foreclosing passive witness in favor of costly intervention. Agency is clear: Maya’s method (dream-tracking) led her here, and her choice to drive to Halifax is earned, not coincidental. The cost—bearing another’s grief across decades—is felt in the “familiar ache” and the weight of the ruined globe, charging the final beat without mechanical resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the snow globe’s journey: love persists beyond death not through grand gestures but through fragile, flawed objects carrying last thoughts. The final line—“some things survive even drowning”—offers a non-literal, resonant answer to the central question of whether connection endures loss, reweighting the entire wreck-diving premise. Subtext thrives in silence (Katherine’s outstretched hand passing through the globe) and gesture (Maya wrapping it in cloth), avoiding moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—will Evelyn believe her?—but the emotional truth is undeniable, embracing complexity without false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled in Maya’s first-person-limited perspective, with a distinct perceptual signature: she notices bones in ice, candle flicker, salt-crusted hair—details filtered through her diver’s pragmatism and spiritual sensitivity. Voice modulates under pressure: shorter sentences during Katherine’s anguish (“No. Never. I would have given anything—”) contrast with lyrical cadence in reflection. Dialogue is sparse but potent, Katherine’s voice arriving as “knowing,” not sound, which feels consistent with the ghostly conceit. No head-hopping, no register drift—diction remains grounded in embodied experience throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information yield per line (“candles flickering against walls of ancient ice that held bones of forgotten ships”). Figurative language is precise and coherent—whispers “like strings of pearls,” Katherine’s voice settling “like snow”—without purple excess. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with emotional beats, and paragraph cuts serve tension (e.g., the stark break before “Katherine’s anguish rippled”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; every image advances character, atmosphere, or theme. The final sentence lands with crystalline clarity, free of artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of wreck-diving, dream-tracking, and ice-shrine ritual transforms familiar tropes (ghost stories, salvaged heirlooms) into something singular. The “windows of connection” concept feels fresh because it’s enacted through concrete constraints—carving ice, tracking dreamers—not abstract mysticism. Emotional specificity (a three-year-old’s snow globe, Halifax nursing home) grounds the supernatural in human scale. Risk-taking—ghosts communicating via strangers’ dreams—is fully committed to and pays off in the closure, heightening stakes without gimmickry. The vision feels authentically Maya’s, not templated.</comment>
