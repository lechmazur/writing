<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s ambition and sensory sensitivity drive every choice with concrete, embodied stakes—her journaling, planting ritual, and endurance of the stench all reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her internal contradiction (desire for control vs. need to surrender) operates simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation of ambition-as-mastery is earned through incremental, costly exposure to discomfort. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest through action (“tied cloth across her face,” “whispering encouragement”) rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira’s stance crystallizes in the blooming moment when she opens windows and shares journals, reconfiguring ambition into acceptance with visible cost (enduring revulsion, risking exile). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—wisdom accrues through journal entries, scent intensification, and doodled paper—culminating in a cadence shift from isolation to communal offering. Cost is legible in the line: “I plant what might save us or drive me from my own home.” Orientation anchors cleanly by sentence two; no causality breaks or retroactive patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Veyla’s treetop setting isn’t backdrop but active constraint: canopy bridges limit access, swaying demands physical agility, and open windows are non-negotiable due to olfactory sensitivity. The suspended pot “that would sway with the trees but protect the delicate root system” mirrors Mira’s thematic goal—balance within motion. Final image charges closure: villagers climbing despite stench shows setting enabling transformation. Sensory detail filtered through herbalist POV (detecting “whisper of rot”) avoids tourist cataloging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cultivating serenity within perpetual motion—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s bodily sacrifice (enduring stench that worsens her sensitivity). Agency is clear: she chooses daily exposure, burns incense, ties herbs, yet refuses to abandon the bloom. Escalation is protagonist-driven: each journal entry documents rising cost (“racing thoughts slowed”) until climax where she opens windows, inviting social risk. Coincidence never resolves; the flower’s properties are established upfront, not invented at bloom.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: corpse flower’s stench teaching serenity, grandmother’s doodles framing wisdom as inherited practice, journal as vessel of undercurrent. Final line—“ambition and acceptance could bloom from the same mysterious seed”—offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture: saving wrapping paper, whispering to seed, framing doodles. Avoids tidy binaries; serenity isn’t stillness but “grace” within decay’s discomfort.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Mira notices botanical shifts others miss (“subtlest shift in a plant’s chemistry”), filters world through scent and touch. Prose rhythm modulates with pressure—longer sentences during planting ritual, clipped phrases during stench endurance (“Still, the smell crept through”). Free indirect style cleanly blends narration and thought (“She had searched three years…”). No head-hopping; single POV remains anchored in treetop workshop throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High information density: “brown paper covered with her grandmother's doodled vines and smiling suns” establishes custom, character, and motif in one phrase. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is precise (“wildflower hush,” “tide of thought”) without purple excess. Final line’s cadence (“mysterious seed”) echoes opening’s “dark oval,” creating resonant propulsion without monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms “healing herb” trope through specific constraints: olfactory sensitivity makes corpse flower both threat and cure, treetop village necessitates balance-over-stillness, journaling replaces magical intuition with disciplined observation. Fresh inflection: stench as teacher, not obstacle. Synthesis feels inevitable—grandmother’s doodles, journal, seed, and Veyla’s sway cohere into a singular vision. Risks lyric density without sacrificing clarity; no safety hedging in moral calculus (peace requires enduring decay).</comment>
