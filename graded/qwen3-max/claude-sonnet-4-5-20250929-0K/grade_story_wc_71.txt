<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s hyperawareness is embodied through precise micro-choices—collecting objects, arranging altars—and her internal contradiction (obsession as both burden and gift) culminates in a renunciation that feels earned. Her epiphany avoids therapy-speak by grounding insight in tactile ritual (“sanctifying them through noticing”). The final choice to continue her work carries visible cost: solitude, marginalization, yet purpose. No diagnostic labels; emotion flows through action and perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the house exhales, windows clear, and Mara departs with renewed mission—all legible as a before/after shift under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is felt in the quiet burden of witness, crystallized in the “hushed blaze” realization. The orris root shard catalyzes transformation without contrivance, and causality holds via patterned accumulation of displaced objects. Orientation anchors are immediate and sustained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The bay, tideline, and Kettering house function as active micro-settings that constrain and charge choices—the tideline supplies Mara’s ritual objects, the empty house demands her attention. Sensory detail (violets-and-earth scent, streetlights’ “dreaming state”) filters through Mara’s perceptual bias. The final image—windows “holding light like a promise”—is charged by setting-as-character. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography is precise and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—houses needing witness—is signaled early and deepens when the Kettering house responds to Mara’s offerings. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: each object placement tightens the thematic pressure until the house “exhales,” foreclosing Mara’s prior isolation with the cost of lifelong responsibility. Coincidence (dumped orris root) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her method. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: displacement seeks return, observation sanctifies. The ending reweights all prior collecting as sacred witness, not pathology—answering the central question (“why some houses feel alive”) without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture (pocketing the root, touching the doorframe) and image (streetlights waking as Mara leaves). Ambiguity lingers—Is the house truly alive?—but emotional truth is undeniable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinctively lyrical yet grounded, with rhythmic control that modulates from dusk’s liminality to the “hushed blaze” climax. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mara notices creeping change others miss, and syntax mirrors her attentiveness (long, flowing sentences for observation; short clauses for revelation). No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained. Prose as character: diction (“inadvertently profound,” “shard of hush”) reflects her poetic sensibility without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is precise (“streetlights blinked awake,” “hollow as drums”) and coheres without muddle. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in “creeping normality” phrasing (slightly clinical), but no loops, scaffold, or artifacts dull the closure. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the story’s pulse.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms the “haunted house” trope into a meditation on attention as animating force. Originality lies in the synthesis: displaced objects as archaeological relics of feeling, houses as sentient through witness. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure, conceptual stakes) heightens meaning without gimmickry. Specificity (orriss root, Victorian homes, pharmacy greeting cards) roots universals in lived detail. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
