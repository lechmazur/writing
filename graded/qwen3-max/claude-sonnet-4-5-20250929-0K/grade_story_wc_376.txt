<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s embodied sensitivity to dishonesty drives every choice with visceral specificity—her wilting isn’t metaphor but physiological constraint. Her motivation crystallizes through micro-choices (piecing the map, descending tunnels) that align with her calligrapher’s patience and moral intolerance for evasion. The grandmother reveal deepens interiority without exposition, and Mira’s final commitment feels earned by accumulated pressure. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion stays anchored in action and sensation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira accepts delivery of unspoken truths, reconfiguring her role from preserver to conduit. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via map fragments, annotations, and archive vessels until the final decision reweights all prior silence. Cost is legible in the toxic sky above versus the honest depth below; the grandmother’s legacy imposes a lived burden, not abstract duty. Orientation is immediate and sustained, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse city’s toxic sky and synthesized water aren’t backdrop—they actively shape stakes (rationing euphemisms, exhaustion of springs). The zinc fragment and gilded leaves function as micro-settings that constrain choice: only a calligrapher would recognize the handwriting, only someone attuned to permanence would pursue lost words. Final image charges the setting: truth settles *beneath* the domes, making geography thematic. Sensory detail is selective, urgent, and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding where candor goes—is signaled early and tightens via Mira’s physical revulsion to lies. Her descent escalates pressure coherently: each level down strengthens her body as she moves away from systemic dishonesty. The archive confrontation forces a crystallized stance: preserve or deliver? She chooses the latter, accepting ongoing labor with visible cost (carrying unsent truths into a lying world). Agency drives every turn; coincidence never resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: pressed flowers with unwritten confessions, annotations like “Father’s confession, unsent.” Subtext thrives in what’s withheld above versus preserved below. The ending offers a non-literal answer—truth must be carried, not just stored—repricing Veridium’s culture of evasion. No moralizing; resonance arises from Mira’s quiet “Show me how it works,” which reweights every prior silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled, first-person limited with a calligrapher’s perceptual signature—she notices ink, leaf grain, handwriting. Voice modulates with pressure: lyrical during puzzle-work, stark in confrontation (“But they’re still unspoken”). Syntax varies purposefully; candlelight sentences breathe, archive dialogue cuts sharp. No head-hopping, no register drift—diction stays within Mira’s tactile, precise lexicon throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “skies the color of spoiled milk,” “words we swallow don’t disappear, they settle.” Every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot—no scaffolding. Figurative language is coherent (decay, preservation, weight) and peaks cleanly at closure. Zero loops or synonym churn; rhythm shifts with emotional cadence. Final line lands with earned simplicity after textured buildup.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise transforms trope (hidden archive) via specific logic: candor as physical residue, mapped by emotional landmarks. The “Listening Archive” feels inevitable in hindsight—rooted in Mira’s trait, profession, and city’s decay. Bold risk: making honesty a somatic condition in a world of euphemism. Vision coheres across voice, setting, and stakes without gimmickry; originality serves emotional truth, not novelty.</comment>
