<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marta’s blithe exterior and internal rigor cohere flawlessly; her micro-choices—aligning letter with tapestry, counting symbols—reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in legacy and truth. Her emotional progression from defeat to resolve avoids tidy resolution, embodying contradiction (humming gardener vs. obsessive decoder). The final decision to visit the graves is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of inherited burden. No diagnostic label-speak or unearned epiphanies mar her interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Marta’s realization reconfigures options (“the game was just beginning”) with conceptual cost—the weight of correcting historical erasure. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, escalating via density (tapestry, letter, coins converging) and cadence shift into understanding. Orientation is immediate and functional disorientation (frayed text) pays off at closure. Cost is legible in “tenderly organized archive of truth” and the sovereign case’s unresolved weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt silo functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (private decoding space) and charges the final image (“silo stood sentinel under the infinite dark”). Sensory detail is selective—velveteen gloom, peeling spirals—and filtered through Marta’s professional and familial gaze. The cemetery’s iron gates and sovereign case anchor locale without exposition. Every object serves pressure or closure, avoiding white-room syndrome or decorative description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering obscured identities—is signaled early and deepens when Marta shifts from decoding symbols to grasping intention. The tightening occurs in her epiphany about “shape of intentions,” which narrows her method and raises emotional stakes. Agency drives escalation: her alignment of letter and tapestry yields coordinates. Cost is felt in the burden of inherited truth, though slightly abstracted rather than viscerally dramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the tension between official record and lived truth, mirrored in chess strategy and frayed ink. The ending offers a non-literal answer—truth requires decoding intention, not just symbols—repricing memory as active stewardship. No moralizing; resonance arises through sovereign case, tapestry, and uncharted echoes. Complexity is preserved: Marta inherits both duty and mystery, not resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinctively perceptual—Marta notices patterns, deterioration, spatial relationships—with rhythmic control that tightens during discovery (“She traced… counting… measuring”). Prose modulates under pressure: longer sentences for reflection, clipped phrases for action. POV remains stable and modest; no head-hopping or omniscience. Elision (grandmother’s motives) is purposeful and paid off through Marta’s earned inference, not retroactive explanation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “frayed threads of ink, words bleeding” does double duty in image and theme. Minor overwriting in “velveteen, soft and smothering at once” slightly dilutes momentum, but figurative language remains coherent. No loops, scaffold, or syntactic monotony; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Final line recharges “blithe” with new valence, fulfilling opening-anchor promise without artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess, cemetery work, and textile code feels inevitable in hindsight. The “uncharted echoes” concept transforms archival labor into emotional archaeology. Risk-taking (textile cryptography, sovereign case as key) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Voice, setting, and theme cohere into singular vision—no template tropes or derivative safety. Specificity (cobalt silo, marigolds, sovereign case) grounds universals in irreplaceable detail.</comment>
