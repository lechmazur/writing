<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is deeply rooted in witnessed civilizational collapse, and her ghostly agency manifests through precise, escalating micro-choices (e.g., tailoring chalk messages to observed needs). Her internal contradiction—powerless yet purposeful—is embodied in the tactile struggle with chalk and ectoplasm. The final renunciation of solitude (“not doing it alone”) feels earned by her nightly labor and the colonists’ reciprocal action. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are channeled through concrete acts like admiring recovering orchards.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story operates under a Causal lens: because Mara leaves messages, therefore trust rebuilds, culminating in Joren’s public reexamination. Orientation is immediate (“ghost of Mara Vestrel… dead for three hundred years… drifted through the orchard planet”). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kessa ringing the bell crystallizes communal renewal, with cost legible in the “poisoned soil” and fractured past. Every beat tightens toward this earned shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard planet’s floating arches, silver-leaved trees, and twilight atmosphere aren’t backdrop—they actively shape stakes (blight destroys livelihood) and tactics (Mara uses arch shadows for concealment, paths for messaging). The butterfly garden bell and chalked sidewalks function as micro-settings that constrain choice. Final image of the nebula “where new stars were born” charges closure by reframing “respite” as collective creation, not passive refuge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—communal survival versus fragmentation—is signaled early and escalates causally through Mara’s orchestrated exchanges. The tightening occurs when colonists move from suspicion (“Could be a trap”) to tangible cooperation (metal scraps traded, meetings arranged). Cost is visible: poisoned soil, eroded trust, wasted time. Mara’s agency drives every escalation; coincidence never resolves conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from action: interdependence as antidote to collapse. Avoids moralizing; instead, the chalk messages and shared labor dramatize connection as necessity. Final line—“respite isn’t a place… it’s what we build together”—reweights the premise without stating a moral, offering Conceptual Repricing. The nebula image deepens this by linking human effort to cosmic renewal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains tightly focalized through Mara, with perceptual specificity (“translucent form weaving,” “chalk felt strange in her ectoplasmic fingers”). Voice modulates rhythmically: lyrical in description, urgent in action. Dialogue is sparse but distinct (Joren’s elder gravitas vs. Kessa’s fearless curiosity). No head-hopping; even group scenes filter through Mara’s ghostly observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “brambled hope,” “roots pushing through poisoned soil,” “serpentine shadows” all do double duty. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is consistent (horticultural/cosmic motifs) and peaks cleanly at closure. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally, with paragraph cuts that heighten momentum (e.g., short punch after “There was still so much work to do.”)</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms the “benevolent ghost” trope through sci-fi specificity: an orchard planet with floating geology, refugees from dying worlds, chalk as medium for rebuilding society. The fusion of ecological collapse, diaspora trauma, and spectral intervention feels fresh yet inevitable. Risk-taking (ghost as community organizer via sidewalk chalk) heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Vision coheres across setting, method, and closure.</comment>
