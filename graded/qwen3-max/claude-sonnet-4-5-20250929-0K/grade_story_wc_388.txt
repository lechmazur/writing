<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera’s motivation—excavating truth from comforting lies—is dramatized through her methodical reassembly of shredded documents and her final decision to protect the diamond’s location. Her internal contradiction (debunker who preserves mystery) manifests in embodied choices, not exposition. The renunciation of full disclosure is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost: she accepts that some truths must be guarded, not broadcast. No diagnostic label-speak or tidy resolution mars her emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Vera chooses to rebury the diamond and obscure its coordinates, foreclosing the path of total transparency at a visible conceptual cost. The Causal lens holds tightly—each beat follows because/therefore logic from document discovery to dig to decision. Orientation is immediate (“Vera stood among gnarled apple trees… radioactive dust”), and cost is legible in the final lines: “Some truths needed excavating. Others needed guardians.” No coincidences resolve pressure; all turns stem from Vera’s agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard isn’t backdrop—it’s active micro-setting: luminous apples against gray sky, poisoned snow on shoulders, roots reaching toward the stillpoint. These details constrain choice (digging where soil is loose) and charge the final image (trees thriving while Vera walks away). Sensory hierarchy reflects Vera’s focus: brittle paper fragments, Geiger clicks, absence of nausea near the diamond. The recurring diamond object reweights meaning at closure, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus myth—is signaled early and tightens when Vera uncovers Project Stillpoint, forcing a trade-off: expose the science or preserve the miracle. Escalation is driven by her agency (reassembling, triangulating, digging), not coincidence. Cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices her debunker identity’s purity to protect hope. The deepening—from curse to accident to guarded truth—narrows options until only one ethical path remains.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: truth’s utility versus its burden. The final image—Vera leaving lies behind but carrying “an uncomfortable truth that might let others keep hoping”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Recurring motifs (shredded paper, luminous fruit, poisoned snow) accrue meaning without overt symbolism. Ambiguity lingers: is guarding truth paternalistic or compassionate? No prompt-like thesis statement intrudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinctively Vera’s: precise, skeptical, yet quietly reverent. Syntax modulates under pressure—short, clipped sentences during digging; lyrical cadence in reflection (“poisoned snow,” “earth remembered what life tasted like”). Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices brittle paper edges, lead-lined foam, cloudy inclusions. No head-hopping; focalization stays tight within her knowledge bounds. Prose rhythm supports thematic tension between clarity and mystery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: “radioactive dust settled on her shoulders like poisoned snow” merges setting, tone, and character in one image. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is restrained and coherent (no mixed metaphors). Final line (“she’d leave the miracle intact”) recharges the orchard motif with earned resonance. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally, avoiding syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes through scientific specificity: flawed diamond lattice creating a radiation stillpoint feels fresh and plausible. Emotional truth grounds the ingenuity—Vera’s choice mirrors real-world dilemmas about knowledge stewardship. The synthesis of conspiracy culture, hard science, and ecological hope feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (quiet ending, no villain, intellectual protagonist) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
