<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcel’s motivation—rooted in professional identity and empathetic duty—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies credibly. His internal contradiction (weary resignation vs. compelled action) operates simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation (“The dead have hired me”) is earned by prior causality with visible cost: closing his parlor, risking his life. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are conveyed through concrete action and perception under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Marcel enables the ghosts to release their vigil by restoring their sanctuary, foreclosing his own return to ordinary practice with palpable cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds via dream imagery, object resonance, and atmospheric density, culminating in a cadence shift at installation of the lens. Cost is legible in the final image: “blessedly empty” dreams imply permanent psychic toll. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The underwater library functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its impossible geometry dictates Marcel’s descent, breathing, and repair work. The broken lens—a recurring object—charges the final image when reinstalled, multiplying bioluminescence into “a cathedral of refracted illumination.” Sensory detail is selective, POV-filtered (undertaker’s tactile precision), and evolves causally with action. Environment directly enables the resolution, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—giving rest a permanent address—is signaled early and deepens via Marcel’s realization that burial is impossible; only restoration works. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he chooses to descend, repair, and install the lens. Cost is unmistakable: exhaustion, abandonment of livelihood, and irreversible psychic exposure. Pressure tightens once meaningfully, narrowing options from burial to revitalization, consistent with the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: devotion mistaken for stubbornness gains dignity through witness. The final image—ghosts fading as the lens refracts light—offers a non-literal answer to whether vigilance can be honored without perpetuation. No moralizing; resonance arises from particulars (coral-crusted bookshelves, phosphorescent SOS). Subtext operates in silence and gesture; the story resists tidy binaries, embracing ambiguity about duty beyond death.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Marcel notices decay, order, and thresholds like a professional caretaker (“gentle hands,” “packing embalming tools”). Rhythmic control modulates with pressure—longer sentences in dreams, clipped efficiency during repair. No head-hopping; single POV remains stable. Elision (e.g., time distortion underwater) is taught early and pays off in closure’s “blessedly empty” stillness. Voice remains consistent even in lyric passages.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Syntax varies purposefully; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching descent/ascent. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is precise (“constellation of sharp-edged fragments,” “chasing the strange stillness”) without muddle. Final line resonates by recharging “stillness” from burden to peace. Minor deduction for one slightly ornate phrase (“architectural impossibility”), but clarity at closure remains pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: an undertaker as psychopomp for drowned scholars reframes both professions as acts of witnessing. Tropes (lighthouse, underwater city) are transformed through specific logic—the library’s refusal to acknowledge physics mirrors the scholars’ devotion. Bold risk: prioritizing quiet restoration over rescue, which heightens thematic stakes. Conceptual integrity is total; every element serves the core idea. The ending feels inevitable yet surprising, with high irreplaceability.</comment>
