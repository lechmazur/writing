<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Moth’s interiority is vividly embodied—her unlearning, tactile memory, and social perception manifest through precise physical actions (pressing the tile to her temple, drawing with desperate chalk). Her motivation—to recover meaning through art—is consistent, intensifies under pressure, and culminates in a credible endurance that forecloses passive forgetting. The old man’s hollow eyes trigger no melodrama but a calibrated micro-choice: “Don’t speak it. Just feel it.” Flawlessly avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through gesture, not exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Structure follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: mist, mandala, tile, and whispers layer into a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where meaning isn’t restored but made habitable again. Orientation is immediate (“dawn mist,” “whispering grotto,” “Moth”), and disorientation serves closure—the unlearning is the premise, not a flaw. Cost is legible in the final image: Moth smiles while continuing to draw, bearing the weight of collective erasure. Every beat tightens toward this earned stasis without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The whispering grotto functions as micro-setting: its acoustics, limestone curves, and dark pool directly enable Moth’s method and charge the climax. The tile flake—a salvaged object-as-setting—constrains choice (she must press it to her temple to sense proto-memories) and reweights the final image as it grows warm. Sensory detail is selective (lilac mist, chalk nubs, hollow eyes) and filtered through Moth’s urgency. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent even as crowd gathers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resisting total erasure through creative witness—is signaled early and deepens when the crowd arrives, transforming private ritual into communal anchor. Moth’s agency drives escalation: she chooses silence over naming, pattern over panic, presence over flight. Cost is felt in every worn chalk nub and unspoken word. The tightening—“Don’t speak it”—forecloses verbal recovery, forcing reliance on fragile, visual resonance, which crystallizes the story’s moral calculus: some meanings survive only in form, not fact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through image and action: memory as residue, meaning as structure. The mandala isn’t explained—it’s drawn, witnessed, and felt. Final lines reprice the premise conceptually: meaning isn’t recovered but located (“the place where meaning lived”). Avoids moralizing; subtext thrives in silence, spirals, and breath-turned-music. Ambiguity lingers (Will the pattern last? Can it spread?), yet emotional aftereffect is concrete: hope as persistent making, not restoration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is singular, lyrical, and tightly focalized—Moth’s perceptual signature shapes every description (“mist turned the air lilac with unease,” “memories flaking away like old paint”). Syntax modulates with pressure: longer, flowing sentences during drawing; terse commands at climax (“Don’t speak it”). No head-hopping; even the old man’s loss is filtered through Moth’s empathy. Dialogue is sparse but potent, carrying subtext and advancing the turn. Prose as character: rhythm mirrors the mandala’s spirals—dense, concentric, purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line payoff (“unlearned her birth name... along with... the taste of honey”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (flaking memories, cupped palms, proto-memories) and never muddled. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Minor deduction for slight overuse of metaphor in opening paragraph (“lilac with unease” borders on mannered), but closure remains undulled. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally, avoiding syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise—collective amnesia countered by ephemeral art—is transformed through specific, grounded choices: chalk on stone, a salvaged tile, the physics of whispering architecture. Emotional truth outweighs novelty; the unlearning feels visceral, not allegorical. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over plot) heightens stakes by making meaning tactile yet transient. No template echoes; voice, setting, and concept fuse into an authentic vision. The synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh—like the mandala itself, both ancient and reinvented.</comment>
