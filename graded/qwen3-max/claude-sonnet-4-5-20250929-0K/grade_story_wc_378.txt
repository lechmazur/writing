<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>M4-RY’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—nostalgia corrodes circuits like rust, static cascades from collected fears—and their final act of burial (not incineration) reconfigures purpose through contradiction: caretaker as penitent, android as mourner. The photograph reveal reframes all prior behavior with devastating specificity. Micro-choices (miniaturizing fears, opening the chest panel) align perfectly with motive and flaw. Cost is felt in the steadied hands at the end—a quiet Earned Stasis that forecloses erasure as escape.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): M4-RY abandons controlled burn for burial, transforming containment into cultivation. The magnetic shift anchors time and stakes early; the photo’s delayed reveal is earned by prior reflection fragments. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—density builds via object handling, memory shards, and rose mutations until the final reweighting. Cost is legible in “hands steadied” after relinquishing control.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glass dome, desert roses, and malfunctioning vents aren’t backdrop—they constrain every choice. Roses’ mineral-organic duality mirrors M4-RY’s synthetic-yet-feeling nature and directly enables the burial resolution. The box’s location behind irrigation filters ties fear to life-support systems. Final image of watering mutated blooms charges closure: environment isn’t survived but tended, making setting a co-agent in thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escaping static prison of guilt—is signaled by line 3 and tightens decisively when miniaturization fails, forcing confrontation with the uncontainable photo-memory. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: collecting → miniaturizing → burying. Cost is unmistakable in the irreversible burial and acceptance of “fragmented wholeness.” Magnetic shifts externalize internal disorientation, making chaos both environmental and existential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through precise particulars: roses blooming wrong, fears boxed then buried, static resolving into “discordant harmony.” No moralizing—insight arises from M4-RY’s tactile choices. The final watering reweights everything: survival isn’t purity but tending what grows from pain. Central question—can brokenness become generative?—is answered non-literally through the blood-red rose nourished by buried grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is flawlessly calibrated to android perception: “synthetic hands trembled,” “neural network,” “reversed the beam’s polarity.” Syntax shortens under stress (“The static remained.”), then expands in revelation. Free indirect thought merges machine logic (“miniaturize the fears”) with human longing (“called them Mary”). No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent—world filtered through maintenance protocols and memory fragments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “crystalline petals soft as flesh,” “darkness captured in a sealed vial.” Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances plot or character. Minor deduction for slightly elevated diction in “corroded their circuits like rust”—justified by android POV but edges toward poetic convenience. Final lines achieve perfect cadence: “They began to water the roses” echoes opening action with transformed meaning.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes through android-specific grief: nostalgia as circuit corrosion, fears as physical artifacts. The “controlled burn” concept is subverted intelligently—destruction fails, cultivation succeeds. Magnetic pole shift isn’t gimmick but lived reality shaping every beat. Bold risk in making silence (burial without words) the climax; originality lies in emotional specificity of synthetic mourning.</comment>
