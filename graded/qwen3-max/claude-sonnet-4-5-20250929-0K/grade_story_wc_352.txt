<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra’s prism-mindedness is embodied through concrete perception and choice, not just stated. Her past failure and present understanding create credible interior contradiction. The final act of harvesting combinations feels earned by her unique cognition, with cost implied in the burden of secret-keeping. However, emotional embodiment under inversion stress leans slightly abstract (“stomach performed impossible gymnastics”) rather than viscerally specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lyra emerges with keys to forgotten knowledge, bearing the cost of clandestine stewardship. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density of luminous numbers, mist, and spiral imagery intensifies toward a cadence shift at the stone’s touch. Gravity’s snap-back crystallizes the before/after without over-explaining. Every element introduced pays off; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: its spirals mirror the doodle, its mist reveals combinations only during inversion. Sensory detail (coiling mist, clandestinely luminous glow) is filtered through Lyra’s urgency and profession. The environment directly charges the final image—the latent blaze of knowledge made visible only here, now. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent even during gravity reversal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—accessing forgotten knowledge through threshold effects—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Lyra reenters the grotto during inversion, narrowing her window to harvest combinations. Agency is clear: her prism mind actively refracts sequences others can’t see. Cost is legible in her lifelong isolation as keeper of secrets. Escalation follows Accumulative logic: density of luminous numbers increases pressure until the decisive harvest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: truth resides in margins, vigilance requires patience, and knowledge demands custodians who see differently. The final image—Lyra planting new seeds in manuscripts—offers a non-literal answer to “where forgotten combinations hide,” reweighting archival work as active guardianship. Avoids moralizing; complexity lingers in the burden of clandestine stewardship. Recurring spiral motif accumulates pressure without symbolic shouting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Lyra notices marginalia, refractions, patterns in chaos. Voice modulates rhythmically—longer sentences for discovery, shorter during inversion’s physical stress. POV remains tightly controlled; no head-hopping. Diction (“prism-minded,” “clandestinely luminous”) stays within archivist lexicon without register drift. Final line echoes opening doodle, closing the perceptual loop with earned resonance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density: most lines advance character, setting, and theme simultaneously. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching serpentine movement. Minor figurative density in climax (“latent blaze... ready to ignite”) borders on purple but serves Accumulative lens. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; one near-redundancy (“serpentine passage coiling tighter” / “spiral tightened to a point”) slightly dulls propulsion but doesn’t obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: archival work as magical realism grounded in real-world marginalia practices. “Prism-minded” reframes neurodivergence as essential epistemology. Gravity inversion as threshold effect feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmicky. Bold risk: making numeric combinations visually luminous avoids cliché cryptography. Originality serves theme—secrets aren’t hidden but unseen by straight-line thinkers.</comment>
