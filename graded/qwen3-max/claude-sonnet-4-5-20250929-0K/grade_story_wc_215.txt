<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her astonishment, perceptiveness, and moral clarity arise from concrete observation, not abstraction. Her decisive act of reading the letter stems directly from her understanding of the ghosts’ entrapment in silence, making her choice feel inevitable yet costly. The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness; her emotions emerge through tactile interaction with dust, hives, and glass. Her renunciation of beekeeping for truth-keeping crystallizes a credible, earned endurance with thematic weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds tightly: sensory density (bleached frames, crumbling cloth, crystalline wings) builds toward the climactic release of words. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—ghosts dissipate not through sound but witnessed speech—making cost legible in their thinning forms. The stained glass box functions as both artifact and catalyst, its discovery and opening forming a causal arc within an otherwise lyric structure. Orientation is immediate and sustained, with no disorientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned oasis isn’t backdrop but active constraint: bleached hives, hidden spring, and eucalyptus tree shape every key action. The setting charges the final image—the box placed on roots where ghosts gather—transforming geography into ritual space. Sensory details (scorching winds, captured honey light) are filtered through Mara’s perception, avoiding tourist cataloging. The micro-setting of the hive and box constrains choice and reweights meaning at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—breaking the covenant of silence—is signaled early and deepens when Mara chooses to open the box despite knowing the taboo. This tightening forecloses the path of passive witnessing, forcing active intervention with visible cost: she assumes the burden of keeper-of-words. Agency is clear, pressure coherent, and escalation driven by her perception (“She would not let this box add another ghost”). Coincidence never resolves; the ghosts’ arrival is drawn by pattern, not plot convenience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from object, action, and silence: unspoken words become haunting burdens. The ending offers a non-literal answer—truth need only be witnessed, not heard—to the central question of whether harmony requires suppression. No moralizing; resonance arises from the ghosts’ dissipation and Mara’s quiet vow. The stained glass bees reframe beekeeping as metaphor for fragile, necessary truths.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinctively Mara’s: lyrical but precise, with a perceptual signature that notices “dust patterns” and “shadow angles.” Syntax modulates under pressure—longer descriptive sentences early, tighter phrasing at climax (“Mara opened it”). No head-hopping; single POV remains stable. The prose avoids therapy-speak, and the final paragraph’s cadence echoes earlier motifs without redundancy, achieving Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: “crystalline blue” wings, “captured honey” light, “soundless arguments” all advance atmosphere and theme. Minor overwriting in “translucent forms” and “trembling emotion” slightly dilutes peak beats, but no loops or scaffold. Sentence variety supports rhythm, and the final line (“mercifully, released”) lands with earned weight. One near-redundancy (“soundlessly… silent testimony”) costs 0.1, but propulsion remains strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ghost-as-unspoken-words conceit feels fresh through specific grounding in beekeeping culture and stained glass craftsmanship. Tropes of drought, hauntings, and oases are transformed by the covenant of silence and Mara’s role as witness-archivist. The synthesis of ecology, grief, and speech feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric structure, passive protagonist who acts decisively once) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
