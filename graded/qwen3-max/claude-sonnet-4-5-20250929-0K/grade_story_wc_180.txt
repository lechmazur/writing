<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Marta’s interiority is richly embodied—her shame, regret, and yearning pulse through tactile details (the ribbon, the bag, the grinding stone). Her flawed compromise with the corporation feels tragically human, not schematic. Lena’s feistiness manifests in dialogue and action (“You promised me the old methods”), not just labels. Their reconciliation emerges from shared craft, not sentimentality, with visible cost: lost time, trust, workshop.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The causal chain is airtight: broken vow → corporate betrayal → estrangement → cryptic summons → rediscovery of craft. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): hands grinding quartz together reconfigure their relationship under the cathedral’s reconsecrated canopy. Cost is legible in Marta’s lost reputation and Lena’s fragmented memory. The “deciduous vows” concept crystallizes meaning without moralizing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard setting isn’t backdrop—it’s active crucible. Apple trees cracking marble embody adaptation; rafters become work platforms. Tools (grinding stone, bag) and objects (ribbon, quartz) constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail (blossoms drifting, clinking stones) filters through Marta’s grief and hope, never generic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving generational wisdom—is signaled early and tightens when Lena reveals her incomplete knowledge. Marta’s agency drives escalation: climbing, unpacking the bag, demonstrating the grind. Cost is felt in every beat: lost workshop, strained silence, the physical act of relearning. The cathedral’s persistence mirrors their struggle—coherent pressure under a Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: tradition vs. progress, mercy vs. precision, vows that shed forms but keep roots. The ribbon and grinding stone accrue meaning without symbolism shouting. Final image—blossoms on joined hands grinding quartz—offers non-literal answer: wisdom persists through practice, not contracts. No moralizing; complexity lingers in Lena’s softened anger and Marta’s earned humility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Marta’s sensory and emotional world. Voice modulates with intensity: lyrical in description (“apple blossoms drifted”), taut in conflict (“You promised me”). Dialogue distinguishes characters—Lena’s bluntness vs. Marta’s regretful cadence. Syntax varies purposefully; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is precise (“quartz-eye mender,” “prayers became fruit”) without purple excess. Rhythm breathes with scene needs—short clauses during climb, flowing syntax in reconciliation. Zero loops or scaffold; closure image (“blossoms fell through slanted light”) lands with quiet propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise transforms familiar tropes (craft vs. industry, mother-daughter rift) through specific, grounded details: quartz lens grinding, cathedral orchard, deciduous vows. Emotional truth anchors ingenuity—Marta’s corporate compromise feels painfully plausible. Final reconfiguration (hands grinding together) feels inevitable yet fresh. Bold risk: making craft mechanics central to emotional resolution.</comment>
