<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tremors, warmth of the chain, and grandfather’s moral calculus ground her choices in lived contradiction. Her motivation intensifies organically from forensic curiosity to ethical engineering, with micro-choices (leaving the letter unsealed, sketching under pressure) revealing a hierarchy that values both people and history. The final redesign emerges credibly from her dual identity as machinist and inheritor of wisdom. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion remains tactile and conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira’s unsealed letter crystallizes options without resolving them, making cooperation legible yet uncertain. The cost—political risk, potential failure—is felt in her “dappled resolve” and the mountain’s waiting breath. Causal lens holds: adhesive analysis → understanding tampering → redesign → unsealed delivery. Every beat tightens toward this poised act, with no extraneous moves or retroactive patches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The amphitheater and volcano aren’t backdrop but active constraints: basalt ribs channel geothermal pressure, mineral deposits block secondary channels, and stone groans guide measurement. The surveyor’s chain functions as micro-setting—its brass links warm, gleaming, coiled like a serpent—directly enabling the solution. Sensory detail (humid air, porous rock, dappled dusk) filters through Mira’s professional attention. Final image charges the stones as co-conspirators in harmony.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—village safety vs. irreplaceable frescoes—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes collaboration is the only path. Her agency drives escalation: analyzing glue, measuring channels, drafting a staged floodgate system. The cost is unmistakable—she risks rejection by both factions—and the tightening forecloses unilateral action. Moral calculus sharpens the climax: not choosing between goods but engineering their coexistence under shared labor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: encrypted compassion decoded into collaborative engineering, fresco gestures echoing communal purpose, the chain embodying precision and mercy. The ending offers a non-literal answer—harmony isn’t consensus but honest attempt—and reweights “measurement” as moral calibration. No moralizing; resonance arises from volcanic breath syncing with human resolve. Ambiguity lingers (will they cooperate?), but the cost of trying is clear.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Mira’s machinist-perception: she notices pH, fibers, mineral deposits, pressure gradients. Voice modulates rhythm—longer sentences for reflection, clipped phrases during sketching—to mirror cognitive load. Distinct perceptual signature: machinery as moral architecture, stones as breathing entities. No head-hopping; prose syntax embodies her blend of technical rigor and ancestral wisdom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “brass serpent,” “encrypted compassion,” “dappled resolve” do triple duty. Figurative language is coherent (breathing stones, exhaling volcano) and pattern-taught early. Minor overwriting in “trembled through her like voltage” slightly strains metaphor, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s cadence—“whatever trembling future her measurements had set in motion”—perfectly echoes opening descent while deepening stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise transforms trope (engineer saves heritage) via specific synthesis: floodgates as ethical dilemma, adhesive analysis as forensic empathy, collaboration as engineered necessity. Emotional truth outweighs novelty—the frescoes’ untranslated language speaks through gesture, mirroring Mira’s own wordless offering. Risk-taking (unsealed letter, staged valves) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular: mechanics as moral philosophy, measurement as mercy.</comment>
