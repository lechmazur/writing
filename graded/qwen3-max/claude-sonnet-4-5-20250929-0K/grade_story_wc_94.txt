<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her contradictions (silenced yet screaming, wounded yet healing) manifest in micro-choices like winding the timer and sealing poems. Her motivation crystallizes organically from trauma into purpose (“cartography of scars”), avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. The final act—folding the poem, planning its clandestine delivery—shows credible endurance with visible cost: exile, erasure, perpetual vigilance. No stock phrasing; every emotion ties to concrete sensation (forehead on glass, storm-dictated rhythm).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara’s refusal to stop documenting, despite censorship, forecloses safety but affirms witness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure tightens via storm imagery and timer intervals, culminating in “becoming the archive they couldn’t erase.” Cost is legible in her isolation and the city’s “broken promise” lights. Orientation anchors instantly (“observatory above the cloudline”), and the 3-month timeframe sharpens stakes without disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The observatory isn’t backdrop—it constrains choice (altitude = clarity, thin air = rarefied truth) and charges closure: lightning illuminates her page, clouds part to reveal the city’s “stubborn” lights. The darkroom timer functions as micro-setting, its ticks measuring resistance. Sensory detail (copper dome catching lightning, cold glass) is selective, urgent, and filtered through Mara’s poetic perception. Weather actively shapes rhythm and revelation, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth-telling under repression—is signaled early and deepens via Mara’s shift from personal grief to collective cartography. Agency drives escalation: she chooses vigil structure, rarefies language, and risks contraband distribution. Cost is unmistakable: UNRELIABLE branding, exile, the weight of unspeakable loss. The storm’s “furiously tranquil” paradox mirrors her internal pressure, narrowing options to disciplined resistance or surrender—she endures, foreclosing silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: censored words as landmarks, disappeared people as canyons. The final image—Mara mapping wounds “above the clouds”—reweights silence as testimony without moralizing. Subtext thrives in objects (timer, envelope) and actions (writing in lightning flashes). Ambiguity lingers (“not hope exactly, but its cousin”) while rejecting false equivalence—the regime’s brutality is unambiguous, resistance necessary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is flawlessly controlled first-person, with a distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices electrical veins, mechanical ticks, bureaucratic ink. Syntax modulates with pressure—shorter sentences during storm flashes, lyrical cadence in reflection. Diction stays within poet’s lexicon (“rarefy,” “storm-kissed wonder”) without register drift. No head-hopping; even memories (grandmother’s negatives) are anchored to present stimuli (the timer).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or conflict (“Her words had to rarefy now, become essential as oxygen”). Figurative language is coherent (lightning as prayer, scars as geography) and peaks without muddle. Zero paraphrase loops; varied syntax avoids monotony. Minor deduction for slight overuse of em-dashes in high-pressure beats, but no artifacts dull closure—the final lines resonate cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms censorship tropes through specificity: resistance via bus-timetable contraband, vigil measured by darkroom timer. The “cartography of scars” concept feels inevitable yet fresh, rooted in Mara’s poetic craft. Risk-taking (lyric structure, conceptual repricing of silence) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Voice, setting, and theme cohere into an authentic artistic stance—no derivative templates.</comment>
