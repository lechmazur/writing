<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her struggle between control and release manifests in tactile choices (tying vines, stepping aside) rather than abstract reflection. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously: she rebuilds shelves while sensing their futility. The boy’s question crystallizes her arc without tidy resolution, and her final vow remains unspoken yet felt. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional complexity arises through precise sensory perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara’s shift from arranging to witnessing reconfigures her relationship to agency, with cost legible in abandoned knots and unforced growth. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds through repeated storms, loosened ties, and the jasmine-hop treaty. The linden leaf’s evolution from map to memory to relic anchors causality. Final image (“garden could hear itself through her”) reweights all prior tending as listening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mossy trellis, storm-season air, and soil “bright with possibilities” aren’t backdrop but active constraints: rain dictates movement, trellis offers shelter that enables revelation, and runoff shapes nocturnal inventory. Sensory detail is filtered through Mara’s profession—she notices veins like roads, angles of thirst. The recurring linden leaf charges the final image when pressed to the post. Weather alters tactics throughout, never static.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether care requires control—is signaled early and tightens when storms prune “the town’s certainties.” Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to stop tying knots, steps aside from the jasmine-hop braid, and refuses reconstruction. Cost is visible in relinquished authority (“not an authority, I am a witness”) and social vulnerability (customers find her words “slow”). Coincidence complicates (river crossing road) but resolution stems from her renunciation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the linden leaf’s journey and vine behaviors, not assertion. Central question—“Why did some plants lean toward thunder and others toward stillness?”—receives a non-literal answer: courage rehearses in small bends, care thrives in subtraction. Final image reweights “tending” as coexistence, not command. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers (some customers still find her slow), yet resonance is undeniable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is flawlessly attuned to Mara’s perceptual signature: botanical precision (“veined like a map of untraveled roads”), circuitous syntax mirroring rain’s truth-telling, and rhythmic variation that breathes with storm cadence. Free indirect style merges observation and thought seamlessly (“Droplets clung... like second thoughts”). No head-hopping; even the boy’s nod is filtered through Mara’s lens. Prose modulates under pressure—shorter sentences during rumble rolls, lyrical flow in stillness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: “damp clothes, a habit from years of arranging” conveys backstory, metaphor, and character in one phrase. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is coherent (rain as truth-teller, knots as sighs) and never muddled. Minor deduction for slight overuse of botanical metaphors in mid-story, but closure beat (“garden could hear itself through her”) earns its lyricism.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms the “wise gardener” trope through specificity: plant behaviors dictate human ethics, not vice versa. “Reluctant metamorphosis” as thematic engine feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative shards across storm cycles) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Voice, setting, and concept fuse into an authentic vision—no derivative echoes, only earned botanical wisdom.</comment>
