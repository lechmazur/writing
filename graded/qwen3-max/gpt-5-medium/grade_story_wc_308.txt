<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied through tactile interaction with tools and environment; their historically reverent mindset manifests in micro-choices (tying the arrowhead, counting beats) that reveal a hierarchy of values. Motivation—to navigate without moving—is dramatized through active listening and breath control, not stated abstraction. The final renunciation (leaving stones, keeping an empty cord) carries visible cost and forecloses future skimming, earning Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the canyon’s map is internalized not through movement but through resonance, reweighting navigation itself. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—density builds via birds, bones, breath, pulse—culminating in a decisive cadence shift (“distances fold like paper boats”). Cost is legible in the empty cord and abandoned stones, tangible sacrifices that charge the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The “towers of bone” and “shale pools” aren’t backdrop but active micro-setting: bone ribs act as tuning forks, the black mirror reflects sky better than sky knows itself, and the ledge is carved by wind for patience. The stone arrowhead and skipping stones constrain choice (used as weight, then cast), and the final image hinges on the arrowhead’s click striking “the exact rib I need,” proving setting charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s agency: they breathe into the cord, tune to birds, press thumbs to the arrowhead. The meaningful tightening occurs when the pulse “chooses a path through me,” transforming passive waiting into active receptivity. Cost is unmistakable: surrendering the kit, accepting stillness as travel, with the empty cord as proof of forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: true navigation requires attunement, not motion. The final image—map redrawn by singing, ancestors met through pulse—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Recurring motifs (stones, bones, breath) accrue meaning, culminating in the insight that “time is a spiral winding around bone,” reweighting all prior echoes with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is singular and perceptually precise: every image filtered through the harmonic skimmer’s craft (“weathered resolve,” “appraise its edges with a fingertip”). Syntax modulates with pressure—longer, lyrical sentences during observation; tighter phrases during climax (“I press my thumbs... count the beats”). No head-hopping; POV remains anchored in embodied sensation, with diction consistently rooted in tactile, acoustic specificity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“wind had carved a bench for patience”; “feathers ticked with dust like soot”). Figurative language is coherent (bones as tuning forks, birds braiding the day) and never muddled. Minor density in mid-section slightly slows momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift—closure line (“less alone for having been heard”) resonates without artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Premise—a canyon where sound maps space—is transformed through specific craft logic: skipping stones return measures, birds reveal air grammar, pulse mimics stone. Every element feels irreplaceable; swapping “harmonic stone skimmer” for “musician” would collapse the world. Bold risk in lyric-accumulative structure pays off with crystalline closure, avoiding gimmickry through rigorous internal consistency and emotional specificity.</comment>
