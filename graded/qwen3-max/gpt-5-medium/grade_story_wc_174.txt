<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sorin’s interiority is vividly embodied—his shame over “pickpockets of grief” and tactile recoil from the vellum reveal moral struggle without diagnostic labels. His micro-choice to draft a new scene where puppets write themselves shows earned renunciation of prior exploitation. The woman’s entrance sharpens his arc: offering the stick wordlessly demonstrates changed behavior rooted in prior causality. Flawed yet evolving, he avoids safety-hedging while remaining specific, not archetypal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Sorin forecloses exploitative storytelling by instituting collaborative authorship, with visible cost in lost control and glib satire. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via recurring motifs (stick, dome, vellum) until the final hush reconfigures meaning. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3 (“decommissioned radar dome,” “Sorin,” post-argument). Cost is legible in the shaky puppet penstrokes and open doors symbolizing vulnerability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The dome functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its echo amplifies silence into generosity, shaping how the stick is offered and received. Recurring objects (vellum, stick) charge the final image—the meteor hush isn’t backdrop but active pressure. Sensory detail is purposeful (“chalk marks on echoing floor,” “smoke-hazed bar”) and filtered through Sorin’s guilt. Spatial choreography remains coherent as characters move beneath “ribs” of scaffolding toward healing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ethical storytelling—is signaled early and tightens when Sorin drafts puppets cutting threads, foreclosing old methods. Protagonist agency drives escalation: his promise to “reverse gravity of strings” forces trade-offs (lost applause, shared control). Cost is unmistakable in “hands felt suddenly like tools for theft” and later in relinquishing script authority. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, deepening from guilt to structural change.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: the campfire stick’s evolution from prop to prosthetic conscience answers whether truth survives method. Final image—audience becoming cast amid meteor hush—offers non-literal resolution: ethical storytelling requires shared breath, not stolen sorrow. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “shaky” puppet writing. Central question reframed without statement: power hides not in stories but in who holds the stick.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person plural (“we”) is stable collective POV with singular interior access (Sorin’s guilt). Perceptual signature is distinct: calligrapher’s eye notices “letters curved like fish moving upstream.” Syntax modulates under pressure—long lyrical sentences fracture into terse beats during the woman’s entrance. No head-hopping; diction stays within urbane lexicon even during crisis (“glibness,” “placards”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density—“meteor hush purling” conveys sound, texture, and emotional weight in three words. Figurative language is pattern-taught (hush, smoke, ribs) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in “half-lit epiphanies rose like smoke that forgot its fire” slightly muddles causality, but no loops or scaffold. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the woman’s arrival.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: subversive puppetry meets calligraphic ethics in decommissioned tech space. Tropes transformed—“campfire stick” becomes governance tool, “serene” reframed as earned humility. Risk-taking (collaborative scripting, open doors) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular: critique of extractive artistry grounded in tactile details (vellum glimmer, rope coil) rather than abstraction.</comment>
