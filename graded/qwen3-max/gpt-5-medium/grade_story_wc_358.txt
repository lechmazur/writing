<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The investigator’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—driven by grief, duty, and the tension between foresight and hindsight. Their micro-choices (e.g., hanging the patch as a windsock, recalibrating landing corridors) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The child’s appearance deepens relational pressure without diluting focus. Flaws like overreliance on borrowed authority are embodied, not declared.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the helicopter lands safely, but the town’s hum resumes only because the investigator foreclosed error through precise, costly attention. The causal lens holds—each beat links via “because/therefore” (e.g., wind patterns → tape placement → altered flight path). Cost is legible in the patch’s stillness and the unspoken exhaustion beneath quiet inventorying.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The container labyrinth functions as active micro-setting—it funnels wind, dictates survey paths, and shapes the turbulence that nearly downed the chopper. Sensory detail (mothball sweetness, sodium glare, glass ripples) is filtered through professional urgency. The final image charges the setting: cranes regain “patience of statues” only after human intervention reorders chaos.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preventing recurrence through actionable foresight—is signaled early and tightens when the child reveals the failing generator. The investigator’s agency drives escalation: documenting winds → redesigning approach → guiding live rescue. Cost is unmistakable: emotional labor masked as technical rigor, and the ever-present risk that “the air will be different tomorrow.”</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: foresight isn’t prophecy but practiced posture under uncertainty. The ending reweights the premise—silence isn’t absence but a space to act—without moralizing. Recurring images (patch, tape, wind) accrue meaning through use, not declaration. Ambiguity lingers (will this work next time?), honoring complexity over resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is a masterclass in perceptual signature: syntax mirrors the investigator’s calibrated urgency (“Hazy precision is an ethic”), diction blends technical lexicon with poetic restraint, and rhythm modulates from staccato observation to fluid choreography. No head-hopping; even the child’s dialogue reflects adult economy, reinforcing shared stakes without voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—every line multitasks (e.g., “cranes… stuck mid-salute” conveys image, emotion, and causality). Figurative language is coherent (“dust devil… trained by walls… to grow teeth”) and pattern-taught. Minor density in mid-text (“data will not be numbers… need their manners”) risks abstraction but pays off in tactical clarity. Zero loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms procedural tropes into lyrical causality: accident investigation becomes a ritual of attention against chaos. Specificity abounds (rotorcraft charts, magnetized stakes, charcoal arrows)—no generic placeholders. The synthesis of meteorology, grief, and spatial choreography feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (quiet climax, child as witness) heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
