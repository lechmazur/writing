<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The narrator’s interiority is vividly embodied through tactile, sensory-rich perception (“breath makes halos,” “silt moves as if remembering”) and morally weighted micro-choices (choosing testimony over accusation). Motivation stems from a coherent ethos—“to salvage something pure”—that shapes every action with visible cost. Contradictory impulses (justice vs. gentleness) act simultaneously in scene, especially when the narrator resists shouting the truth. Sofia’s husband’s silent arrival crystallizes emotional stakes without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the community’s collective witnessing forecloses denial with quiet finality (“We did not cheer; the ice would have cracked”). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—pressure builds via rhythmic repetition (taps → dreams → globe → town), culminating in a resonant reconfiguration of public truth. Cost is legible in the foreman’s swallowed guilt and the husband’s quiet grief. Every shard (dreams, dive, shrine, confrontation) coheres under this lens with taught transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The glacier-ice shrine functions as micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: candles echo taps, breath fogs into halos, portholes align worlds. The snow globe’s physical state (melted, salt-jeweled) evolves causally and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—underwater silt “remembers,” lamplight warms evidence—and setting details are filtered through the diver’s ritualistic professionalism. Environment directly shapes tactics: dawn dive, borrowed starlight, ice acoustics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth for the drowned—is signaled early and tightens through protagonist agency: mapping taps, warming the globe, inviting dreamers. Escalation follows an Accumulative lens: beats accrue until the town windows flicker in unison, forcing the company’s exposure. Cost is unmistakable—the foreman’s shame, the husband’s silence—and the final choice (testimony as hymn, not accusation) narrows options with moral precision. Coincidence (dreams) complicates but never resolves; resolution stems from guided communal attention.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: truth surfaces not through force but through patient resonance. The snow globe’s transformation—from child’s toy to evidentiary vessel—reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image (husband turning the crank until it sticks) offers a non-literal answer: healing requires bearing witness, not vengeance. Subtext thrives in gesture (frost-burned hands pointing, shaved head leaning toward light) and avoids binaries—corporate guilt meets communal grace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Voice is singular, lyric, and perceptually precise—POV filters all through a ghost-whisperer’s synesthetic lexicon (“prayers drift like plankton,” “metal coughing”). Syntax modulates with pressure: short clauses during the dive (“I dove at dawn… swam into the ferry’s ribs”), flowing cadences in reflection. No head-hopping; even collective “we” remains anchored in the narrator’s stance. Elision (e.g., omitting how dreams began) is pattern-taught and paid off through rhythmic accumulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“rivet that failed was a rehearsed scapegoat”). Figurative language is consistent and purposeful—no mixed metaphors, no overwriting. Sentence openings vary (“I dive…”, “Most nights…”, “The ferry…”) and paragraph cuts serve emotional rhythm. Final line (“watched the melted snow globe shine… then rest”) recharges motifs without redundancy. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise transforms ghost-story tropes through specificity: truth-seeking via dream-analysis and musical evidence feels inevitable yet fresh. The snow globe as forensic object subverts expectation while deepening theme. Risk-taking (lyric structure, communal resolution) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision coheres across voice, setting, and moral calculus—no safety hedging, no template echoes. Closure reconfigures justice as shared resonance, not punishment.</comment>
