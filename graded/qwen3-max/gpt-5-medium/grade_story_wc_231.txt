<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse keeper’s softly persistent nature is embodied through micro-choices—crouching to inspect planks, aligning the Edelweiss, sweeping the dock—that reveal a hierarchy of values centered on witnessing over spectacle. His internal contradiction (eccentric yet precise, detached yet deeply empathetic) manifests in concrete perception, not diagnostic labels. The borrowed memory of the girl emerges only when triggered by tactile contact with the dock, tilting his present action without flattening pressure. His final act—signaling with light—is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of enduring others’ unresolved grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure arrives as Charged Poise: the keeper performs a ritual that reconfigures silence into reply, crystallizing the dock’s role as archive of unspoken vows. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story deepens through patterned gaps (in breath, timber, memory)—and the decisive intensification occurs when the Edelweiss fits the notch, transforming investigation into communion. Cost is legible in the folded salt packet and swept dock: what is rescued needs no shrine, only witness. Orientation anchors (“opal dock,” “nautical twilight,” “lantern”) are established by line 3 and serve closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The “opal dock in mist” functions as micro-setting: its seams hide secrets, its pilings bear coded wear, and its grain reveals scratches that drive the plot. Sensory detail is selective—brine-ruined lungs, brittle petals, iron steps—and filtered through the keeper’s profession and temperament. The dock constrains choice (where to search, how to interpret) and charges the final image: light swung above it becomes both signal and requiem. Weather and time affect action; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decoding a final gesture—is signaled early and tightens when the Edelweiss aligns with the notch, foreclosing mere curiosity in favor of ritual responsibility. The keeper’s agency drives escalation: observing gaps leads to discovery, which demands response. Cost is unmistakable—“witnessed isolation has a weight… that does not burn but never quite warms”—and crystallizes in his decision to send light not for himself but for the dead. Coincidence complicates (the stranger’s arrival) but resolution stems from character-driven action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme—how silence accrues meaning through witness—emerges from particulars: the Edelweiss, the notch, the three-slow-one-long signal. Subtext operates in inverted gestures (chest then flower) and unspoken histories. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: meaning persists not in monuments but in borrowed acts of attention. No moralizing; the final image reweights all prior material by showing that rescue lies in recognition, not recovery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>First-person voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, eccentric but grounded in tactile observation (“lungs ruined by brine,” “stems settled perfectly into the wear”). Syntax modulates with pressure—longer sentences for reflection, shorter for discovery—and perceptual signature is consistent (noticing gaps, textures, absences). No head-hopping; focalization stays tightly bound to the keeper’s knowledge. Elision (e.g., the stranger’s name) is purposeful and paid off through the ledger entry.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot (“the tide keeps its own ledger of names”). Figurative language is coherent (“dock shone like a smoothed stone,” “mist pulled itself into ribbons”) and never muddles causality. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor density in the opening (“colors hushed themselves to gray vows”) risks slight overwriting, but clarity at closure remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms the lighthouse keeper trope through specificity: his method (“observing gaps”), his ledger, his inherited signals. The Edelweiss—alpine flower on a maritime dock—creates fresh tension between land/mountain, memory/presence. Risk-taking (lyric structure, embedded backstory via “borrowed memories”) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The synthesis of dock-as-archive, light-as-reply, and witness-as-duty feels inevitable in hindsight and irreplaceable.</comment>
