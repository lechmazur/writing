<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrator’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—skepticism and forgiveness coexist in tactile choices like pocketing the tooth or setting Ari’s shoulder. Ari’s shame and Linnet’s “shrewd innocence” manifest through precise actions, not labels. The final renunciation of myth for truth (“tell it plain”) emerges from consistent character logic and carries emotional cost. No diagnostic language; contradictions feel lived, not curated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the decision to narrate truth forecloses the town’s witch-tale and bears social cost (“the town would clamor tomorrow”). Causality flows via Accumulative/Textural lens—each image (tooth, map, bone setting) deepens thematic pressure without forced turns. The cleft in certainty opens early and tightens through discovery, culminating in a Charged Poise where healing and testimony intertwine. Cost is legible in Ari’s eroded body and the narrator’s “ache of repairs.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The hedge maze functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice—its hidden door enables the central discovery, and its breath (“mint and iron”) mirrors moral ambiguity. Tools (magnifier, splints) and recurring objects (tooth, sketch) are handled with tactile specificity that charges the ending. Spatial choreography remains coherent even in lyrical mode, and the garden evolves causally—from secret refuge to site of reckoning. Final image (“stars…bright bones of the sky”) reweights the entire atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus myth—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator chooses to reinterpret Ari’s map “with brighter ink.” Agency drives escalation: each choice (entering maze, examining tooth, setting shoulder) narrows options toward public truth-telling. Cost is visceral—Ari’s dislocated arm, the drowned child’s memory—and crystallizes in the final refusal to let the town’s narrative stand. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: bone setting as metaphor for truth-telling, mistakes as constellations. The ending offers a non-literal answer—mercy through honest narration—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (Linnet fetching water, birds resuming opera) and charged objects (tooth left for roots). Complexity is honored: the town’s cruelty, Ari’s flawed protection, and the narrator’s skepticism all resist tidy judgment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is singular and rhythmically controlled—lyrical but never ornamental, with syntax modulating under pressure (e.g., short clauses during bone setting). Perceptual signature is consistent: medical precision fused with poetic attention (“rings in the dentin like tree years interrupted by frost”). No head-hopping; focalization stays tightly bound to the narrator’s knowledge. Elision is purposeful and pattern-taught (e.g., fragmented backstory about the child’s drowning).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is coherent (bones as stars, doubt as smoke) and never muddled. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence, and there are zero paraphrase loops or scaffold artifacts. Closure beat (“stars…set just so that we could heal”) achieves resonant clarity without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folklore, medical realism, and narrative ethics feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (changelings, substitute bodies) are grounded in human stakes rather than mythic abstraction. Risk-taking—lyric structure, Accumulative drive—heightens emotional precision without gimmickry. Vision is cohesive: every image serves the core question of how we mend what’s broken without lying.</comment>
