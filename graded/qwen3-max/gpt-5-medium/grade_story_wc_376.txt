<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The calligrapher’s interiority is vividly embodied—wilting near dishonesty, craving unsent words—and their micro-choices (refusing to gild the lie, posting the notice) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The postmaster functions as both pressure and mirror, his guilt-bright tin hands contrasting with the narrator’s integrity. Their final collaboration feels earned, not sentimental, because the narrator’s renunciation (“no more leaf-post”) forces the reckoning. The protagonist reads as an individual, not a symbol, with contradictions (hunger for truth yet complicity in silence) that drive the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: candor isn’t lost but archived, and its release reweights the city’s survival logic. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds through pattern recognition (ink droughts, matching symbols) until the collective stance crystallizes at the hatch. Cost is legible in the wilted leaves, dry days, and the postmaster’s trembling consent. Every beat tightens toward the vault’s opening; no causality breaks or teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The greenhouse city isn’t backdrop—it’s a breathing, wilting organism that constrains every choice: leaf-post over paper, damp tunnels over couriers, citronella sprigs as truth-tests. Sensory detail (condensate like punctuation, zinc gutters humming) is filtered through the calligrapher’s profession and emotional state. The toxic sky outside vs. curated interior air charges the final image: survival measured in shared truths, not sealed glass. Setting directly enables the climax—the hatch only opens with the postal fragment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus preservation—is signaled early (“leaves drink the candid and curl from the false”) and tightens when the narrator refuses to gild “moved.” Agency drives escalation: rereading letters, piecing the map, posting the notice. The postmaster’s system preserved order but starved connection; reopening the archive trades control for collective resilience. Cost is felt in the dimming greenhouses and the narrator’s physical wilt—a visible price that shapes the final act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: gilded lies vs. jarred confessions, leaf veins vs. zinc routes. The ending reweights “candor in small moments” not as fragility but as communal sustenance—truth as rain feeding lettuce and the tired. No moralizing; resonance lives in the uncurling leaves and the Pluviary’s name. The postmaster’s “mercy” is exposed as paternalism, and the story embraces complexity: archives aren’t evil, but consent makes them ethical.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is exquisitely controlled: botanical-meets-bureaucratic diction (“gilded-leaf calligrapher,” “zinc-etched postal plate”) mirrors the narrator’s worldview. Syntax varies purposefully—short, sharp clauses during discovery (“I pried it free”), lyrical flows in reflection. Perception is character-specific: noticing tin-stained fingers, condensate as punctuation. No head-hopping; even the postmaster’s dialogue (“mercy”) reveals his stance without omniscience. Elision (e.g., how the map was shredded) serves mystery without obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances plot, character, or atmosphere (“Words unsent collect in my ribs like dust in louvers”). Figurative language is consistent (botanical/mechanical hybrids) and payoff-driven—the “shredded treasure map” echoes the leaf-letters’ fragility. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in the fern hospital sequence (“silent clock” feels decorative), but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Final lines earn their lyricism through accumulated specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis: epistolary tradition meets ecological dystopia, where truth has literal botanical consequences. Tropes (hidden archives, reluctant guardians) are transformed by the calligrapher’s embodied ethics and the greenhouse’s sentient ecology. The risk—prioritizing accumulative texture over causal plot—heightens stakes: every withheld word dries the world. Originality lies in making candor a shared resource, not just personal virtue, with the Pluviary as a radical civic institution.</comment>
