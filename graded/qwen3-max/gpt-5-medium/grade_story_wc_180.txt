<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist’s internal conflict—between grief, duty, and fatherhood—is embodied in precise micro-choices (clenching the ribbon, refusing to open the tin) that reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Mira’s presence acts as both mirror and catalyst without overt exposition. The daughter’s absence is felt through restraint, not summary, and the quartz-eye metaphor ties perception to emotional limitation. Final renunciation (leaving the tin closed) is earned by prior causality and charged with generational longing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard breathes again, vows shed, and relationships reconfigure through ritual—not resolution. Cost is legible in the unopened tin, the absent daughter, and the bell’s new voice. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via layered images (roots, vows, fruit) until cadence shifts at the bell’s ring. Every beat tightens around the central stake—repair as deferred reconciliation—with no causal slippage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains choice: rafters must be climbed, roots dangle where vows cling, fruit weights decisions. Tools (pruning hook, copper spool) and body (quartz eye refracting rainbows) are extensions of this world. Sensory detail is selective—peach-scented ribbon, marble-laugh, rustling husks—and filtered through the mender’s tactile profession. Final image (bell swaying, ribbon fluttering) charges the setting with renewed purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring balance after broken promises—is signaled early and deepens through the shedding ritual. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to climb, tie the ribbon, speak borrowed words. Cost is unmistakable: enduring silence from his daughter, carrying guilt as physical weight (“quartz throbbed”). The tightening occurs when Mira’s mispronounced psalter proves more potent than correct scripture—reweighting wisdom itself under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: repair isn’t restoration but release; wisdom grows from failed contracts and accidental kinship. Subtext thrives in silence (unopened tin), gesture (Mira shoving him), and misused objects (receipt-wrapped ribbon). The final image—vows falling “crisp as pages”—offers a non-literal answer: legibility returns not through enforcement but surrender. No moralizing; complexity lingers in the shared “stubborn curve” of roots, girl, and absent daughter.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is singular, lyrical yet grounded in the mender’s trade (“sap slurred,” “stress lines through rafters”). Syntax modulates with pressure—longer sentences for reflection, staccato beats during ritual. Perceptual signature is consistent: everything filtered through quartz-eye precision and arboreal metaphor. No head-hopping; Mira’s dialogue feels childlike yet distinct (“what made trees keep their balance?”), and elision (daughter’s departure) is paid off through embodied absence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“vows rot fruit,” “ribs” of branches) and pays off at closure. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally (e.g., “Leaves loosened with little sighs” vs. “I told her wisdom is what you trip over…”). Minor deduction for slight over-compression in mid-section (“splicing, whispering”), but closure remains vivid and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Premise—deciduous vows in a cathedral orchard—is transformed through specific, irreplaceable details: quartz-eye menders, hair-ribbon grafts, unread psalters. Emotional truth outweighs novelty; the fusion of ecclesiastical decay and horticultural repair feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric structure, conceptual vows) heightens stakes without gimmickry. No template echoes; vision is cohesive, bold, and deeply particular.</comment>
