<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The map framer’s interiority is concrete, embodied, and consistent—his “methodically curious” trait drives micro-choices (e.g., comparing silent videos, tracing seams) that foreclose paths with visible cost. His emotional restraint (“shielded openness”) manifests physically (closed notebooks, steady hands) without therapy-speak. The verger serves as effective secondary pressure, his shrug and crossed fingers revealing status and shared stakes. Final renunciation—framing the tear as seam—is earned by prior causality and carries thematic weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the chapel’s reopening reweights silence from void to architecture, with cost felt in communal care and historical responsibility. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through layered silences, video comparisons, and fresco breath until the final cadence shift (“vault breathed like a bellows”). Orientation anchors are clear by line 30; causality flows through perception-driven discovery, not coincidence. Cost is legible in the framed tear: “a wound is also a seam.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting functions as active constraint and thematic amplifier: rain-scoured vault pressures choices (damp swelling aligns with map tear), the henge frames spatial logic, and the whispered chapel’s slit architecture literally shapes sound and action. Sensory detail is selective and profession-filtered (“lamps warming peeled paint,” “cold air nick my fingertips”). Final image—map hung by door, vault breathing—charges closure with environmental agency. No white-room syndrome; every stone bears history and consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—interpreting silence with empathy—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: video analysis, insistence on village presence, tactile investigation. Escalation is driven by curiosity meeting physical evidence (seam, breath, names pricked in lime), narrowing options from archival study to communal revelation. Cost is unmistakable: reopening demands collective vulnerability, and the tear remains visible—a permanent seam between known and unknown. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without reliance on external antagonism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: silence as unspoken care, wounds as seams of connection, history as breathable fresco. Final image—the framed tear marking “saved hush”—offers non-literal answer to central question: how do we honor what was hidden? No moralizing; resonance accrues through constellations of names, soft drafts, and careful feet. Subtext thrives in gesture (child’s finger in stone, verger’s failed shrug) and avoids binaries—silence is neither sacred nor empty, but architectural and human.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is singular, perceptual, and rhythmically controlled: syntax mirrors cartographic precision (“rain eats old limestone like a slow animal with a patient tongue”) and modulates under pressure (shorter clauses during descent). POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping, even with verger present. Elision is purposeful (silent films, unsounded blanks) and pays off in closure. Diction stays within plausible lexicon—no register drift—and prose embodies the framer’s “shielded openness” through restrained lyricism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense, varied, and propulsive: sentences multitask (e.g., “Sheep threaded between the stones like needles in old hands” conveys motion, metaphor, and temporal depth). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent (stone “breathes,” silence “purls”). Read-aloud rhythm shifts naturally—from meditative to urgent—without monotony. Closure lines (“vault breathed like a bellows behind the earth”) avoid overwriting while deepening resonance. Minor density in mid-section slightly slows momentum but serves accumulative design.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesizing cartography, silence, and architecture into a fresh moral calculus: listening as restoration, framing as witness. Tropes (sealed chapel, ancient henge) are transformed through specific, grounded choices (video analysis, lime-pricked names). Emotional truth supersedes novelty—quiet awe feels earned, not quaint. Risk-taking (accumulative structure, minimal dialogue) heightens stakes without gimmickry; the story commits fully to its premise of empathetic interpretation.</comment>
