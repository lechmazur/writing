<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrator’s “boldly sympathetic” flaw drives embodied choices—like crafting a reed ear in response to chalked inquiry—that deepen relational stakes. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion manifests through tactile acts (threading reeds, leaning ribs-to-ribs). Farrin functions as crucible, not prop, and their pact escalates from search to shared posture. The final renunciation—dedicating practice, not statue—earns closure with visible communal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the orchard’s “crystalline grammar” thickens via gossip, chalk ghosts, and rumor-weather until the seam’s “Together” reweights all prior fragments. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3 (“marsh-reed sculptor,” “shimmering crater”). Closure is Charged Poise—the living arbor crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (replacing lost language with breath/posture). Every shard feeds the final curve; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard isn’t backdrop but active constraint: its roots pool stardust grit for marking, panes reflect faces to draw crowds, and shattered obsidian shards become lattice teeth. Final image—dusk-blue panes, crater singing—charges closure by showing environment transformed through human posture. Sensory hierarchy (mineral sighs, humming light nets) filters through sculptor’s tactile priorities. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography (fruit-pillar, crater lip) tracks flawlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—grafting into community via shared space—tightens when the arbor’s destruction fractures gathering. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing listening walks over petitions, then reed sculptures over statues. Cost is legible in the “luminescent ache” that only glows when shared. The “repeatable curve” posture crystallizes stance under pressure, foreclosing solitary artistry for collective embodiment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: kinship webs manifest as chalk initials, molasses knots, diver’s coil-rumor—not abstract claims. Final image reweights premise—community isn’t rebuilt by objects but postures (“leaning together”)—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (obsidian seam’s wordless “Together”) and gesture (flour-curve carried by wind). Ambiguity lingers (lost languages remain murmurs) yet resonance is undeniable: healing as shared orientation, not completion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: narrator notices “dark panes” bending void-sun into “humming nets,” hears crater’s “mineral sigh.” Syntax modulates with pressure—long lyrical sentences early, fragmented urgency at twilight seam discovery. Voice remains consistent first-person; no head-hopping despite ensemble cast. Diction (“stardust sugar,” “gossip-weather”) feels organic to a sculptor-poet, never academic or forced.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “glimmering obsidian arbor that used to stand where the orchard faces the crater’s brightest scar” compresses history, geography, loss in one clause. Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors cohere (orchard as grammar, crater as singing bowl). Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors thematic closure—“leaned together again” echoing “repeatable curve.” Minor overwriting in “rumor-weather” slightly muddles, but closure image remains crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms “lost community” trope via irreplaceable specifics: marsh-reed sculpture, obsidian shards as memory-teeth, street-tag as posture. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure, abstract setting) heightens stakes—failure means no arbor, only ache. Synthesis feels inevitable: the “curve” answers both crater’s void and orchard’s fracture. No derivative echoes; vision coheres as singular artistic stance.</comment>
