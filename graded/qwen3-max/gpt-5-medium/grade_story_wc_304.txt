<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief, reverence, and professional discipline intertwine without sentimentality. Micro-choices (cleaning lashes, tuning the radio) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in mentorship and ritual. The final grin and memory flicker feel earned, not epiphanic. Her flaw—clinging to a fringe practice—is rendered with moral ambiguity and personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the narrator accepts the limits of her art (“we keep only enough shimmer”) while carrying forward its purpose. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the aurora’s light, static, and silence deepen into a resonant pattern that reweights stillness as threshold, not end. Cost is legible in the exhausted chip and the sealed archive seed. Orientation is immediate and functional; disorientation serves closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto isn’t backdrop—it constrains every action: floating above clouds, lit by aurora, it enables the chip’s function and frames the ritual. The emerald chip, bier rails, and radio are micro-settings that charge choices. Sensory hierarchy reflects the mortician’s focus: stone’s pulse, cloth on crystal, brush taps. Final image of the shawl-like air ties environment to emotional residue.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capturing a last spark before oblivion—is signaled early and deepens through tactile pressure: the chip must be placed, the radio tuned, the balm infused. Agency lies in attention and ritual, not force. The meaningful tightening occurs when static yields the mentor’s voice, forcing the narrator to accept transmission over resurrection. Cost is visible in the dimmed chip and the guild’s dismissal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: care as a bridge across thresholds, silence as fertile ground, grief as music seeking harmony. No moralizing—the insight “Let them meet themselves kindly” arises from static, not sermon. Final image reweights the premise: death isn’t blank but layered with echoes, and our art is tending those echoes. Subtext thrives in what’s withheld—the guild’s scorn, the boy’s fear—deepening resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Voice is exquisitely calibrated: poetic but precise, professional yet intimate. Syntax modulates with pressure—long, flowing sentences for auroral awe; clipped phrases for procedural focus. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices textures, sounds, and absences like a mortician-beautician would. No head-hopping; POV modesty holds even at peak emotion (“I felt my mouth pull…” not “I was happy”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is controlled: “aurora draped its living veils,” “static rose like blown salt” avoid purple excess. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Minor deduction for one slightly overloaded clause (“barbed with tiny circuits, a whisper-engine…”), but clarity never falters, especially at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mortuary science, signal theory, and auroral mysticism feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (ghost tech, mentor loss) are transformed by specificity: the emerald chip’s ethics, the guild’s skepticism, the brush-tap memory. Bold risk in lyric structure pays off with conceptual integrity—no retreat into literalism. Vision is singular: grief as active listening across thresholds.</comment>
