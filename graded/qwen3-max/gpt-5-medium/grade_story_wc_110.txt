<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The registrar’s interiority is vividly embodied—fear, guilt, and yearning manifest through tactile details (worrying the lens, shivering at “aching” hints). His micro-choices (eavesdropping, confessing publicly) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over safety. The flaw—cowardice—is active, not stated, and directly shapes his pivotal decision to project the doodles. His transformation into “lighter” honesty feels earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: relinquishing control of the narrative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the bandstand gathering crystallizes communal trust through shared sight, with tangible cost—the registrar’s public vulnerability and surrender of evidentiary power. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: pressure builds via layered doodles, culminating in projection that reweights silence into collective clarity. Every beat tightens around the lens as both object and metaphor, and the final image (“truth… gentle enough to sleep in”) makes conceptual cost undeniable. Orientation anchors are immediate and sustained.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt isn’t backdrop but crucible: rain-slicked puddles become “glass throats” that “know,” crystals “chime” as witnesses, and tarps stitch the screen—all constraining choice (e.g., projecting between “rain columns”). Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: post-rain hush sharpens focus on visual/tactile cues (lens, doodles). The setting’s rules—silence, reflection-as-agreement—are consistent and pressure-coherent. Final ripples across shoes charge closure by merging environment and emotional resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—thawing mistrust through transparency—is signaled early and deepens when the registrar’s private eavesdropping shifts to public confession. Escalation is protagonist-driven: each doodle read narrows options until only communal exposure remains. Cost is unmistakable: his fear of “rot” compels risking social ruin, and the troupe/curator’s reconciliation exacts the price of mutual vulnerability. Coincidence (finding the lens) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency lies in choosing how to wield it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: mistrust fractures community, but ambiguous evidence (“teardrop” annotations) rebuilds it through shared interpretation, not proof. Subtext thrives in silence and doodles—confessions wear masks yet demand recognition. The ending offers a non-literal answer: truth’s gentleness resides in collective witnessing, not verdicts. No moralizing; resonance stems from the projector’s light binding “hawkers and children” in unhidden breath.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is singularly lyrical yet precise: “puddles murmuring like glass throats,” “blame pulsed like a negative.” Perceptual signature is consistent—registrar notices light/refraction first (occupational bias as night registrar). Syntax modulates with pressure: short clauses during confession (“Gasps flutter…”), fluid cadences in reflection. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained (he “knows only the edge” of events). Compression (doodles as narrative) is taught early and pays off decisively.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“fingers worrying a lens” implies guilt + occupation). Figurative language is coherent (light/water motifs unify metaphors). Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats (“truth… gentle enough to sleep in”) slightly softens closure’s edge, but rhythm varies naturally. No loops or scaffold; information density remains high without sacrificing clarity. Final paragraph’s lyricism earns its weight through prior specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Premise transforms trope (broken projector causing conflict) via original mechanics: truth emerges through ambiguous doodles read via salvaged lens in a silent plaza. Emotional specificity avoids templates—the curator shields a reel depicting water-sharing, making stakes culturally resonant. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over dialogue) heightens meaning without gimmickry. Vision coheres: every element (crystals, rain, tarps) serves the core question of how communities rebuild trust when words fail.</comment>
