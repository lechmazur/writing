<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The widow’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her grief manifests in tactile rituals (carving, tea-making) rather than abstraction. Contradictory impulses (to remember vs. release, to shape vs. preserve the knot) operate simultaneously in scene. Her micro-choices—refusing to restore the tag, leaving the keepsake tin shut—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final renunciation (“absence, too, deserves a faithful likeness”) is earned by prior causality and resonates as Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): she chooses not to fix what’s broken, crystallizing trust in impermanence. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—pressure builds through sensory density (rain, steam, wood grain) until the final image reweights “here and gone” as a hinge, not a loss. Cost is legible: the scuffed-off name, the unopened tin, the collar that mirrors his absence. Every beat tightens around the central stake without causal slippage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft functions as a charged micro-setting: droplets become lenses that freeze time, ropes hang like molted skins, and spatial choreography remains precise. Environment directly constrains choice—the carving occurs only while the kettle boils, light refracts through beads to alter perception, and the window opening releases both rain and ritual. Final image (“three in sight like a new ring”) ties setting to closure with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning to inhabit loss without erasure—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: she carves not a lion but a collar, works the knot into a scar, refuses restoration. Escalation is textural but coherent: each shaving, droplet, and kettle note intensifies pressure until the hinge metaphor crystallizes. Cost is unmistakable: forfeited memory (shut tin), abandoned restoration (missing tag), and emotional exposure (rain on cheeks). Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: wood as patient animal, rain as teacher, kettle as metronome. The ending offers a non-literal answer to “how to hold what’s gone”—by shaping absence into form (“faithful likeness”) without naming it miracle. Subtext thrives in silence (unspoken words have claws) and gesture (thumb on scuffed tag). No moralizing; resonance accrues through ash grain, steam ropes, and the collarbone curve that becomes companionship.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is singularly percussive yet lyrical—syntax mirrors carving rhythms (short gouges, curling shavings). Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices ropes as molted skins, steam as ropes, droplets as lenses. POV modesty holds; no head-hopping, no omniscience. Elision is purposeful (husband appears only in memory fragments cued by present stimuli), and closure pays off the taught pattern: ordinary details tether the heart, so she carves the collar, not the lion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—every line multitasks (e.g., “kettle is a metronome for grief” advances atmosphere, character, and stakes). Zero loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (wood = animal, rain = teacher, carving = harvesting). Sentence variety mirrors emotional cadence: short thrusts during carving, languid curls in rain observations. Closure beat (“three in sight like a new ring”) crystallizes without overwriting—figurative language serves, never obscures.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Transforms widow/circus tropes through hyper-specificity: grief as woodworking, tigers blinking like uncles, saucer-balancing as trust rehearsal. The hinge metaphor feels inevitable yet fresh—a non-obvious synthesis of blade, collar, and rain. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over plot) heightens stakes: absence becomes tangible via wood grain and scuffed tags. Vision is authentically singular—no safety hedging, no median choices.</comment>
