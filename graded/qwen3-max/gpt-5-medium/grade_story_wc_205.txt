<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The defunct revolutionary’s interiority is vividly embodied—his poetic hunger, archival marginalization, and quiet desperation shape every choice. His contradiction (idealist vs. failed actor) drives the narrative without sentimentality. The shard becomes an extension of his voice, and his final renunciation (“My revolution remained defunct”) lands with earned sorrow. Ledger serves as a sharp foil, but the protagonist’s micro-choices—covering mirrors, pressing shard to temple—reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in solidarity over certainty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: the archive is revised not through victory but through reweighted truth—“ornament as ledger for debts canceled by beauty and labor.” The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, built through escalating sensory density (time as veils, seconds as rain, mirrors sighing) until the shard’s song crystallizes collective memory. Cost is legible in the protagonist’s enduring futility (“a futility minted in my bones”) even as the civilization’s image shifts. Every beat tightens around the ritual of listening, culminating in a decisive public performance that alters institutional memory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid functions as micro-setting: its cornices, ruptured salons, and oxidized iron directly constrain discovery and ritual. Time’s visibility (“veils of years,” “minutes rained”) isn’t backdrop—it dictates when mirrors must be covered and when the shard sings. The crystal shard fused in velvet iron exemplifies object-as-environment, and the storm-lit colonnades charge the final reading. Crucially, setting shapes tactics: scaffolding, observatory slits, and reflective surfaces are all leveraged or neutralized under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming a suppressed history—is signaled early and deepens through the archaeological dispute. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: devising the mirror-covering ritual, staging public readings, demanding a storm in council. Each move narrows options (Ledger’s petition, loss of access) and raises cost (ideological contamination charges). The climax forces a trade-off: personal vindication vs. communal truth, resolved through performance that risks ridicule but succeeds in reconfiguring the archive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: ornament as solidarity, song as statistic, mirrors as distractions from collective breath. No moralizing—the insight “we made, we made, we made, until the making made us equal” arises from translated vibration, not assertion. The shard’s cracking at the end reweights the entire premise: tenderness has a cost, and equality is forged in fragility. Counter-readings (Ledger’s tyranny thesis) are given weight but ultimately subsumed by embodied evidence, avoiding false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is exquisitely calibrated: poetic but precise, archaic yet urgent, with a perceptual signature that filters everything through time’s materiality (“gilt dust,” “breath marks for a silent choir”). Syntax modulates under pressure—long, baroque sentences fracture during storms into rhythmic fragments (“we made, we made, we made”). No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. The lyric compression (“covered mirrors sighed like sleeping swans”) is taught early and pays off in closure, never obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, each sentence multitasking: advancing plot, deepening theme, enriching atmosphere. Figurative language is consistent (time as fabric, sound as breath) and never muddled. Minor risk: “lacquer touched by flame” slightly strains, but overall metaphors cohere. No loops, scaffold, or register drift—even in peak beats, diction stays within the revolutionary-poet’s lexicon. Final line (“sorrow shone, burnished”) perfectly echoes opening tone while deepening resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Premise—visible time enabling archaeological recovery of lost collectivism—is wholly original in execution. Tropes (ruined court, academic feud) are transformed by the shard’s vibrational archive and mirror-covering ritual. The synthesis of baroque aesthetics, astromancy, and labor-based equality feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risks (time as drizzle, mirrors as temporal traps) heighten stakes without gimmickry. Vision is singular: a treatise that is also a poem sequence arguing for ornament as data.</comment>
