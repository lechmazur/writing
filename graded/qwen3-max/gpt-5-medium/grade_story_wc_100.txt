<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The undertaker’s interiority is vividly embodied—his weariness, grief, and inadvertent stubbornness manifest through tactile choices (carrying the lens like a heart, etching his stamp) rather than diagnostic labels. His motivation to “give rest a permanent address” emerges organically from professional trauma and personal longing, culminating in an Earned Stasis that forecloses anonymity for the dead at the cost of his own return to surface normalcy. The final micro-choice—arranging shards until fractures spell navigable routes—reveals a hierarchy of values: remembrance over oblivion, location over surrender. No emotional summarization; every feeling is filtered through mortuary ritual and oceanic metaphor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the library becomes a permanent registry, transforming distress signals into addresses, with visible cost—the undertaker remains below, redefining his role. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, with density increasing via layered images (kelp, glass, tide times) that culminate in the SOR code. Causality is maintained through motivated ellipsis: each action (descending, aligning shards, tapping code) follows from prior knowledge and emotional stakes. The inciting package and climax (beacon release) are tightly linked by the lens’s “salt memory,” and the ending’s dry sigh confirms irreversible change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The underwater city library functions as a charged micro-setting that actively constrains and enables choice: its thin water allows shelf navigation, its tethers hold floating books of distress signals, and its dome groans under sea pressure until the beacon stabilizes it. Every sensory detail—algae light, scraping anchors on bone, kelp-tea harbor air—is filtered through the undertaker’s professional and emotional lens, avoiding tourist cataloging. The recurring object (lens) and environment co-evolve: the dome’s groan ceases only when the lens projects SOR, proving setting directly shapes closure. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite impossible descents, grounded by service wells and card catalogs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—giving the dead a permanent address—is signaled early and deepens when the manual warns of miscalled storms, forcing the undertaker to choose between safety and fidelity to names. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he occupies impossible spaces, arranges mirrors, and taps code despite chased stillness prowling aisles. The mantled thing embodies the sea’s patient killing, raising tension without resolving it; resolution comes solely through the undertaker’s stubborn alignment of shards. Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits return to the surface world, breathing only when the library breathes back—a trade-off that charges the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: rest as location, not surrender; memory as architecture. The final image—SOS transformed to SOR (“stay or rest”)—offers a non-literal answer to the central question of how the dead may be honored without perpetual distress. Subtext operates in silence (voices answer without sound), gesture (etching the mortuary stamp), and reweighted objects (lens shards spelling routes). No moralizing; resonance arises from the library’s lights staying on, a quiet defiance against erasure, inviting reflection on permanence without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is singular, rhythmic, and perceptually precise: the undertaker notices “waterlogged names,” “shelves lean like old divers,” and “chased stillness breathing behind me”—all idiosyncratic filters rooted in his profession and grief. Syntax modulates under pressure: short, staccato phrases during the mantled thing’s approach contrast with lyrical cadences in reflective beats. No head-hopping; POV modesty is maintained (he infers but never declares others’ motives). Elision is pattern-taught (“three shorts and three longs… a staccato shaking of the soul”) and paid off in the SOR code, making the prose itself a form of signal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“I was never brave, only hired to look unafraid”). Figurative language is purposeful and coherent—“chased stillness,” “kelp tea and candles”—without muddle or register drift. Sentence openings vary (“After the mysterious package…”, “I hold the glass…”, “So I go…”), and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional cadence. One minor artifact: “inadvertently stubborn” appears twice, but the repetition serves thematic reinforcement rather than scaffold, and closure clarity remains unharmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of mortuary practice, maritime distress codes, and underwater librarianship into a cohesive mythos where rest is spatially anchored. The transformation of SOS to SOR is a fresh, non-obvious reconfiguration that feels inevitable in hindsight, arising from established particulars (beacon manuals, card catalogs). Risk-taking—lyric density, accumulative structure, conceptual reframing of grief—is fully committed and heightens stakes without gimmickry. Every trope (lighthouse, drowned city) is made specific through the undertaker’s weary, linen-draped perspective, resisting abstraction.</comment>
