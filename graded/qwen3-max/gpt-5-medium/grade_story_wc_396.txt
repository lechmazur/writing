<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The peacekeeper’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—patience as “a stubborn weed,” empathy mapped onto action—not abstract. Their micro-choices (holding the shard to faces, proposing beacon saplings) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Matilde and Harun apply immediate, character-specific pressure without caricature. The final renunciation—to stay a season—feels earned by prior causality and carries the weight of ongoing responsibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the reconstituted sphere hovers “clear and complete,” offering a room where parties see each other without ice at their ankles—a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (guilt as compost, not flag). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds via layered reflections, culminating in a cadence shift (“They nodded, not together and not apart”). Cost is legible in the floe-split “like a page turning” and the peacekeeper’s earned mantle of shadows.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard and shifting ice floes aren’t backdrop—they constrain choice (unsafe crossings, child’s fall through crack) and charge the ending (beacon saplings along floe lanes). The shard and lantern pears function as micro-settings that alter tactics and perception. Sensory detail is selective and urgent: brine, groaning ice, “heatless light.” Final image ties setting to theme—peace kept through practice, not prophecy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring communal trust after a shared trauma—is signaled early and deepens when the mirrors reveal the child’s fall as the “common wound.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing mirrors over divination, proposing paired watches. Cost is unmistakable: the peacekeeper must stay, shadows lace tighter, and both sides relinquish blame-led narratives. The tightening forecloses easy verdicts in favor of walking reconciliation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars—the shard’s absences, onion-skin choices, “courageous anomaly”—not moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (the weighted breath before reply) and gesture (wiping brine, studying ground). The ending reweights the premise: peace isn’t adjudicated but practiced, and anomalies become norms through repetition. No tidy resolution; ambiguity lingers in scattered murmurs, yet resonance is undeniable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature that notices “fruit that held small moons” and “ice groaning like a thing trying to sleep.” Syntax modulates under pressure—longer sentences for reflection, shorter for tension. POV remains stable first-person; no head-hopping. Elision (skipping the actual mirror work) is taught early (“reconstitute via glimpses”) and paid off in closure’s hovering sphere.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is coherent (shard as doubt, guilt as compost) and peaks without muddle. Minor density in high-pressure beats (“ghostly curvature… fuller sphere trembled”) risks slight overwriting but doesn’t obscure causality. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors thematic closure: “practice, finally, is how peace keeps.”</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise transforms tropes: peacekeeper as reconstitutor, not judge; crystal ball showing absences, not futures. Specificity abounds—pear-shaped lanterns, heatless light, tides timing watches. The “courageous anomaly” reframes loss as catalyst without sentimentality. Risk-taking (accumulative structure, lyric compression) heightens stakes and remains legible throughout, culminating in a fresh vision of restorative justice.</comment>
