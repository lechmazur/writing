<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The seed sorter’s interiority is vividly embodied—her hesitation to “prod the leaf” reveals a hierarchy of values rooted in generational craft. Her micro-choices (delaying reach, tilting the moonstone) dramatize tension between eagerness and reverence. The final realization—“what emerges transformed always is the hearer”—is earned through tactile engagement, not abstraction. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion flows through moss, ash, and bone.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the decoded phrase reweights the arbor’s purpose from judgment to conversation, with cost felt in the protagonist’s bodily transformation (“feel taller”) and societal ripple (“radios will sound less like pleading”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds via leaf patterns, monument hums, and ash-sift—culminating in a crystallized stance. Every beat tightens the grammar of memory until the final filigreed stack signals resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor functions as both setting and micro-setting: its roots braid cloud, lichens sip thunder, and bark textures dictate sorting logic. The moss-carpeted understory and slate valley aren’t backdrop—they constrain action (monuments must anchor memory against wind) and charge closure (ash sifting “like sugar” validates the prophecy). Sensory specificity (veined script refracted by moonstone, taste of river clay) filters world through craft-bound perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decoding the past to shape tomorrows—is signaled early and deepens when the leaf’s message demands new monuments for neglected futures. Agency drives escalation: the sorter’s refusal to rush (“haste only scatters”) enables the dust speck’s warmth to reveal truth. Cost is legible in her moss-stained knees and the societal shift implied by pantry blackberries—concrete consequences of her attention.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between memory and prophecy, crystallized in the final CR: transformation belongs to the listener, not the leaf. The birch-bark sentence fed to airstream as “seasoning” rejects moralizing for quiet intervention. Monuments of nutshell and bone button embody subtext—forgetting relaxes its fist only when honored materially. No platitudes; wisdom arises from sprouting pips and sparrow skulls.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is exquisitely calibrated—a mossy lyricism (“cataloging breath and husk”) modulates under pressure into precise action (“tilt it, letting its halo wash the veinwork”). Perceptual signature is consistent: lightfall sifts, leaves stipple air, ash sugars through branches. Syntax varies organically (fragments for hush, cascading clauses for revelation), and the moonstone’s POV-bound refraction avoids omniscience. No head-hopping; single-POV depth sustains the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density without clutter—each image pulls double duty (coal-pale wind teases boughs while signaling prophecy’s arrival). Figurative language is pattern-taught (arbor “remembers every village,” monuments “hum”) and pays off in closure’s filigreed stacks. Zero paraphrase loops; rhythm accelerates during decoding (“paired syllables of knotted radiance”) then breathes in dawn’s descent. Minor deduction for one stacked modifier (“giant silence”) slightly blurring cause.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Originality thrives in the synthesis: folklore (ember-born tree) merges with craft (seed sorting as temporal arrangement) to reframe prophecy as communal listening. Risk-taking—lyric accumulation over plot—heightens stakes by making every leaf a charged decision. The arbor’s smile isn’t whimsy but earned resonance, and “mossy delight” modulates into purposeful joy. No template echoes; specificity (willow pin, bell charm tray) grounds the uncanny.</comment>
