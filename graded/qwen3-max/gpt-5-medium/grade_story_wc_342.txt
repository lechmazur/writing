<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist’s prosopagnosia is not a gimmick but a lived perceptual framework that actively shapes how they interpret the tree, coin, and sky—turning limitation into method. Their motivation (“mirror the sky inside walls”) is visceral, consistent, and deepened by the guild’s vanished promise. Every micro-choice—from reading spines to mixing glaze—reveals a hierarchy of values (truth over speed, texture over face) with tangible cost (time, breath, risk). The final act of signing with the coin embodies earned endurance, not epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the mural survives the blast because the artist learned and respected limits, crystallizing a stance that forecloses escape but preserves meaning. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pressure builds via sensory density (dust motes, charcoal rub, radio countdown), culminating in a cadence shift where stillness becomes active resistance. Cost is legible in the foreman’s raised palm, the fractured blue, and the tree enduring only if “remembered.” Orientation is immediate and functional; disorientation serves closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The tree trunk library isn’t backdrop—it’s co-protagonist. Its grain dictates archival logic (“histories by pressure and tint”), its hollow shelters the mural, and its rings physically interface with the coin. The condemned building’s hush tightens every move, while tools (charcoal, vials labeled “colors of weather”) constrain technique. Final image—dawn glowing on bark—charges the setting with irreversible cost: survival through artifice when architecture fails.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—painting a sky that outlives collapse—is signaled early and tightened by three tests of limit (blue fracturing, time running, stillness syncing with grain). Each deepening narrows options: no guild help, one minute left, breath must match wood. Agency drives escalation—the coin isn’t found by luck but read through practiced perception. Cost is felt in the foreman’s cough, the radio’s countdown, and the blast that folds the world but not the hollow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory as active preservation, not passive recall. The sky has “no face, yet character”—a reframing that validates the artist’s affliction as insight. Final image reweights everything: the mural’s dawn isn’t illusion but endurance, proving rooms can hold horizons when humans choose resonance over rescue. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers (will anyone find the letter?), but cost is undeniable—the building dies so the tree might live.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is inseparable from prosopagnosic perception: edges over faces, weight over expression, pressure over gaze. Syntax modulates with tension—long, lyrical sentences for discovery (“dots and arcs appear…”), clipped fragments for countdown (“number reaches one”). Diction stays grounded (“chalk,” “glaze,” “resin”) yet poetic without register drift. No head-hopping; focalization is absolute, consistent, and embodied (“my breath chooses careful places to be”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense but never cluttered; every line multitasks (e.g., “shoulders confess more than eyes” reveals character, theme, and method). Figurative language is precise (“vines imitate entire forests”) and pattern-taught—fractal logic echoes in coin, rings, and clouds. Zero loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Closure beat (“dawn still glows… bright as a promise”) earns its lyricism through prior concrete work—no purple excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise transforms familiar tropes (last-minute art before demolition, hidden libraries) through specific synthesis: face blindness as artistic method, sky-painting as act of defiance, coin as star map keyed to tree rings. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure, no dialogue, abstract stakes made tactile) heightens emotional truth without gimmickry. Vision feels singular—this could not be transplanted to another setting or character without collapse.</comment>
