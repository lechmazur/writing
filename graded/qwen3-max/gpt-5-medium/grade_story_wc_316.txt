<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s interiority is vividly embodied—“frost after the void,” “mask painted on glass”—and their micro-choice to appoint joint custody emerges credibly from lived numbness and witness. Neri and Rae are distinct through action (Neri’s measured syllables, Rae’s rage-tenderness cord) rather than exposition. Their shared genotype grounds their conflict without flattening them into mirrors. The flaw: the narrator’s shift from passive recorder to decisive arbiter lacks a clear internal pivot point under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: vivification requires alternating current of opposites, not singular custody. Cost is legible in the drained frost—the narrator’s emotional thaw paid for by relinquishing binary judgment. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: clouds rewriting history, static gusts, and river-stone taste deepen stakes through sensory layering, not causality. Orientation is immediate (“barefoot in the floating rock dojo”) and disorientation serves closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo functions as micro-setting that actively pressures choice—sparring floor over clouds, windroom not courtroom—and culminates in the umber tiles dictating role-swapping. The brain in a jar constrains tactics (humming consent, static gusts) and charges the final image (vibrating at role reversal). Sensory hierarchy favors taste, vibration, and breath over sight, aligning with the narrator’s post-ego-death perception. Every detail serves thematic resonance without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness through vivifying the duplicate—is signaled early and deepens when the test reframes as circuit-making, not guardianship. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: appointing joint custody based on observed complementary motion. Cost is felt (“frost inside me drain”) and visible (foreclosing unilateral control). The lens (Accumulative/Textural) justifies the lack of causal turns; pressure tightens through density of sensation and pattern recognition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: wholeness requires opposition held in tension, not resolution. The river-stone password and child-in-river vision reweight “duplicate” from legal object to living pattern needing dual currents. Final image—future “vivified, real, and ours”—answers the central question non-literally: connection defeats numbness. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers (will they sustain the circuit?) without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is intensely lyrical yet controlled—syntax varies (long flowing sentences for reflection, short imperatives for action), diction stays within ego-death survivor’s lexicon (“blade of attention,” “complementary opposites”). Perceptual signature is consistent: noticing taste before sight, vibration before sound. No head-hopping; even Neri/Rae distinction comes through action, not dialogue. Compression is taught early (“clouds pass under... like slow rivers of breath”) and pays off in closure’s “breathed its answer through our teeth.”</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense but rarely overwritten; most figurative language serves pattern (“history rewrites itself,” “statues rearranged into our future”). Minor artifact: “slices through pretense” appears twice, slightly diluting impact. No paraphrase loops or scaffold—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final paragraph’s cadence (“quiet minute the future felt vivified”) earns its lyricism through accumulated sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise transforms clone custody into metaphysical inquiry about consciousness requiring dialectical embodiment. Floating dojo, brain humming consent, and river-stone password feel inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure, no dialogue) heightens stakes by making emotional thaw the climax. No template echoes; every element coheres into singular artistic stance where law, body, and weather fuse into one resonant system.</comment>
