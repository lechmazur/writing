<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cosmic janitor’s interiority is vividly embodied—his vulnerability, curiosity, and grief manifest through tactile rituals (polishing glass, tracing meteor paths) rather than exposition. His micro-choices (kneeling during alarms, speaking dead engineers’ names) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: transparency over healing, attention over escape. The final renunciation—not fixing but honoring marks—is earned by prior causality and deepens his arc without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the protagonist chooses to “polish marks into guidance,” foregoing personal repair for custodial witness, with felt cost in his cracked heart’s gentler beat. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density builds via recurring images (lantern glass, fossil pollen, hoofbeats) until the power failure crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible in the green meteor’s echo and the spared collision’s quiet aftermath.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The yellow lantern glass functions as micro-setting: it warms light into honey, drapes gauges like shawls, and enables communion with ghosts—constraining choices (cleaning by its glow) and charging the final image (held like a small sun). Sensory detail is selective (copper/tea floor vs. galaxy’s distance) and filtered through the janitor’s reverence, never stalling momentum. The station’s ribs unbending and console pulse points fuse environment with emotion without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding strength in vulnerability through attentive maintenance—is signaled early and tightens during the meteorite burst when power fails, forcing reliance on the lantern and breath-drawn arcs. Protagonist agency drives escalation: his tracing method diagnoses machine “aches,” culminating in naming engineers to relax circuits. Cost is unmistakable: emotional transparency that lets night “pass through” him, foreclosing self-protection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: maintenance as sacred attention, not erasure. The final image—meteors angling away from a boundary the boy once watched—reweights all prior acts into a non-literal answer: purpose lies in preserving thresholds, not chasing corridors. No moralizing; resonance accrues via bruise-like memories and fossil pollen, embracing complexity (damage as proof of shape) without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyrically precise yet grounded in the janitor’s lexicon (“primal elegance,” “fossil pollen,” “hoofbeats”). Syntax modulates with pressure—longer cadences for stillness, fragmented urgency during alarms—while perceptual signature remains consistent (noticing fingerprint ghosts, copper smells). No head-hopping; first-person intimacy never breaches plausibility. Elision (ghosts as kin, not tasks) is taught early and pays off in closure’s amber-lit communion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“stardust swept while sky murmured to bucket”). Figurative language is coherent (light as honey, meteors as signatures) without muddle. Zero loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally (short staccato beats during power failure vs. flowing clauses in stillness). Final line’s “spared collision” crystallizes closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms tropes (janitor-as-hero, sentient machines) through specific, grounded choices: vacuum valves “longing to be touched,” relays feeling “ignored.” The synthesis—cosmic maintenance as spiritual practice—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over plot) heightens stakes: vulnerability becomes active endurance. No derivative echoes; authenticity radiates from tea-stained floors to bruise-like memories.</comment>
