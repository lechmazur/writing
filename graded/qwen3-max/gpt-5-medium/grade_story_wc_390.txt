<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Marek’s “logically emotional” contradiction is embodied through precise micro-choices—tuning breath to stone, offering the key—and his interiority avoids diagnostic labels. The seeker’s hunger shifts via physical listening (“shoulders and knees”), not exposition. Their final alignment feels earned because both characters renounce force in favor of adaptation, with visible cost: the weight of shared responsibility. Flawlessly calibrated for short-form depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): two former adversaries now co-stewards, the stone’s purpose redefined from weapon to guardian. The causal lens holds—Marek’s plan (“adapt, not defend”) directly shapes the outcome—and cost is legible in the key’s “heavy” responsibility and the seeker’s relinquished vengeance. Orientation anchors instantly; no disorientation penalty applies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina isn’t backdrop—it pressures choices (skiff navigation, ice as “shy animals” mirroring tension) and charges the ending (“drift-ice knocked like neighbors”). Tools (tuning forks), body (ribs chiming), and Fresnel lens constrain action. Sensory hierarchy reflects Marek’s profession: salt, lamp oil, vibrational hum over visual spectacle. Final beam lift ties environment to emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protecting the stone from misuse) tightens when the seeker arrives, forcing Marek to choose sonic absolution over defense—a trade-off that forecloses violence. Escalation is protagonist-driven: his “vibrational matching” tactic adapts pressure into collaboration. Cost is felt in the seeker’s ache-smile and shared burden; stakes remain viscerally coastal, not abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: storms as “hungry angels,” forgiveness via alignment not erasure. The ending reweights the premise—protection becomes co-stewardship—without moralizing. “Sonic absolution” isn’t stated as thesis but enacted, making need “ring in a kinder register.” Ambiguity lingers (will they succeed?), but resonance is undeniable in their joint work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is immaculate: Marek notices “freckles of dying light,” counts stairs “like sailors count scars.” Voice modulates under pressure—lyric density in setup (“fleshly ethereal hush”) sharpens to spare dialogue (“I know why you came”). No head-hopping; seeker’s POV is externalized through gesture. Diction stays within engineer’s lexicon; no register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ice floes nudged pilings like shy animals” does setting, tone, and foreshadowing in one. Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors cohere (stone as “patient lung,” key’s “cold teeth”). Minor deduction for slight over-compression in middle (“sound poured out… tide washing a mind”), but closure image (“beam as if a rib set back”) redeems fully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse tropes via “sonic absolution”—a fresh mechanic where sound, not light, resolves conflict. “Logically emotional” trait drives plot, not just characterization. Risk-taking (nonviolent climax, female antagonist-turned-ally) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight; every element serves the core question: can danger be tuned, not tamed?</comment>
