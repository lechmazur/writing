<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The shard-mirror archivist’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—nervous backward walking, combative tenderness, and tea-leaf analysis reveal a psyche forged in grief stewardship. Motivation (“to mentor resilience quietly”) intensifies under pressure, culminating in the child’s return and the council’s reckoning. The final micro-choice—corking dusk for the child—shows values hierarchy with tangible cost: enduring vulnerability to preserve reversible exile. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions (retreat as defense of presence) act simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the council’s reluctant stay stamp reconfigures memory’s civic value, with visible cost in the archivist’s trembling and unswept dust. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory density (tea leaves, bruise-light corridor) until the final image reweights “hoarding” as hinge-holding. Orientation anchors instantly (“empty playground swing,” “forgotten library”), and the bottle-of-dusk payoff pays off early setup without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The forgotten library functions as micro-setting: leaning stacks “like listening elders” constrain movement (backward pacing), while the courtyard window channels pivotal light. Recurring objects—the swing, chipped porcelain, shard-mirrors—charge closure: the swing’s metronome-tap echoes in the child’s “returning” ears. Sensory hierarchy narrows during council confrontation (steam script, floorboard tests), avoiding white-room syndrome. Final image—night as “patient verdict”—constrains future action (awaiting next knock).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving reversible exile against bureaucratic erasure—tightens when the council demands proof, forcing the archivist to weaponize tea-leaf geometry. Protagonist agency drives escalation: unstoppering the dusk-bottle creates the shadow corridor that reconfigures council perception. Cost is legible in physical tremors and emotional exposure (“heat in my chest... laid bare”). However, council’s shift leans slightly on symbolic persuasion over concrete consequence, softening the price paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through precise particulars: “recipes of remaining human” counter abstract “hoarding” accusations, and tea leaves’ “unsolved triangles” reprice exile as pivot, not prison. Subtext thrives in silence (“annotate margins of their silence”) and objects (bottle of dusk as deferred courage). Final image—child mentored into resilience “without fanfare”—answers the central question non-literally: keeping enables rejoining. Avoids moralizing; complexity lingers in the council’s “reluctant faith.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: dust “instructs light to fold,” steam “forgets and then remembers shapes of intentions.” Syntax modulates under pressure—longer lyrical sentences fracture into terse imperatives (“Look... not with your eyes”). First-person POV remains rigorously bounded; no head-hopping despite multi-character scene. Voice consistency elevates experimental diction (“geometry of tea leaves”) without register drift. Final line’s “knock that sounds like someone trying to stay” crystallizes the voice’s poetic precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density: “floorboards test every retreat” conveys setting, character trait, and stakes in six words. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light/shadow motifs) and payoff-integrated (bruise-light corridor). Minor artifact: “combative tenderness” appears twice, but second use deepens meaning via embodiment (“laid bare like a ledger”). No paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary rhythmically. Final paragraph’s cadence breathes without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms archival tropes through specific syntheses: “shard-mirror archivist” merges fragility and reflection, while “reversible exile” reframes memory work as dynamic reciprocity. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over plot) heightens stakes—council confrontation hinges on interpretive acts, not violence. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight: every image (swing, tea leaves, backward steps) feeds closure’s “path to rejoining.” Authentic vision coheres voice, concept, and setting without gimmickry.</comment>
