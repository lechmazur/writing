<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “hands into moths,” the “luminescent ache”—and her contradictions (desire for darkness yet seeking light) drive micro-choices like threading cards and descending stairs. Her final act of relighting the wick emerges credibly from her artistic crisis and the keeper’s marginalia. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile perception and metaphor rooted in her profession. The cost—renouncing urban anonymity to steward fragile visibility—is felt in her closing vow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rustling pages, salt-threaded cards, and brine-sweating stones build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands with conceptual cost—she assumes the keeper’s duty, binding herself to unfinished faces. The ledger’s last line crystallizes a before/after: passive observer becomes active guardian. Every image tightens around the central stake of rekindling sight amid fragmentation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The lighthouse library functions as micro-setting: shelves lean like storm memories, the gearhouse’s rust “ticks like a clock,” and the cracked lens “clicks like a tongue.” These details constrain Mara’s actions—threading cards to map tides, braiding wicks from twine—and charge the final image where light “stitches her to the weather.” Sensory specificity (oil, linen, brine) filters through her artist’s attention, never touristy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming perceptual agency—tightens when Mara chooses to descend not as escape but “correction.” Her threading of cards into a lattice deepens the conflict: fate isn’t shuffled but rewoven. Cost is legible in the perished wick she replaces and the faces she now vows to keep. Pressure accumulates texturally until the flame’s ascent widens walls “like a chest during a remembered song,” crystallizing her stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: fragmented reality mends not via wholeness but rethreading—cards as “tiny windows,” light as a “thought breaking free.” The keeper’s maxim (“untangling threads”) reframes artistry as custodianship, not representation. Final image reweights the premise: light isn’t illumination but connection (“stitched to the weather”). No moralizing; resonance accrues through salt, thread, and unfinishable letters.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: Mara notices margins, lenses, and bruise-like aches. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during descent (“rust ticked like a clock”), lyrical flow at climax (“light argued up the spiral”). No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained (she infers keeper’s intent from sketches, doesn’t presume). Diction stays within her artist’s lexicon (“luminescent ache,” “tide-wrack”), avoiding register drift even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “gulls rode the wind like commas” does triple duty (image, rhythm, theme). Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors cohere (thread/light/face motifs). Minor deduction for slight overfiguration in “light argued up the spiral”—personification borders on strained—but immediately redeemed by “thought breaking free.” Final paragraph’s cadence (“stitched her to the weather”) earns its lyricism through prior restraint.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tarot cards as navigational tools, lighthouse as studio, fragmentation as material to braid. Avoids tropes by grounding mysticism in craft (threading wicks, not burning cards). Risk-taking—accumulative structure without dialogue—heightens stakes through sensory accumulation. The “necessary darkness” trope transforms into active re-aiming, irreplaceable to this story’s logic.</comment>
