<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The traveler’s motivation—to understand the geography of healing—is embodied through precise micro-choices (e.g., using the thread, projecting presence) and contradicted by his own walled interiority. The woman’s grief is not abstract but physically rendered (“eyes are archives of low tides”), and her transformation—from frozen ritual to irrigating weep—feels earned. Their intimate geometry yields credible emotional progression without therapy-speak. Both characters remain flawed, specific, and constrained by their circumstances.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the woman’s shoulders “learn a slope that a future can rest on,” and the thread becomes a pilgrim trail through domestic space—a Charged Poise where absence is reconfigured into breathable presence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each image deepens the central stake without causal breaks. Cost is legible in the copper-kelp breath, the dropped quince, the second cup no longer drawn. Orientation is immediate and functional disorientation serves closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The shadowed garden functions as micro-setting: quince bruising fragrant, leaves spending shine, fountain cracked—all constrain mood and action. The palace thread and autumn light actively shape choices (e.g., thread hums when laid along a name). Final image charges the setting: ivy door, stubborn brilliance of leaving things. Every sensory detail is filtered through the narrator’s clerk-of-absences POV, avoiding tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—naming living absence—is signaled early and tightens when the woman asks to “explain his absence so I may sit at the table without drawing a second cup.” The protagonist’s method forces a deepening: projection across slick stones costs him salt-and-brass breath. Agency drives escalation—he chooses to cross the bridge of presence—and the cost reweights the final image. Latitude as antagonist is coherent, cruel, and unresolvable by coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the obituary’s language: “he has died to the shape that confounded him” reframes departure as necessary shedding. Subtext lives in gesture—the looped thread, the unread second cup—and avoids moralizing. The final image reweights all prior material: absence becomes “a small inland sea awaiting tide.” No thesis is stated; wisdom arises from the copper taste of projected presence and quince approving drops.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Voice is singular, lyric, and consistent: syntax mirrors the narrator’s method (“I write by projecting presence into the gaps”). Perceptual signature is sharp—harbor listens like a conch pressed to its bones; grief has seasonality. No head-hopping; even the man in the north is accessed through projection, not POV shift. Diction remains within the clerk’s plausible lexicon—“wolfshead prow,” “crooked key”—without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line does multiple jobs (e.g., “leaves like small coins spending their shine into the hush” establishes setting, mood, and thematic economy). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent—thread sings, quince bruise fragrant, breath threads with salt—and never muddles peak beats. Final line (“spangled with the stubborn brilliance of leaving things”) perfectly resolves the opening motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Premise—obituaries for the living—is transformed through concrete ritual (palace thread, projection) and emotional specificity. Tropes of absence and harbor are made fresh via “latitude” as antagonist and “explained absences” as documentable geography. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure, non-causal resolution) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular: a clerk who measures grief with carpet weft, writes in language “plain enough to eat.”</comment>
