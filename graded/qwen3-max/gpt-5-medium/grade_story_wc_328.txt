<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motivation—to transform bitterness into a cosmic joke—is embodied through micro-choices (planting the arrowhead, singing static) that reveal a hierarchy of values: witness over extraction, laughter over fear. Their internal contradiction (researcher vs. keeper) resolves credibly in Earned Stasis: “undercover simply meant under earth.” The herbalist functions as crucible, not foil; their shared descent crystallizes mutual recognition without exposition. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in wrists lifting with draft, throat tasting tin.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the stair inhales, they descend, and bitterness metamorphoses—not resolved but held. Cost is legible in returned people who “could not rethread their names without tearing,” and in the narrator’s forfeited objectivity (“I stayed on as janitor, keeper, listener”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern intensifies via bulbs’ arcs, seedlings’ leans, until the drain reveals vertebrae stairs. Orientation anchors by line 3: night janitor, underground garden, after-hours.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The garden is micro-setting-as-character: roots climb like Braille fingers, bulbs swing gravitationally playful, the floor breathes. Every detail constrains choice—the drain exhales hours into “something with ankles,” forcing the narrator to sing static, not song. Final image charges closure: morning returns “without changing what it loved,” proving the garden’s rules have shifted. Sensory hierarchy (damp soil, copper-taste voice, tin-throat) filters through cryptid-researcher POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming archived bitterness—tightens when seedlings stand “like citizens” and the drain opens. Protagonist agency drives escalation: planting the arrowhead, singing static, choosing keeper over hero. Cost is unmistakable: returned people’s spines edited, names torn; the narrator’s cover becomes true identity. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each anomaly logged deepens the harmony untamed until vertebrae stairs demand descent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: bitterness archived in soil becomes cosmic joke via metamorphosis. Final image reweights premise—“frostbitten hope that never thaws”—answering the central question (can ache feed back?) without moralizing. Arrowhead’s root spelling names asks for “a keeper who would laugh with them while being remade,” embracing complexity: transformation requires witness, not rescue. No allegory; resonance arises from mint beds, cordless phone, broom-as-cover.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: narrator notices “footfalls that never fit human cadence,” hears gravel weep backward. Rhythmic control under pressure—short clauses during seedling uprising (“They leaned toward the drain”), lyrical flow in reflection. Elision is taught early (“catalog in mind”) and paid off in closure’s charged poise. No head-hopping; herbalist’s dialogue (“keepers sometimes must be kept”) carries private amusement without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density: “laughter kept my cover warm in the cold rooms” conveys tactic, emotion, setting. Figurative language is coherent—garden “breathed like a sleeping whale,” arrowhead “pruned a comet”—and payoff in root-handwriting. Minor density issue: “gravitationally playful” appears twice without new pressure, but final arc shift (“taught by a tongue older than doors”) justifies recurrence. Zero loops; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Premise transforms tropes: cryptid researcher as janitor, herbalist as gatekeeper, arrowhead as tooth-seed. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable—cordless phone confessions taste “of copper and wind,” drain exhales “black peppermint.” Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure) heightens stakes: metamorphosis isn’t spectacle but spine-editing, name-tearing. Vision coheres—voice, setting, theme fuse into singular artistic stance where cosmic jokes lighten soil yet hold weight.</comment>
