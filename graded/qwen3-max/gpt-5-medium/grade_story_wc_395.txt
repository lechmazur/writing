<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motivation—to find where deleted files go—is embodied in obsessive, tactile actions and micro-choices that escalate under pressure. Interiority is concrete (“flashlight everyone forgets is still burning”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The final renunciation (choosing voice over silence) is earned by prior causality and carries visible professional risk. Contradictory impulses—duty vs. justice, caution vs. obsession—act simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the policy lie is exposed through Aida’s ghostly network, reweighting deletion as erasure with moral cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—numbers, songs, patches accrue meaning until they crystallize into a path. Cost is legible in the narrator’s job-risking act and the “warm coat” image of absence made solid. Every beat tightens toward the Sink revelation without causal slack.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The social network archive functions as a charged micro-setting: cold servers, humming backups, and the ritualized Sink door constrain choices and shape tactics. The mission patch evolves from static object to navigational map, directly enabling the climax. Sensory details (“smelled like old servers,” “silence shaped like a missing person”) are filtered through the keeper’s grief-laden attention. Final image—patch printed beside flashlight—reconfigures both objects as talismans of memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—giving voice to the erased—is signaled early and deepens through the recurring numbers’ pattern recognition. Protagonist agency drives escalation: lying to the bot, decoding Driftwood, feeding digits to the Sink. The tightening forecloses compliance (job security) in favor of ethical exposure, with tangible cost implied in “risking my job and the hush.” Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens, culminating in Charged Poise at the memorial post.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme—memory as resistance against institutional erasure—emerges through particulars: denim patches, orphaned playlists, watermark digits. No moralizing; resonance arises from the final image of a new account posting “Still here, still counting,” which reweights all prior fragments as active testimony. The conceptual cost—policy as complicity—is undeniable in the compiled diary of threats and doxxing. Subtext thrives in silence that “answered like surf,” avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is singular, lyric, and consistently modulated: short clauses under pressure (“the gate blinked green”), poetic density in reflection (“echo of forgotten songs”). Perceptual signature is strong—narrator notices metadata like constellations, hears silence as presence. No head-hopping; focalization stays tightly bound to keeper’s knowledge. Elision (e.g., skipping court order logistics) is purposeful and paid off in the gate’s green blink, trusting reader inference.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “spooling its beats into our graph so grief itself could guide me” merges tech and elegy without muddle. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught (beach sweeping, constellations, tide-like waveforms) and pays off cohesively. Final line’s “rerouting the stream across forgotten songs toward memory” crystallizes rhythm, image, and theme without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms digital archiving tropes into haunting myth: the Sink as underworld, numbers as ghostly telemetry, deletion as policy-sanctioned oblivion. Original synthesis—Aida’s breadcrumb trail mimicking Flight 7421’s heartbeat—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric structure, conceptual vault) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision is cohesive: every element serves the core question of where lost things go, rendered with emotional specificity and systemic critique.</comment>
