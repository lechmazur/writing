<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The exiled chess tutor’s interiority is vividly embodied—his guilt, professional pride, and tactile habits (“fidgets productively”) converge in micro-choices that carry moral weight. His contradictory impulses (desire for absolution vs. fear of repeating past errors) act simultaneously during the tapestry unspooling. The final renunciation of a “brilliant sacrifice” in favor of patient pedagogy feels earned by his history and the story’s logic. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest through physical sensation (“memory squeeze my ribs,” “tasted ashes”).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the protagonist forecloses instant redemption to choose incremental healing, with visible cost (“I left only the clocktower pigeons still as thoughts”). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—pressure builds via sensory density and patterned imagery (threads, labyrinth, frozen time), culminating in a cadence shift from stasis to breath. Orientation is immediate (“time-frozen village”), and causality flows through metaphor made literal. Cost is legible in the final overflow of the platinum labyrinth and the thunder’s departure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The time-frozen village isn’t backdrop but active constraint: stalled rain, suspended pigeons, and woven hush dictate the protagonist’s method. The platinum labyrinth functions as micro-setting—its mirrored channels and trembling water directly shape his understanding of droplet-journeys and inform his L-shaped counting. Final image (labyrinth overflowing) reweights every prior detail. Sensory hierarchy reflects his chess-tutor POV: he notices patterns, edges, and stalled motion, not generic scenery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—forgiveness through responsible repair—is signaled early and tightens when he rejects the “satisfying” full release. Protagonist agency drives escalation: each thread-pull is a tactical choice under the lens of accumulated regret, with immediate feedback (dust falls, water whispers). Cost is unmistakable: wrong brushes “taste ashes,” and his final stance crystallizes around rejecting his old doctrine of ruthless efficiency. Pressure coheres without coincidence or off-stage resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of chess strategy, frozen time, and textile craft—no moralizing. The central question (“Can one undo harm without causing new violence?”) is answered non-literally: the overflowing labyrinth and sailing paper boat reprice “winning” as patient restoration. Subtext thrives in silence, frayed threads, and withheld thunder. Final image resonates beyond plot, inviting reflection on pedagogy, remorse, and the ethics of intervention.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is singular and rhythmically precise—a chess tutor’s analytical lyricism fused with exile’s ache. Syntax modulates under pressure: short, knight-paced clauses during counting; fluid cadences during revelation. Perceptual signature is consistent (notices patterns, angles, stalled motion). No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained (he infers villagers’ states through tapestry, never presumes interiority). Elision is purposeful—the “woven hush” compresses exposition into texture, paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or conflict. Figurative language is coherent (metaphors of weaving, chess, and hydrology interlock without contradiction). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; even high-density passages (“water trembled inside its threads of light but did not fall”) avoid overwriting. Final paragraph’s cadence shift (“thunder sighed… labyrinth overflowed… began to forgive”) delivers closure with earned simplicity. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in “fierce repose,” though voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesizing chess, textile, and temporal metaphors into a cohesive moral calculus. The “woven hush” isn’t decorative—it’s the story’s structural and ethical spine. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over causal plot) heightens stakes by making forgiveness tactile and spatial. No template echoes; every detail feels specific to this tutor’s guilt and craft. Transformation test passed: swapping “chess tutor” for “general” would collapse the moral precision.</comment>
