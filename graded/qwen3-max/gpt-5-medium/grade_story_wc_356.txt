<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The herbalist’s ambition and olfactory sensitivity form a coherent, contradictory core that drives every choice. Her internal conflict—between societal fear and personal duty—is embodied in tactile actions (planting the seed, building the cradle) rather than abstract reflection. The final shift from ambition to stewardship feels earned through visible cost: social isolation, sensory ordeal, and risk to communal stability. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest as bodily sensation (“eyes watered”) and micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the village achieves equilibrium only after enduring the corpse flower’s stench—a truth too bitter to avoid. Cost is legible in the flinching villagers, panicked children, and frayed ceremonies that precede resolution. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: scent patterns, doodles, and bridge tremors intensify until the bloom reweights motion itself. Grandmother’s parcel initiates causality that culminates in a decisive, irreversible act with communal consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The treetop village functions as active micro-setting: swaying boards “like breathing,” trembling bridges, and hung pots choreograph spatial tension that directly constrains choices (e.g., planting at the six-rope convergence). Sensory specificity—especially olfactory—is filtered through the protagonist’s profession and trauma, avoiding tourist cataloging. The corpse flower’s rot doesn’t just describe atmosphere; it charges the climax by forcing collective inhalation of grief. Final image of “low thrum of equilibrium” reconfigures the setting’s meaning without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cultivating serenity within motion—is signaled early and tightens when the bridges’ “souring” motion threatens communal cohesion. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she plants the feared seed despite whispers, transforming passive ambition into active sacrifice. Cost is unmistakable—the village must breathe “feral and cavernous” rot to regain balance—and paid collectively in the council’s shared discomfort. Coincidence (the courier’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her sustained ritual of drums and chimes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: wisdom flows beneath choices like rot nourishes rebirth, and serenity requires confronting—not avoiding—bitter truths. Subtext operates through scent (grief as perfume), doodles (knowledge as dance), and beetles (memory as necessary carrion). The ending offers a non-literal answer: equilibrium isn’t stillness but synchronized breath amid stench. No moralizing; resonance accrues via concrete particulars—the journal’s “map of breath” reweights all prior spirals without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is exquisitely calibrated to an olfactorily gifted herbalist: syntax mimics vine-like growth (“doodles travel first… words follow… quiet arrives”), diction blends botanical precision (“spadix,” “ash tea”) with lyrical abstraction (“tide’s thought”). Perceptual signature remains consistent under stress—peak moments narrow to scent and sway, never defaulting to generic emotion labels. Patterned elision (e.g., omitting courier’s dialogue) is taught early and pays off in atmospheric density. Zero head-hopping; POV modesty maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose sustains high information density: each sentence layers setting, character, and theme (“boards swayed like breathing” conveys village physiology and emotional state). Figurative language is coherent—scent “stitches the canopy,” ambition is a “restless root”—with no mixed metaphors. Rhythm varies purposefully: short clauses during bloom (“They came, then the owls, then the silence”) contrast with winding introspection. Minor overwriting in “storm sap” descriptor slightly muddles biology, but closure image remains undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms familiar tropes (wise grandmother, dangerous bloom) through hyper-specific world logic: knowledge as undercurrent, homes hung from patience, decisions in gust-hushes. Emotional truth anchors ingenuity—the real risk isn’t beetles but communal avoidance of grief. Bold structural choice: making scent the primary narrative vector in a visual medium. Every element coheres into a singular vision where botany, architecture, and emotion share the same grammar. Feels inevitable yet unprecedented.</comment>
