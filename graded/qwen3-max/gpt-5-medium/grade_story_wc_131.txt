<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The crawl space dweller’s interiority is vividly embodied—his fear, methodical care, and yearning for visibility manifest in tactile choices (felt pads, chalk routes, cedar cache). His contradiction—longing to be seen yet retreating behind stacks—is sustained without resolution, deepening his Earned Stasis. The girl’s brief presence sharpens his moral calculus without flattening him into a helper archetype. Final renunciation (“he would not step into their gaze”) carries visible cost: joy deferred for service.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the girl finds the notebook, the tape stills, and he etches an arrow—visibility redefined as traceable service, not presence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density (sapphire hush, mothcolored murmurs) intensifies until the outage enables whispers to surface. Cost is legible in his retreat and the ledger of kindnesses; every action stems from established traits and constraints. Orientation anchors instantly (“shadowed library at dawn”), and causality flows through pipe chases, cache, and tape.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting functions as micro-setting: the library’s vents, grates, and atlas case constrain every move. Dawn’s sapphire hush and flickering city lights aren’t backdrop—they enable the tape’s resonance and the girl’s vulnerability. Spatial choreography is flawless: his crawl from northeast pipe chase to grate behind velvet chair tracks cleanly. Final image (arrow near grate) charges closure by merging environment with intent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—becoming visible to those who need you—tightens when the outage lowers “the world enough that whispers could surface.” His agency drives escalation: testing tape, mapping footfalls, guiding hum toward window. Cost is felt in his silent withdrawal despite joy (“heart big as a boiler”). The deepening shift—visibility as crafted trace, not confrontation—narrows options credibly under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: sense memory as key to lost things, service as presence. The blue notebook’s recovery reweights “being unseen” not as absence but as latent connection. No moralizing—resonance lives in cedar-and-iron breath lifting the girl’s hair. Final arrow etched near grate offers non-literal answer: help leaves paths, not faces.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is singular: the dweller notices heat lines ticking, scuff-and-sigh footfalls, dustlavender scent. Syntax modulates with pressure—long, lyrical sentences in observation; clipped phrases during action (“He slid… rose… withdrew”). POV remains tightly focalized; no leakage into girl’s thoughts beyond observable cues (glazed eyes, whispered plea). Voice never slips register, even in peak tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “body a letter folded to fit,” “windows faintly breathed a failing constellation.” Figurative language serves causality—tape “singing a faint itch only his fingers could hear” justifies later hum. Minor overwriting in “mothcolored murmurs that formed syllables then broke like foam” slightly muddles mechanics, but clarity holds. Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances character, atmosphere, or plot.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a hidden caretaker using building infrastructure as emotional conduit. Tropes (library guardian, lost object) transformed by ferromagnetic tape and sense memory mechanics. Risk-taking (Accumulative/Textural design in short form) heightens stakes—whispers only surface during outage. Vision feels singular: kindness as architectural intervention, not sentiment.</comment>
