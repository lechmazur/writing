<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The carver’s interiority is richly embodied—his grief, discipline, and doubt manifest through tactile choices (ribbon use, chisel depth) rather than abstraction. His contradiction—fiercely meditative yet open to spectral guidance—is active in scene, not summarized. The father’s presence tests his ethos without dialogue overload, revealing hierarchy of values: honoring silence over ornament. Final renunciation (shallow-to-deep carving pace) forecloses haste with visible cost—mother’s disapproval, greenhouse creaks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the kite curve completes a Charged Poise where grief’s migration is mapped into stone without drowning seedlings. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the density of recurring images (butterflies, ribbon, hush) intensifies until the final cadence shift (“ash gold evening… single spare curve”) reweights all prior material with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors by line 3; causality intact via ritual logic. Storm tests roof but grief holds panes—pattern pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: condensation planets dictate light, cracked roof channels butterfly congregation, lettuce beds ground the father’s presence. Tools (chisel, ribbon) and body (hands testing names) merge with environment to shape tactics. Final image charged by setting: “dirt path glowed faintly” echoes “skin remembers touch,” tying closure to tactile memory. Sensory hierarchy reflects carver’s profession—sound (glass ribs singing), touch (soil at arm’s length), then sight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering grief’s shape without breaking it—is signaled early and tightens when the father arrives, forcing the carver to relinquish solitary ritual for shared breath. Agency drives escalation: choosing poem notches, adjusting depth based on hand steadiness, retracing wasted curves. Cost is legible in every beat: mother’s gust steers from ornament; butterflies land as “commas trembling with mercy.” Final deepening—“movement is the shape of our collective grief”—reconfigures endurance as return, not progress.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: grief migrates in widening rings, stones bear distances like maps, names need silence to grow. No moralizing—wisdom arises from oar-put-away lines and kite curves. Final image reweights premise: carving isn’t memorializing death but making space for living grief to stretch across migrations. Subtext thrives in restraint—the father doesn’t cry, the carver doesn’t console; meaning sits at the table “without taking too much space.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is unmistakable: glass ribs sing like tide, soil holds day at arm’s length, butterflies are an “orange river north.” Syntax modulates under pressure—longer lyrical sentences during meditation, shorter taps during carving (“each tap as a measured tide”). POV remains fiercely controlled; even spectral mentorship is filtered through gusts and drafts, never omniscient. Voice never slips into diagnostic or academic register; diction stays grounded in craft and kinship.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density without clutter: “names waiting in marble sounded like waves learning to rest” fuses sound, stone, and emotional state. Figurative language is coherent—tide metaphors extend to taps, roots, and returns. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“At dusk…”, “I am…”, “People bring…”, “To keep…”). Final line’s “single spare curve” crystallizes theme, tool, and cost in three words. Minor deduction for one slightly stacked modifier (“sky-borne loom”), but no artifact dulls closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms gravestone-carving trope through specific ritual (poem-trading, ribbon measuring) and ecological framing (butterfly migration as grief analog). Spectral mentorship avoids cliché by manifesting as wind drafts and butterfly feet, not ghostly monologues. Bold risk: lyric accumulation over plot, yet stakes remain visceral. Core synthesis—grief as tidal return, not linear progress—feels inevitable in hindsight and heightens emotional precision without gimmickry.</comment>
