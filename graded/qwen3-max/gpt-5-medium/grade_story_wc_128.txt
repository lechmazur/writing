<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara and Jun’s interiority is concrete, contradictory, and embodied—Mara’s “cautious exuberance” thrums against real risk, while Jun’s whimsy carries purpose. Their micro-choices (forgiving demurrage, curating displays) reveal hierarchies of value with visible cost. The granddaughter’s arrival deepens motivation without sentimentality. Flawed yet principled, they avoid diagnostic self-awareness and feel fully individualized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the harbor’s invisible labor is revalued through communal naming, with cost felt in Mara’s vulnerability and Jun’s shared custodianship. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via gulls, locket, ledger, and children’s bows until the final image reweights silence into song. Every beat flows from the mistaken envelope; no causality breaks. The locket’s return crystallizes a before/after legible in paper lamps and signed names.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The “breezy library under stars” functions as micro-setting that charges every choice: lamps sway during decisions, gulls witness gratitude, the mast creaks to guide maps. The locket, sea-punctuated pilings, and rope bookmark constrain and symbolize without cliché. Sensory detail (lemon-scented note, brass blinking like a moon) is selective, POV-filtered, and woven into action. Final image of “alphabetized” dark ties environment to theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uplifting silent contributors—is signaled early and tightens when Mara risks exposure by initiating the Ledger. Agency drives escalation: her forgiveness of demurrage, Jun’s late openings, their joint research. Cost is unmistakable: secrecy has “taxed the town’s spirit,” and recognition remains “risky.” The granddaughter’s unthrown gratitude and folded notes prove stakes were viscerally materialized, not abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: cargo that sings, splinters fixed with violin resin, bows whispering on roofs. No moralizing—the Ledger’s power lies in its quiet accumulation of debts and thanks. The ending reweights silence as music, offering a non-literal answer: compassion cycles when listening becomes infrastructure. Resists binaries; Hideo’s anonymity isn’t villainized but repaired through collective memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a distinct perceptual signature: salt breezes draw Mara, Jun bookmarks winds. Syntax modulates—longer cadences for reflection, staccato beats for discovery (“Mara knows the hands”). No head-hopping; dual focalization is cleanly sectioned and converges organically at closure. Diction stays within character lexicons; even “whimsically attentive” manifests in action, not label.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: “paper fibers snapping open like sails,” “sea writes punctuation on the pilings.” Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is coherent (tides, music, light motifs) and never muddled in peak beats. Final line’s “kindness circles back like returning tide” recharges the opening without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of harbor logistics and artistic labor feels inevitable: dockworkers tune violins, cargo sings, ledgers become scores. Avoids template tropes by grounding compassion in resin-mended splinters and manifest-combing. Risk-taking (lyric structure, dual POV) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision is singular—economic and aesthetic repair fused through listening—and fully committed.</comment>
