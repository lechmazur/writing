<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The courier’s jittery interiority is embodied through tactile perception and micro-choices—breathing into cupped hands, steadying trembling limbs—that reveal a hierarchy of values: service over stillness, witness over possession. His contradiction (craving wonder yet resisting stillness) operates simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation—holding pitch while mentor remains absent—is earned by prior causality and carries the felt cost of enduring solitude. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through bone-warmth, moth-tremors, and ridge-throbs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the corridor thins, the widow descends, and the courier steps back onto the path—options reconfigured, cost legible in his prickling neck and the pendant’s tremor. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: density increases via sensory layering (aurora hum, marrow-whispers, snow-memory), culminating in a cadence shift where time stretches like sugar thread then snaps back. Orientation anchors firmly by line 3 (“jittery relic courier… aurora-lit ridgeway”). Cost is unmistakable: “he is not there, except he never will be again” crystallizes irrevocable loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its hum must be tuned into, its snow records footfalls, its green hush replaces mentor’s voice. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—starlight caught in pendant veins, air as “quiet that belongs to the end of stories”—filtered through courier’s professional bias. Final image charges closure: ridgeway throbs “like a great heart whose pulse keeps time for the little ones,” binding environment to theme. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography (climb, switchback, descent) tracks cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—coaxing wonder from routine amid grief—is signaled early and deepens when the yew seeds demand grounding. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to ask the widow to breathe into his hands, enabling the corridor’s emergence. Cost is visible in his trembling, the mentor’s permanent absence, and the sealed tube left behind. Under Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via sensory density and ritual precision, not external opposition, yet stakes feel viscerally urgent throughout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: continuance is planted in clefts of ordinary life through shared attention, not grand gestures. Final image offers non-literal answer—“I do not know if I am a courier or a gardener”—reweighting the premise without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (widow’s half-bright face), gesture (pressing coin vs. scrap of song), and object (pendant trembling like a leaf taught by wind). Complexity embraced: miracles have expiration dates; refusal teaches as much as sprouting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is singularly lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature that notices “smaller, stranger sounds of stones shifting” and maps bleaching into sky. Syntax modulates under pressure: short clauses during climb (“I steady my hands”), fluid cadences during ritual. POV remains tightly controlled; no head-hopping, no omniscience beyond courier’s senses. Diction stays within plausible lexicon—no academic intrusions—and rhythm mirrors the ridgeway’s hum, especially in the closing heartbeat metaphor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density: “time stretches like sugar thread” conveys temporal distortion, fragility, and sweetness in five words. Figurative language is coherent—pendant trembles “as if a moth trapped inside a bell”—and payoff justifies earlier lyricism. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor deduction for slight overuse of simile in peak beats (e.g., “lantern cupped like a lit pear,” “smaller and then gone, like a figure in a snow globe”), but clarity at closure remains unharmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise transforms tropes: relic courier becomes gardener of memory; absent mentor’s legacy lives in vibration, not lore. Fresh inflection in “extending brief encounters” via sympathetic vibration—a concept made visceral through bone tubes and yew seeds. Specificity abounds: aurora showing “underside of color,” grief that “chewed the edges off time.” Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure, no dialogue) heightens stakes without gimmickry; vision feels authentically singular, not prompt-derived.</comment>
