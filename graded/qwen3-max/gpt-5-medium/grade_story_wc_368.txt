<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dye master’s interiority is vividly embodied—contradictory impulses (magnetism vs. restraint, curiosity vs. caution) act simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. Micro-choices like tilting the wing to redirect narrative attention reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The donor heart functions as both physical reality and metaphor without diagnostic over-explanation. Final renunciation (“stand near a story without stealing its shoes”) is earned by prior causality and charged with irreplaceable loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes options—attentive posture over extraction—with conceptual cost (stories must be seeded, not hoarded). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout; sun trails, wing refractions, and indigo steam deepen pattern until the child’s jar confirms the protagonist’s new role. Cost is legible in “borrowed tales can burn if you press them too hard” and the heart’s alignment toward “unspeaking mouths.” No causality breaks; every beat tightens the thematic coil.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting operates as micro-setting: the floating rock tea house constrains choice (bobbing dictates rhythm of reception), the blue morpho wing charges the final image, and sun trails dictate spatial choreography. Sensory detail is selective and profession-filtered (“dyes had always been quietly explosive”). The rope bridge, paper windows, and indigo steam are tactile, not decorative. Final line’s “colors almost colors” reweights the entire environment as a liminal space for story incubation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning why people magnetize stories—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s active experimentation (tilting the wing, brewing indigo cloth). Escalation is driven by agency: each adjustment alters who attracts which tales, culminating in the widow’s dangerous accumulation and its resolution. Cost is unmistakable: borrowed tales risk burning, and the solution requires relinquishing control. The “quietly explosive” trait transforms from personal style to ethical method under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: magnetism as posture, not greed. The final image—heart aligning like a compass toward unspeaking mouths—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Recurring images (wing, sun river, indigo cloth) accumulate pressure and reconfigure meaning: iridescence shifts from optical phenomenon to ethical stance. Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and the charged poise of the ending, resisting tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is singular, rhythmic, and perceptually precise—“stories cling to me as if my apron were magnetized iron,” “light arrives from a respectful angle.” Syntax modulates with emotional intensity (longer cadences for reflection, fragmented beats for tension). POV remains tightly focalized; even other characters’ stories are filtered through the dye master’s sensory and professional bias. No head-hopping; elision is pattern-taught (e.g., backstory via concrete cues like the donor heart’s triple-time memory).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is coherent (river/sapphire/light motifs interlock) and never muddled. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; paragraph cuts serve rhythm and revelation. Final line’s “unspeaking mouths” crystallizes the entire textural accumulation without overwriting. Minor deduction only because one or two metaphors verge on ornate (“lavender hush between storms”), but never obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis: dye mastery + story magnetism + transplant identity fused into a fresh mythos. Every element feels inevitable in hindsight—the wing’s iridescence directly informs ethical listening; the floating house embodies liminality required for story stewardship. Avoids tropes through specificity (knees wrapped in twine, ink on knuckles). Bold risk: making silence and restraint the climax. Vision is cohesive, singular, and fully committed without gimmickry.</comment>
