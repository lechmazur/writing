<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his longing, grief, and devotion manifest through tactile perception and micro-choices (e.g., promising “like a fool,” threading the bead on a root). The ghost bride’s contradictory impulses (“lovingly venomous humor”) are dramatized, not labeled. Their relationship functions as crucible: her appearances force him to shift from mechanical ritual to resonant attention. Final renunciation—keeping her vow instead of chasing dawn—is earned by prior causality and carries palpable cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the orchard “keeps its vow” while the protagonist endures in faithful stewardship, foreclosing escape or personal resolution. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—density builds via recurring images (bead, chimes, veil) until the final reconfiguration where “nights kept their vow.” Cost is legible in lines like “completing something and losing something, equal weights across a beam.” Orientation is immediate (“winter-cracked fields,” “greenhouse”), disorientation functional, not accidental.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint and crucible. Its “endless night” forces reliance on sound and memory; glass “arterial with vines” fuses architecture with biology. The carved bead, frost, sap, and chiming roots all function as micro-setting that directly shape tactics (e.g., pruning “like a vow,” threading the bead to summon silence). Final image—orchard warming “its own dark”—charges the setting with earned autonomy, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—awakening the orchard without selfish grief—is signaled early and deepens when the ghost bride demands a promise. Protagonist agency drives escalation: his choice to keep her terms enables the first awakening, then later lessons reshape his method (“press and release like a vow”). Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits personal memory, spring, and closure for fidelity to the orchard. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his decisions under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: stewardship as love that remembers what the self forgets. No moralizing—insight arises through concrete acts (bottling night harvest, tracing names on panes). The final line—“correcting my gratitude to action”—offers non-literal answer to the central question: care is not passive receipt but responsive labor. Recurring motifs (veil, bead, chiming) accrue meaning without redundancy, culminating in thematic resonance that lingers beyond plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is singular, lyrical, and consistent—first-person POV filters every image through agrarian mysticism (“glass arterial with vines,” “sap was our river”). Syntax modulates with emotional intensity: short clauses during tension (“Say it, she told me”), flowing cadences in reflection. No head-hopping; ghost bride’s dialogue carries distinct idiom (“lovingly venomous,” “farmer heart that fed others first”). Elision is pattern-taught (ephemeral appearances) and paid off at closure without confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet precise—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“cinders fell like confetti that remembered the burn”). Figurative language is coherent and purposeful; no mixed metaphors or register drift. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“steam wrote names on the panes like returning birds”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but closure remains sharp. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts; rhythm varies naturally to serve emotional cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms familiar tropes (ghost bride, alchemical garden) through specific, grounded choices: grafting as marriage, sap as river, chiming as language. Emotional truth anchors ingenuity—the debt isn’t mystical abstraction but rooted in tangible past (“carried me from a river where lanterns drowned”). Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure, minimal dialogue) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Vision feels wholly original, not stitched from prompts.</comment>
