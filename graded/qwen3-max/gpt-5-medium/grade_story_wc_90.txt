<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s pacifism, grief, and gravitational embodiment form a coherent, contradictory interiority that drives micro-choices—smiling without fleeing, naming unused angers—that directly enable the climax. Their steadfastness isn’t passive but active renunciation, with visible cost in emotional labor and calibrated buoyancy. The final promise to “only unseal what could be tended” crystallizes a hierarchy of values rooted in prior struggle. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied through weight, breath, and stone.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the narrator forecloses conquest in favor of tending, with felt cost in solitude and vigilance. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds via layered grief maps, shadow work, and calibrated joy until the lock murmurs. Cost is legible in the final image: joy loosens boots, yet laughter becomes ballast, not escape. Orientation anchors (“recycled spaceship,” “last caretaker”) by line 3, disorientation functional to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship functions as micro-setting: its albums, greenhouse, and bulkhead scale constrain tactics and charge the ending. Salt veins from dried tears on photographs guide navigation—a tactile, sensory-specific system that merges environment with emotion. The kwan yin’s tear cools pulse and weighs compassion, directly enabling balance at the lock. Final sprouts in the greenhouse reconfigure desolation into fragile hope, tying setting to thematic closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—opening the dimension without force—is signaled early and tightens through the lock’s weight-sensitive mechanism. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: stitching self, naming shadows, calibrating joy amid grief. Cost is unmistakable: enduring wolves in the head while making room for joy, a trade-off that enables the hatch’s rotation. The lock’s refusal of “half-life” raises stakes, forcing integration over evasion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: pacifism as active tending, not passivity; compassion requiring shadow; beginnings needing both seeds and lullabies. The library of sleeping words reframes apocalypse as potential, not end—answering the central question (Can gentleness open futures?) without moralizing. Final image—tending sprouts while watching heart’s balance—resonates non-literally, reweighting earlier motifs of weight, tears, and stitches. Complexity embraced: grief maps guide, but joy must rise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrically precise, with a distinct perceptual signature: noticing salt veins, gravitational shifts, acetate cracks. Syntax modulates under pressure—longer cadences for reflection, shorter pulses near the lock. POV remains tightly first-person, focalization consistent; no head-hopping. Elision is pattern-taught (“ghostly resolve,” “secondhand shine”) and paid off in closure’s stitched promise. Prose as character: rhythm mirrors buoyancy, diction stays within plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High information density: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is purposeful (“quilt of hulls,” “grief leaves a map”) without muddle. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold—each image (tears, stone, sprouts) evolves meaning. Final line (“watching the balance of my heart”) recharges opening motifs without redundancy. Minor density in mid-section (“shadow work” phrasing) prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis: post-human pacifism enacted through gravitational emotion and archival grief. Tropes (last caretaker, locked dimension) transformed by specific mechanics—weight as moral calibration, tears as navigational tools. Bold risk: quiet apocalypse resolved not by action but calibrated presence. Vision coheres—every element (stone, albums, sprouts) serves theme without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight; no derivative echoes.</comment>
