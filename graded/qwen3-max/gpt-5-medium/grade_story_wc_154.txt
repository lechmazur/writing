<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The translator’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—contradictory impulses (duty vs. tenderness, neutrality vs. emotional investment) act simultaneously in scene. Micro-choices like offering the coral or selecting which words to translate reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The boy’s “shrewdly innocent” perception refracts the adult world without sentimentality. Final renunciation (“we brought ourselves”) feels earned by every prior beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “peace can be pocketed” transforms from naive hope to lived truth via the coral and cast. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of smudged notes, coral grooves, and bilingual ink builds to a resonant reconfiguration where shared anxiety becomes shelter. Cost is legible in the mother’s dry eyes and the uncle’s nod—emotional stakes crystallize without melodrama. Every shard serves the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The atrium functions as micro-setting: mist, vents, rain, and monitors constrain attention and shape translation tactics. Coral and cast are tactile anchors that evolve from relics to active tools. Sensory detail (pelagic syllables, salted wounds, type-like rain) filters through the translator’s professional bias. Final image—ungloved hand holding coral memory—charges closure with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translating unspoken grief into shared language—is signaled early and tightens when the surgeon’s news forces physical contact between estranged kin. Protagonist agency drives escalation: decrypting notes, stitching script, using coral as punctuation. Cost is unmistakable in the mother’s sleepless eyes and the “war-bell dull[ing] to a gong of rain.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: blurred ink, fused words, and twin boats reweight “peace” from abstraction to tactile practice. Subtext thrives in silence—the uncle’s nod, the mother’s mouth shaping a foreign word. Final image (“we brought ourselves”) offers non-literal answer to the central question: reconciliation lives in shared vulnerability, not signed treaties. No moralizing; resonance accrues through coral’s grooves and smudged blue gradations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: translator notices patrol routes in coral grooves, pelagic monitor sounds, linguistic seams in signatures. Rhythm modulates under pressure—long lyrical sentences fracture into terse beats during the surgeon’s arrival. First-person POV stays rigorously bounded; knowledge never exceeds what’s witnessed. Voice remains consistent even in elevated diction (“lotus-hearted ache”), which feels earned by character’s vocation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves near-flawless density: “vents breathe like distant surf,” “rain ticking like type,” “war-bell dulls to a gong of rain” do triple duty. Zero paraphrase loops; syntax varies purposefully (fragments for tension, flowing clauses for reflection). One minor risk: “pacific conflict-zone translator” slightly strains lexicon but pays off in thematic precision. Closure lines (“coral’s memory keeps speaking”) land with zero scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms war-zone tropes through oceanic lexicon—coral as dictionary, cast as archive, anxieties as lagoons. Fresh synthesis: translation as ecological act (“graft new meaning onto old wounds”). Risk-taking (lyric density, conceptual repricing) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular: peace isn’t declared but grown from smudged, bilingual soil. Irreplaceable specificity in Atapo/Reka linguistic fusion.</comment>
