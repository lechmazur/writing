<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The gardener’s interiority is richly embodied—his “blithe” demeanor masks grief, and his “tenderly organized” ritual reveals a hierarchy of values through micro-choices (e.g., kneeling to apologize to asters). His motivation—to decode intentions—is credibly rooted in loyalty to the widow, and his final act of planting poppies earns a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost: he shoulders silence as steward of her secret. Contradictory impulses (levity vs. sorrow) coexist without therapy-speak. The only flaw: minor abstraction in “shape of intentions,” though grounded by thread-decoding actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tapestry’s border reweights absence into truth, with undeniable cost—the gardener inherits moral burden and must mark a grave that doesn’t exist. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; patterned echoes deepen into soil-borne tremors, and the chess clock’s expiration triggers a causal chain. Orientation is immediate (“cobalt silo,” “cemetery gardener”), and every beat tightens pressure toward the burlap sack revelation. Final image—resetting the clock—resonates as Charged Poise: time is now obligation, not threat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting functions as active micro-setting: the cobalt silo’s “listening metal” enables echo-based discovery, and the tapestry’s frayed border physically constrains the gardener’s method. Tools (sovereign case, needle) are tactile extensions of environment, and lunar-gray cemetery grounds charge the final vigil. Sensory detail is purposeful—“velvet unwinding,” “lamplight-drinking thread”—filtered through the gardener’s profession and grief. The poplar’s broken limb and aster ring directly shape tactics and closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering hidden truth—is signaled early and escalates through the gardener’s agency: he chooses kindness over force to untangle knots, follows echoes into soil, and reads threads as verbs. Each deepening (tapestry → burlap sack → deeds) narrows options and raises cost: he nicks his palm, pockets silence, and assumes guardianship. Coincidence never resolves; all turns stem from his decoding labor. The final trade-off—honoring both lover and widow—sharpens moral calculus without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: intention as overlapping silhouette of love and duty, revealed through threadwork rather than stated. Subtext thrives in silence—the widow’s “portable timer,” the empty grave ringed with asters—and the final poppy circle reweights absence as active remembrance. No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete particulars (coins as witnesses, burlap as fiction). The tapestry’s settled silence offers CR: mercy charts what was uncharted, embracing ambiguity without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Voice is singularly lyrical yet precise—“velveteen gloom,” “monarchic sigh”—with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure (shorter sentences during soil-tremor discovery). Perceptual signature is consistent: the gardener notices botanical and textile details first, reflecting his dual role. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained (he imagines the widow but never accesses her thoughts). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“echoes like migrating birds”) and paid off (“echoes reply through soil”), avoiding purple prose.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“lays out tools in a crescent that mirrors stones”) and varied syntax, though occasional overwriting appears (“choir that never finished learning the hymn it loves”). No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor register drift in “grammar” of tapestry border, but justified by the gardener’s meticulousness. Closure beat (“walks away... carrying a story that has untangled itself”) avoids artifact penalties while reprising core motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in transforming tropes: the cemetery gardener as decoder, sovereign case as witness vessel, echoes as subterranean truth-carriers. Every element synthesizes freshly—the widow’s portable timer reframes funerary ritual, and burlap sacks replace bodies to critique performative mourning. Risk-taking (accumulative structure, textural causality) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular: grief as cartography, silence as active preservation. No derivative echoes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
