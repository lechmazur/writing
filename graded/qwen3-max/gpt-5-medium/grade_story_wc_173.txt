<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The courtesan’s motivation—to defy conformity through disciplined chastity—is embodied in every micro-choice, from her gait to her thread-untangling. Her interior contradiction (obedience vs. subversion) manifests physically and poetically without diagnostic self-awareness. The final renunciation—choosing collective truth over personal safety—is earned by consistent causality. Cost is felt in the narrowing window “between sigh and smile” and the ever-present palace surveillance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the city inhales “differently,” reweighting silence into speech. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of image (“threads,” “echoes,” “prism”) intensifies until the bowl hums and looms awaken. Cost is legible in the patrol’s arrival and the shrinking temporal window. Every beat tightens toward the final act; nothing is extraneous or retroactively patched.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The “silver courtyard under snow” isn’t backdrop—it constrains timing, visibility, and sound, forcing stealth and precision. The prism sanctuary functions as both tool and altar, its glass throats bending starlight into actionable rainbows. Snow’s sifting “like slow fire” charges the final image, where frost absorbs pike-sighs. Setting is inseparable from tactic and theme, fulfilling the 9+ gate with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing silenced voices—is signaled early and deepens when guards approach, raising cost. Agency is clear: she chooses to rethread looms despite danger, not for survival but defiance. Escalation is driven by her actions (kneeling, untying, weaving), not coincidence. The tightening “window between sigh and smile” forces irreversible commitment, with palpable price in every taut thread.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: chastity as vessel, threads as forgotten vows, the prism as amplifier. The ending offers no moral but a resonant image—the city learning “how to refuse and still sing”—that reweights every prior echo. Subtext thrives in restraint: touch withheld becomes power; obedience inverted into rebellion. Complexity endures—truth liberates but risks exposure—and avoids binary resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is singular, lyrical, and controlled: “bodily poetic” rhythm mirrors the courtesan’s discipline. Syntax varies purposefully—long, flowing sentences for ritual; clipped urgency as patrols near. POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping, no omniscience. Diction (“lanterns bled tiny suns,” “breath wrote fog on ink-black brick”) is character-specific and never drifts into abstraction or exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose—nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“threads no thicker than snowlight, threads spun from vows…”), risking figurative saturation, but pattern is taught early and pays off. No loops or scaffold; rhythm supports momentum. Closure remains clear despite lyric intensity—no muddle, only calibrated shimmer.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fusion of courtesan-as-librarian-of-forgotten-vows and architecture-as-conduit. Tropes (chastity, rebellion, prisms) are transformed through specific mechanics: untangling threads to unlock voices via underground looms. The risk—lyric density in short form—heightens stakes without obscuring causality. Vision feels singular, inevitable in hindsight, and fully committed to its premise.</comment>
