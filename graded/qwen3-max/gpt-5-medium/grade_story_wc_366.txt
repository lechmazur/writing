<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The keeper’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—contradictory impulses (duty vs. grief, solitude vs. connection) act simultaneously in scene. Micro-choices (stacking five stones, pressing sea glass into palm) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The skipper functions as crucible without overshadowing the protagonist’s earned endurance. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through tactile ritual and weathered objects.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the keeper reaffirms their role (“We are still here”) amid haunting and loss, foreclosing escape with visible cost (the drowned predecessor, the unarriving keeper). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through letters, stones, sea glass until the final image reweights safety as communal ache. Cost is legible in “five stones for love, and one small shell for the keeper who never arrives.” Orientation anchors instantly: lighthouse, storm, keeper.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting functions as micro-setting: the lantern room, sea glass, and stacked stones constrain choices and charge closure. Atmosphere is selective and sensory—fog “like breath around a sleeping child,” candle smoke, salt ghosts—filtered through keeper’s professional intimacy. The haunted room evolves causally (birds arrive with lamp’s death, depart at dawn), and the sea glass directly enables the final thematic crystallization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving fragile safety through anonymous connection—is signaled early and deepens when the lamp dies mid-storm, forcing the keeper to rely on non-mechanical light (sea glass, letters, stones). Agency is clear: writing “We are still here,” building stone signals, choosing to voice letters aloud. Cost is unmistakable—the drowned predecessor’s myth, the ache that “shines enough to guide”—and escalates pressure under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: safety as shared ache, not absence of loss. The sea glass and letter chain reweight meaning—what begins as ritual becomes luminous vessel. Final image (“candle smoke, salt, and softened paper in hands”) offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence, stones, and unsigned pages; no prompt-like thesis statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is singular, rhythmic, and perceptually precise—“warmly observant, like a tidepool holding sunlight,” “wings brushed the glass where fog swirled like breath.” POV remains tightly focalized; diction modulates under stress (shorter clauses during storm, lyrical expansion in reflection). Dialogue is sparse but potent, carrying subtext through gesture and omission. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., unnamed mainland writers) is taught early and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is coherent (“ghosts clung to the edges like salt”), varied in rhythm, and free of loops or scaffold. Sentence openings diversify; paragraph lengths mirror tidal ebb and flow. Closure beat (“taste like candle smoke, salt, and softened paper in hands”) is pristine—no artifacts, no overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse tropes through specificity: safety as bottled ache, communication via stones and unsigned letters. The synthesis of sea glass, ghost-keepers, and communal epistolary chain feels inevitable yet fresh. Bold risk in lyric structure pays off with crystalline closure. No derivative echoes; vision is cohesive and irreplaceable.</comment>
