<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ilya’s interiority is richly embodied—his telepathy with plants, mulberry ache in his ribs, and coffee-stain divination feel specific and consequential. His contradictory impulses (empire paycheck vs. dream propagation) act simultaneously in the climactic beat. The final choice—to play and dissolve the violin—is earned through prior causality (the frostburned woman’s promise, the ferns’ warnings) and carries tangible cost: loss of institutional validation, archival silence. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through sensory perception and micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Ilya crystallizes his stance by playing, reconfiguring the violin’s fate from imperial artifact to propagating memory. Cost is legible in the dissolving neck, the damp strings left behind, and the forfeited paycheck. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story builds density through recurring images (coffee stains, perforations, velvet) that culminate in the final act. Orientation is clear by line 2 (“Ilya stood beneath its dome...”), and the solstice clock tightens pressure without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The velvet observatory isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains and charges the climax: midsummer heat threatens the ice violin, velvet absorbs sound into “ache,” and dome light signals the choice. Micro-setting elements (coffee cup, ferns, bow) are handled tactilely and shape tactics—Ilya places the cup so stains “can hear,” uses bow tension to measure decision. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: thirst, cold throat, brass-coin sun. Final image of “breathing leaves” reweights the setting from archive to living archive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—propagating memory vs. imperial silencing—is signaled early and deepens via Ilya’s tightening bow and coffee-stain reading. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he chooses to play despite known consequences, narrowing options irreversibly. Cost is unmistakable: the violin melts, his institutional future evaporates, yet the city “answers.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of plant whispers, stain patterns, and empire’s “anesthetic smiles” intensifies until the decisive cadence shift at noon.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as living propagation vs. empire’s sterile archiving. The ending offers a non-literal answer—the violin’s song travels roots and streets, waking seeds—reweighting “provenance” from ownership to resonance. No moralizing; subtext lives in image (dissolved neck, coffee-darkened saucer). Central question (“Can memory propagate?”) is resolved through action, not assertion, with complexity intact—the empire still arrives, but the dream fulfills itself beyond their grasp.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is singular and perceptually precise: Ilya notices “gravity brushed its strings with a thousand soft eyebrows,” reads “peasant astronomy” in stains, feels “mulberry ache.” Syntax modulates with pressure—longer lyrical sentences build density, then shortens (“He set the bow... drew a line”) at climax. POV remains tightly controlled; no head-hopping, no omniscience. Elision is purposeful (e.g., skipping museum arrival) and pays off in closure’s charged absence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“velvet eating the sharp edges until only ache remained”). Figurative language is coherent: “perforated destiny,” “ticket stub kept too long,” “sun like brass coins” all reinforce core motifs without muddle. Minor overwriting in “caravans of glass, cold rooms...” slightly slows momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final lines (“promise already fulfilled”) land with earned simplicity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes tropes (magic object, institutional theft) into something fresh: telepathic botany meets ice-violin provenance under solstice heat. Every element feels irreplaceable—the ferns aren’t just set dressing but active chorus; coffee stains aren’t gimmick but ancestral method. Risk-taking (lyric density, passive climax) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Originality lies in specificity: frostburned fingers teaching violin to sing, sap-and-fire taste of melted artifact.</comment>
