<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist’s pacifism, inherited yet transformed from her bounty-hunter father, manifests through embodied restraint (“my hands remember restraint”) and micro-choices like sheathing knives in soil. Her internal contradiction—feeling more than she can prove, striking less than she could—fuels credible endurance rather than action, culminating in Earned Stasis that forecloses vengeance with visible cost. The trio’s arrival tests her values, and her response (“plant your questions”) reveals a hierarchy of mercy over blame. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through tactile ritual (honeyed tea, slate labels) rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dome becomes “a hinge soundless with use,” reconfiguring ruin toward renewal without resolving the father’s fate. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds through sensory density (dust, thorns, engraved quiet) until the rose leans toward memory, crystallizing options. Cost is legible in the father’s absence and the daughter’s ongoing labor; the final vow is felt, not stated. Every beat tightens around the central tension between debt and mercy, with no causal breaks or orientation drift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The glass-domed desert rose farm functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: it filters dust, demands irrigation rituals, and forces visitors to pause at thresholds. The sandbag scrap, roses, and slate labels are tactile anchors that evolve in meaning—e.g., the scrap tied to a rose tugs “the stem toward memory.” Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: heat scorching edges smooth, mineral-tasting water, velvet night bucket. The dome’s curvature gathers starlight like dew, directly charging the final image of continuity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to perpetuate cycles of blame or cultivate mercy—is signaled early and deepens when the trio arrives seeking “the map to grief.” The protagonist’s agency lies in renunciation: she refuses to name her father’s guilt, instead offering planting as alternative reckoning. Cost is unmistakable: her father remains exiled “until blame learns to breathe,” and she shoulders solitude. Escalation is driven by her choices (stringing scrap to rose, pouring honeyed tea), not coincidence, under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the interplay of thorns and gratitude, weight and release—never stated but embodied in how roses “cast more shade than fire” when debt pairs with mercy. The final image reweights the tower’s collapse: ruin becomes compost for seedlings that “shade strangers,” answering the central question (how to live after catastrophe?) without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—did the father save or betray?—but the daughter’s method offers a non-literal resolution. Recurrence of “engraved quiet” shifts from personal steadiness to shared vow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyrically precise yet grounded in the protagonist’s perceptual signature: she notices spines as “tiny sundials set to mercy,” hears derision “sound like thirst.” Syntax modulates with pressure—longer sentences for ritual, fragmented clauses for arrivals (“They name the tower, the dead, and the debts”). No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained (she speculates about her father but never claims knowledge). Diction stays within her lexicon: “frayed with the same exhausted hope,” not academic abstractions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density: “Dust scrawls outside” conveys environment, threat, and personification in three words. Figurative language is coherent—roses as moral compasses, quiet as something that “hums back through wrists”—with no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in “tranquil blaze of calm” slightly muddles register, but rhythm varies purposefully (short staccato lines amid flowing descriptions). No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms post-collapse tropes through the specificity of desert roses inculcated with values, airship ballast as prayer stone, and pacifism as active cultivation. The core premise—a bounty hunter’s daughter tending a moral ecosystem—feels inevitable in hindsight, with every element (sandbag scrap, slate labels) irreplaceable. Bold risk in making plants agents of ethical instruction pays off without gimmickry. Voice, setting, and theme cohere into a singular artistic stance against retributive logic.</comment>
