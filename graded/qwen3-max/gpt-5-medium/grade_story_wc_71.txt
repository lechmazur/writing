<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrator’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—contradictory impulses (to witness vs. intrude, to sanctify vs. doubt) act simultaneously in scene. Micro-choices like leaving lavender or returning the beetle tin reveal a hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile perception (“hands trembled with the weight of tiny vows”). The final renunciation—accepting that aliveness stems from human ritual—is earned by prior causality and displacements.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “some houses feel alive because we give them our pauses…” reweights the entire premise with undeniable emotional cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density increases via displaced objects, pattern breaks at the third house, cadence shifts toward revelation. Cost is legible in the final breath (“felt the house inhale”) and the protagonist’s trembling hands. Orientation is immediate and functional disorientation (houses breathing) pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The quiet bay, salt lane, and crooked steps aren’t backdrop—they constrain choices (where to place the shard, which houses to enter) and charge the final image. Orris root functions as micro-setting: its oil-stained gauze, cracked seam, and warming texture guide action. Sensory hierarchy reflects the narrator’s perfumer-like attention—smell (damp rope, dill), sound (kettle’s whistle), touch (grain fitting the tin). Environment evolves causally: light drawn “through a needle’s amber eye” mirrors the narrator’s threading of meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding aliveness—is signaled early and deepens through three escalating encounters. Each house tightens pressure: the first reveals sheltered story, the second exposes mimicked life, the third demands active participation (returning the tin). Protagonist agency drives escalation—placing the shard, interpreting displacements—and each choice narrows options (e.g., recognizing the woman’s fear of mess forecloses hope for that house). Cost is unmistakable: emotional labor (“hands trembled”), time, and the burden of witnessing practiced absence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from displaced objects and ritualized attention—not stated but embodied in the spoon leaning like a tide or boots angling away. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: aliveness is conferred through inadvertent human ritual, not inherent property. Subtext thrives in silence (“seam of hush,” “souring photograph”) and avoids moralizing. Complexity lingers—houses can be “alive to shelter a story” yet abandoned—without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is singular: a “creeping normality noticer” whose syntax mirrors meticulous observation (“porch reclines a degree more,” “bowl's shadow has shifted”). Rhythmic control under pressure—short clauses during shard placements, lyrical flow in reflection—never obscures clarity. Purposeful elision (no names, sparse backstory) is taught early and paid off in closure. Voice remains consistent, with diction calibrated to a custodian of subtle shifts (“slack, golden interval,” “mild thunder”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“shutters stiff as bitten lips”). Figurative language is coherent and pattern-taught: “hushed blaze,” “seam of hush,” “quiet lightning” all reinforce the core concept without muddle. Zero loops or scaffold; high information density (“spoon leaned toward a chipped cup like a tide pulled by a small moon”). Final line crystallizes the theme through concrete action (“set something down and mean to return”) without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise transforms the haunted house trope into a meditation on human ritual and attention. Every element feels irreplaceable—the orris shard’s “cracked seam” couldn’t be a key or stone without losing thematic resonance. Risk-taking (lyric structure, personified houses) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision is authentic: specificity (cataloging soaps by hour, beetle tin under stairs) grounds the metaphysical in lived detail. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight—aliveness as conferred, not inherent.</comment>
