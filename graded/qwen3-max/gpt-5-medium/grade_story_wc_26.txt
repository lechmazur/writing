<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her sorrow “lean[ing]” like library vines, her regret “luminous”—and her micro-choices (offering dreams, returning the stone) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Ilen’s quiet desperation is filtered through precise physical details (shadow scaling walls, tasting first rain), avoiding diagnostic labels. Their interaction under pressure crystallizes mutual stakes without exposition. The final renunciation—Mira walking empty aisles—is earned by prior causality and charged with opportunity cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s Earned Stasis (“decided she would continue to notice”) carries visible cost (her stored unlived life gone), while Ilen’s shadow reattaches through a Decisive Change anchored by the river stone. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via recurring motifs (stone, vines, reels) until the petal-storm applause reweights hope as active preservation. Cost is unmistakable: “joy arrive[d] carrying luminous regret.” Orientation anchors firmly by line 3 (“blooming library above clouds, Mira kept watch…”).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The blooming library isn’t backdrop—it constrains tactics (vines tighten to hoard shadows; blossoms fall if balance breaks) and charges closure (petals applaud as sky inks Mira’s name). Every sensory detail serves pressure: dew-bloomed pages mirror fragile dreams; ember-hued stairways evoke transience. The river stone functions as micro-setting—its weight steadies wandering, then anchors memory. Final image (name in sky between clouds) reconfigures the setting from sanctuary to testament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving hope’s shape—tightens when Mira trades her unlived dreams to loosen the library’s grip, foreclosing her own potential futures. Protagonist agency drives escalation: comparing reels reveals the shadow’s fraying, prompting her stone-offering and dream-pouring. Cost is visceral: “empty casing where her dreams had been, shaped like rooms she might have built.” The library’s jealousy raises pressure coherently under Accumulative lens—each action deepens entanglement until resolution demands sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: hope as active tending, not passive wish. The river stone’s journey—from Mira’s pocket to Ilen’s palm—reweights regret as nourishment for communal healing. Final image (library sweetening roots with her regret, sky inking her name) offers non-literal answer: belonging blooms through shared loss. Avoids moralizing; complexity lingers in Mira’s joy/regret duality and the library’s jealous sentience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exquisite: Mira notices “colors fade,” “promises soften,” “vines tug sleeves”—a dusk-trained sensorium. Syntax modulates with pressure: short clauses during shadow-search (“The shadow paused…”), lyrical flow in reflection. No head-hopping; Ilen’s presence filtered strictly through Mira’s observation. Voice remains consistent even in elevated diction (“bruised with worry,” “braided river light”)—lexicon matches her archivist-poet role without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “stairways unfurled like petals into horizons the color of cooled embers” does triple duty (setting, tone, foreshadowing). Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors cohere (shadows as birds, dreams as orchards). Minor deduction: “luminous regret” slightly abstract but immediately grounded by “empty casing… glowing.” Final paragraph’s cadence (“dusk arriving… shawl… notice… preserve”) perfectly mirrors Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Transforms tropes (sentient library, detached shadow) through specific emotional calculus: healing requires trading personal unrealized potential for communal hope. The river stone’s irreplaceable properties (shoreline-gray, water-smoothed) drive tactics and closure. Bold risk: making regret nourishing rather than corrosive. Vision feels singular—no echo of famous libraries or shadow myths; every detail serves the core question: how do we tend borrowed sorrows?</comment>
