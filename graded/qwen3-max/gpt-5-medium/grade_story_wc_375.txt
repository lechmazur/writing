<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is richly embodied through charcoal-stained hands, mnemonic recall, and grief-laced hesitation. Contradictory impulses—commercial survival versus buried artistic courage—animate every micro-choice, especially the climactic sketching of the lock. The final decision to bring Vera’s work to light earns its cost: reopening wounds but reclaiming agency. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in graphite dust and crystal echoes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the door beneath home opens, not with fanfare but quiet resolve, reconfiguring memory from storage to action. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds through repeated echoes, fading laughter, and crystalline faces until the final uncorking reshapes meaning. Cost is legible in the blank marble, the broken lock, and the suppressed years. Every beat tightens toward this earned reawakening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting functions as active micro-setting: the crystal cave isn’t backdrop but co-conspirator, its facets holding sketches, its air mineral-cool, its light patient. The harbor painting decoys a door; charcoal stains skin like veins; the strongbox breathes history. These details constrain choice—the lock must be drawn, not forced—and charge the final image: a world “like a painting with something behind it.” Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: touch (charcoal, stone), sound (echoes), then violet-green glow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rectifying stolen courage—is signaled early and deepens when the lock resists memory alone. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: humming faces into darkness, sketching tumblers whole, blowing dust like pollen. Cost is felt in Vera’s blank tombstone and the economy of survival that silenced art. One tightening suffices: knowledge fails, so portraiture becomes key—a trade of memory for creation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory must serve action, not hoard ghosts. The jar of dawn-pigment and crystal faces nodding “as if relieved” offer non-literal resolution—no moralizing, only resonance. Subtext thrives in what’s unsaid: Vera’s burial under blank marble critiques erasure of strange makers. Final image reweights all prior sketches: they were seeds, not souvenirs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is singular, lyrical yet precise—“auroral sorrow,” “laughter that clung to the rafters,” “warm tinnitus.” First-person POV stays tightly focalized; perception filters everything through charcoal-fingered craft. Syntax modulates with pressure: short clauses descend stairs, longer ones bloom in the cave. No head-hopping; no register drift. The prose *is* the character’s mind—mnemonic, visual, tactile.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense, musical, and purposeful, though occasionally over-figured (“auroral sorrow,” “warm tinnitus”) risks slight opacity. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor deduction for two adjacent lines repeating “after the last echo of laughter fades”—a deliberate echo, yet borders paraphrase-loop. Otherwise, rhythm varies, verbs are strong, and black dust travels “like pollen” with perfect control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis: grief, artistry, and subterranean magic fuse into a fresh mythos where portraiture unlocks reality. The crystal cave storing sketched faces is both haunting and logical within the world. Risk-taking—non-causal resolution via drawing a lock—heightens stakes without gimmickry. No template echoes; specificity (mnemonic gift, broken combo lock, harbor decoy) makes premise irreplaceable.</comment>
