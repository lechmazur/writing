<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lida’s motivation—to evolve tradition with intent—is embodied in every micro-choice, from defying the council to decoding the kite. Her internal contradiction (respect for heritage vs. rejection of implanted destiny) operates simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The final act of unsealing carries visible cost: isolation, defiance of oath, and physical vulnerability (“knees to memory”). No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rooted in tactile detail (wet loaf amber, sulfur wind).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: destiny becomes a shared tool, not an implanted nail. Cost is legible in Lida’s solitary descent and the council’s refusal—her choice forecloses communal sanction but enables children’s laughter on new walkways. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: plant whispers, steam, and amber coalesce into a resonant reconfiguration. Every beat tightens pressure toward the unsealing, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The volcanic hot springs function as micro-setting that constrains and charges: steam mirrors fire water, porous rock receives roots, vault stairs pulse with ivy. Sensory hierarchy reflects Lida’s urgency—sulfur wind, gray water bubbles, wet stone pitch—never tourist catalog. Final image (seedling rooted by her knee) reweights the bathhouse reconstruction as living tradition. Environment actively shapes tactics: only here can amber soften in “mirror of fire water.”</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—evolving tradition versus passive preservation—is signaled early and deepens when the council refuses the kite’s method. Lida’s agency drives escalation: she acts alone after dialogue fails, bearing physical and social cost. The tightening forecloses communal consensus but opens intergenerational stewardship. Coincidence (fallen kite) complicates but doesn’t resolve; decoding requires her insurgent literacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: nails in seed, trellis bending, children steering. The ending reweights “implanted destiny” as collective intent without stating a moral—the vine chooses her palm, not fate. Subtext thrives in plant whispers and kite script; no sermonizing. Central question (“Who steers tradition?”) answered non-literally by scaffolded walkways built by morning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Lida notices plants’ strategic whispers, not just beauty. Rhythmic control under pressure—short clauses during vault descent (“ivy guided… pulse lock like a friend”) contrast lyrical density at climax. First-person plural (“our insurgent grandmother”) deepens collective stakes without head-hopping. Voice remains consistent: botanical lexicon fused with resistance idiom (“soft net,” “mince of syllables”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High information density: “amber softened like honey” conveys texture, transformation, and time. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“Steam rose…”, “She went…”, “At dusk…”). Figurative coherence: nails, trellis, roots form a consistent motif system. Minor overwriting in “braid of futures offered”—slightly abstract—but immediately grounded by “hungry for chosen intent.”</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: telepathic botany meets post-occupation cultural repair. Tropes transformed—embryo in amber isn’t MacGuffin but contested heritage; kite isn’t toy but insurgent cipher. Specificity abounds: scarlet moss relays code, basalt paths guide rebellion. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over causality) heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure feels inevitable yet surprising.</comment>
