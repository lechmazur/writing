<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The translator’s interiority is vividly embodied—contradictory impulses (stillness while moving, witnessing without consuming) manifest in precise micro-choices like pressing the lens to canvas or swallowing recovered names. Her motivation—to honor overlooked histories—is dramatized through tactile engagement with pigment and silence, not exposition. The painter functions as a crucible: his shrug forces her to act alone, deepening her agency. Final renunciation of “a third world” by refusing to drink cements earned stasis with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the recovered name reweights anonymity into presence, altering how all prior images read. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via sensory coordinates (tar, iron, hush), culminating in letters rising “like fish.” Cost is legible when the market “tilts” at the painter’s dismissal and again when she “swallowed two worlds.” Every beat tightens toward the final act of writing the name on sailcloth, foreclosing erasure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The alchemist’s market isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint: rope bridges “sigh,” stalls trade “zeroed maps,” and suspended geography demands stillness to perceive. The lighthouse lens fragment functions as micro-setting, its “elusively tangible” nature shaping how light fractures meaning. Final image charges closure: pressing the cool edge to canvas margin triggers the emergence of letters. Sensory hierarchy (salt, soot, resin) filters everything through the translator’s professional attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering erased histories—is signaled early and escalates when the painting “releases a breath that borrowed my lungs,” forcing deeper immersion. Protagonist agency drives every turn: choosing the unsellable canvas, holding the lens, speaking coordinates. Cost crystallizes when she refuses the vendor’s steam (“did not want a third”), sacrificing sustenance for fidelity. The tightening—from observation to embodiment to naming—narrows options until only one act remains.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: absence as harbor, hooks embodying “hunger” and “mercy,” crane silhouettes preserving wrist-tilt memory. No moralizing—resonance accrues via the child mending rope while the sea “practiced forgetting her.” Final image reweights the premise: anonymity drowns until a name is spoken, making erasure socially costly. The lighthouse that “never existed” becomes real through witness, answering the central question—how do we honor what books omit?—through action, not assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is inseparable from character: syntax mirrors “between-worlds” perception (“skylines say to shadows”), diction blends archaic (“ferments of moonlight”) and visceral (“tasted old resin”). Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices texture over plot, scent over speech. No head-hopping; even the painter’s laugh (“like oars in their locks”) is filtered through her translator’s ear. Rhythmic control under pressure peaks when “letters rose like fish”—compression without loss of clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density: “dried thunder, ferments of moonlight, and zeroed maps” establishes economy and strangeness in one phrase. Figurative language is coherent—light “tastes,” fissures become “cartographies,” wind “braids” with voice—all obeying the story’s physics. Minor deduction for slight overuse of lyrical abstraction in mid-text (“anchors of intuition tightened”), but closure remains sharp. Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesizing translation, alchemy, and historiography into a single sensory act. The “between-worlds translator” trope is transformed by grounding it in pigment, salt, and rope—not magic. Risk-taking (naming as nourishment, unsellable truth) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Every detail feels irreplaceable: the crane silhouettes remembering wrist-tilt could not exist in another story. Vision is singular—quietly radical in asserting that recovery requires borrowing sight, not just recording facts.</comment>
