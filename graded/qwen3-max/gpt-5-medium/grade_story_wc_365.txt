<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. dread, agency vs. inherited silence) act simultaneously during the terminal sequence. The child-self’s hesitation and the adult’s acceptance form a layered emotional arc without diagnostic labels. Every micro-choice (pressing the shard, redirecting breath, refusing erasure) reveals a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The mother’s absence functions as crucible, her silence refracted through memory and metal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist integrates the withheld truth (she redirected fuel) into her cartography, transforming guilt into guidance. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—smell, shard, and rhythm cohere across shards until the final image reweights all prior material. Cost is legible in “the weight arrived as a smell” and “fold her into the chart.” Orientation is deliberately disoriented early but pays off at closure; no penalty applies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The repair bay functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges every choice—the chains, frost, console, and spatial echoes directly shape perception and action. Sensory detail is filtered through the mapmaker’s profession: ozone, coolant coughs, and hush are not backdrop but data. The green shard and terminal serve as tools that alter tactics. Final image (“lanterns for them”) ties setting to closure with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering the weight of a withheld truth—tightens decisively when the protagonist sees her own hand press REDIRECT. Agency drives escalation: she actively splices coordinates, tunes the shard, and chooses not to erase. Cost is unmistakable: inheriting her mother’s burden of love-terror, then redirecting it outward. The “cyclically spontaneous” rhythm deepens pressure by linking past and present choices under one pattern.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the shard’s refraction, the bay’s memory, and cartography-as-survival—not stated but woven. The final image offers a non-literal answer: truth isn’t erased but mapped into survivable routes. Moral complexity abides—no blame, no forgiveness, only integration. Subtext thrives in silence, deletion, and redirected pulses; the story resists tidy resolution while affirming responsibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is singular, rhythmic, and perceptually precise—syntax mirrors weaving (“I listen, then I leap”), diction stays within the mapmaker’s lexicon, and POV modesty holds. No head-hopping; even parallel universes are filtered through one consciousness. Compression is taught early (“weaving between worlds”) and paid off in closure. Prose modulates under pressure: short clauses during revelation, lyrical flow in reflection—always voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High information density: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph cuts create visual cadence. Figurative language is consistent (light as liquid, scent as map) without muddle. Minor overwriting in “planetary aurora poured into cheap tempered glass” slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts impair clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis: sensory cartography + multiversal memory + parental silence creates a fresh emotional physics. Tropes (spaceport, evacuation, heirloom shard) are transformed by specific rules—smell precedes color across worlds, maps are woven from vibration. Risk-taking (non-causal structure, abstract stakes) heightens meaning without gimmickry. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight, anchored in irreplaceable details like “freckles” and “fuel couplers sigh.”</comment>
