<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sable’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—her guilt, professional rigor, and emotional numbness coexist without tidy resolution. Her micro-choice to smudge the illustration embodies her confrontation with irrecoverable uncertainty. The swallowed truth functions as both flaw and burden, driving credible endurance rather than catharsis. Final renunciation (“I saw it. I said nothing”) earns its cost through prior causality and embodied hesitation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Sable endures the weight of her silence, crystallizing a stance that forecloses denial. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story deepens through sensory and emotional density, not causal turns. Cost is legible in the ink-smudged saxifrage and the stone “becoming something she could carry.” Orientation is immediate; the fever-break dawn anchors time, place, and POV by line one.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mountain weather station isn’t backdrop—it’s a crucible that constrains action (isolation, altitude, instruments) and charges the final image. The botanical illustration, cold tea, barograph, and auroral light all function as micro-setting elements that shape perception and choice. Sensory detail is filtered through Sable’s meteorological precision and grief, avoiding cliché. The smudged petal directly reweights the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reckoning with withheld knowledge—is signaled early and tightens when Sable touches the illustration, blurring certainty. Agency manifests as attention and endurance, not action; her choice to write the truth in the margin narrows her future self-deception. Cost is unmistakable: the stone becomes bearable only after public acknowledgment. Escalation arises from protagonist-driven introspection under coherent atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between measurable data and ungovernable guilt—certainty as weather system, not fixed point. The smudged saxifrage reweights all prior observation, transforming scientific rigor into moral ambiguity. No moralizing; resonance accrues via concrete particulars (ink, barograph, margins). Final image offers non-literal answer: truth isn’t recorded—it’s carried.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—meteorological lexicon fused with lyrical grief (“auroral and sorrowful,” “fault-tolerant”). Perceptual signature is consistent: Sable notices pressure drops before emotions, tools before people. Syntax modulates under stress (shorter clauses during fever recall). No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained—she infers Ren’s fate but never presumes his thoughts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“certainty sways,” “stone in her throat”) and paid off in the smudge. Zero paraphrase loops; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Final line (“carry in daylight, in the open”) recharges “margins” motif without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms oracle trope through scientific specificity and moral ambiguity. “Fault-tolerant” reframes prophecy as probabilistic ethics. Risk-taking in lyric structure pays off: fever, illustration, and margin-writing cohere into a singular artistic stance. Fresh synthesis—meteorology as grief-work—feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
