<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is vividly embodied—her sensitivity isn’t just stated but shown through tactile perception and emotional cost (“hearing too much” as both burden and gift). Her final declaration, “I’m finishing it,” emerges organically from inherited trauma and personal revelation, not epiphany. The micro-choice to speak rather than merely listen crystallizes her stance with visible emotional weight. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions (curse/gift, legacy/burden) pulse through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the walls don’t dream—they remember—and Maren’s act of speaking reweights silence into dialogue across generations. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through sensory echoes, diary fragments, and the film negative until the final cadence shift (“she spoke”) reconfigures meaning. Cost is legible in the family’s erasure and Maren’s acceptance of its weight. Orientation is immediate and functional disorientation (ivy-veiled passage) pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (only accessible through decay) and charges the final image (ivy trembles in response). Sensory hierarchy reflects Maren’s profession: acoustics over visuals, damp stone under palm, charred paper texture. Salt air, buckled floors, and fog ground climate shifts without exposition. The recurring brick fireplace and spectrograph stylus tie environment to character action and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to inherit and amplify Elise’s silenced work—is signaled early and deepens when Maren discovers the diaries. The tightening occurs not through external opposition but internal crystallization: she chooses voice over passive listening, transforming documentation into dialogue. Cost is felt in generational sacrifice and familial silence. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, with the final utterance narrowing her path irrevocably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: burned diaries, waveform negatives, and resonant stone—not abstract musings. The central question (“What do walls remember?”) is answered non-literally in Maren’s speech joining “collected whispers.” Subtext thrives in what’s unsaid: institutional suppression, maternal protection as erasure. No moralizing; resonance accrues through charged objects and the final echo that “was not quite an echo,” inviting reflection without resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Maren notices harmonics before light, feels architecture “thinking.” Syntax modulates with pressure—longer, lyrical sentences for discovery; short, declarative ones for resolve (“I’m finishing it”). POV remains tightly controlled; no head-hopping, no omniscience. Voice avoids academic register despite technical subject, grounding acoustics in bodily experience (“pressed her palm,” “brittle pages”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ivy-veiled passage breathed back,” “edges blackened to lace.” Every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent (walls as vinyl, memory as resonance). Final paragraph’s rhythm accelerates then stills, mirroring Maren’s shift from listening to speaking. Zero filter-verb stacks; embodiment replaces exposition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms the “haunted archive” trope through acoustic science and climate collapse, making legacy tactile and sonic. The synthesis of grandmother’s occult-seeming research with modern corridor cartography feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (silent university, sentient architecture) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision is singular: memory as physical vibration, inheritance as frequency passed through bone and brick.</comment>
