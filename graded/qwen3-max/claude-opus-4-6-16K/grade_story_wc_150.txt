<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Adaeze’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her “hollowness,” her broken Igbo, her tactile curiosity—all reveal a diasporic self in quiet crisis. Her micro-choices (touching roots, placing the kola nut) stem from contradictory impulses: professional detachment versus ancestral yearning. The final act of speaking to the dibia feels earned, not epiphanic, and carries the cost of vulnerability after decades of spiritual silence. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in gesture and fractured language.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Adaeze doesn’t restore faith but reopens its possibility, with the “first green thread” image crystallizing her stance. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story deepens through patterned discovery (roots, symbols, interrupted journeys) until the final light on the “return” glyph reweights everything. Cost is legible: she remains “half-anointed,” yet chooses presence over perfection. Orientation is immediate and precise; no disorientation penalty applies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint and catalyst. Roots physically hold bones together, dictate excavation limits, and become metaphors made flesh. The sundial’s noon shaft of light is a recurring environmental mechanism that culminates in the closing image. Every sensory detail (cool bark, ghost-shape of water, fruit-light) serves pressure or theme without stalling momentum. The setting earns its 9+ by charging the final image with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconnecting with a fractured heritage—is signaled early and tightens when Adaeze shifts from engineering to ritual engagement. Her agency drives escalation: purposeful wandering replaces grid mapping, rebuilding the sundial becomes devotional. The cost is felt in her admission of being “tired of being half-anointed”—a renunciation of diasporic limbo. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; each discovery deepens her commitment without external antagonism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: interrupted journeys aren’t stated but shown in rerouted roots, unanointed bones, and Adaeze’s own return. The final image—light reading Nsibidi like scripture—offers a non-literal answer: restoration begins not with wholeness but with reaching. No moralizing; resonance accrues through concrete acts (kola nut offering, broken Igbo). Subtext thrives in silence and dappled fruit-light, avoiding binaries or redemption arcs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is singular and controlled: lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature that filters archaeology through ancestral intuition (“reading the tomb the way her grandmother had read the forest”). Syntax modulates with emotional intensity—longer, weaving sentences for discovery; terse fragments for realization (“It was not restoration. Not yet.”). No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained. Diction stays within Adaeze’s hybrid lexicon (technical terms like “load-bearing” blend with poetic imagery), never slipping into academic register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is consistent (roots as fingers, light as a hand) and never muddled. Rhythm varies naturally—paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence, and sentence openings avoid repetition. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; even the opening line (“She did not expect to find fruit”) pays off in the final “fruit-light.” Closure beat is artifact-free and resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesizing diaspora grief, archaeological precision, and Igbo cosmology into a fresh narrative frame. The catacomb orchard—a literal intertwining of life and death—is unforgettable. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over plot causality) heightens thematic stakes without sacrificing clarity. The “interrupted journey” concept is transformed from metaphor to physical reality (roots, bones, language), making the premise feel both specific and mythic. No template echoes; vision is cohesive and bold.</comment>
