<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maret’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her fidgeting, guilt, and pride are rendered through tactile, character-specific actions rather than diagnostic labels. Her final choice (“Neither did you lose”) emerges from seven years of earned endurance, not epiphany. The boy’s brief presence crystallizes their relationship under pressure without overstatement. Flawed but human, her arc avoids safety-hedging while maintaining moral ambiguity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Maret forgives herself not by reversing time but by completing the prince’s move with hard-won wisdom. The causal chain—from teaching the gambit to decoding the tapestry—is tight, with the platinum thread’s position directly enabling resolution. Cost is legible in her trembling hands and the thunder’s delayed release. Orientation is immediate, stakes coherent, and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The frozen village functions as both setting and constraint—the suspended rain, flour cloud, and bark shape Maret’s solitude and urgency. The platinum labyrinth board and frayed tapestry border are micro-settings that actively guide her choices. Final image (rain falling “honest and warm and free”) recharges earlier motifs with emotional and atmospheric payoff. Every detail serves pressure or closure; no white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—undoing her error through patience, not reversal—is signaled early and deepens via the tapestry’s counter-sequence. Escalation occurs through Maret’s agency: her decoding narrows options until only one thread remains. Cost is felt in years of exile and culminates in the warmth of the knight despite stillness. Coincidence never resolves; the thunder’s break is consequence, not convenience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of atonement through patient attention—not correction—emerges organically from chess, weaving, and weather. The final line (“rain fell honest and warm and free”) offers a non-literal answer: redemption lies in acceptance, not control. No moralizing; resonance accrues through precise images (folded coat, frayed threads) that reweight pride as humility. Complexity endures—Edric remains brilliant, Maret still guilty—but cost is integrated, not erased.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is unwaveringly Maret’s, with a perceptual signature attuned to patterns, folds, and silence. Prose rhythm modulates masterfully—from meditative cadence during decoding to sharp clarity at the bell-like board chime. Syntax mirrors her mind: precise, restless, then still. No head-hopping, filter-verb stacks, or register drift; even the prince’s dialogue feels age- and context-appropriate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional: “rain hung suspended in the air like glass beads” establishes texture without overwriting. Sentences vary in length and structure to match emotional tempo; paragraph cuts serve pressure. No paraphrase loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold. Final paragraph’s “honest and warm and free” lands with earned simplicity—zero artifacts dull the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms the “frozen time” trope through chess-as-temporal-magic and weaving-as-decoding, grounded in Maret’s profession and penance. The platinum labyrinth board and tapestry border create a self-consistent logic where pride begets stasis and patience restores flow. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over plot mechanics) heightens thematic stakes without sacrificing clarity. Vision feels singular, not templated.</comment>
