<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nadia’s interiority is concrete, contradictory, and embodied—grief has “weight and texture,” sound has “edges.” Her micro-choices (saving coordinates privately, cracking the geode) reveal a hierarchy of values forged in trauma. Motivation flows directly from her unfiltered awakening after the missile strike, and her final endurance—returning to scheduled work while carrying secret knowledge—constitutes Earned Stasis with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; every insight arises from tactile, sensory experience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the universe’s “unopened geodes” mirror Nadia’s own broken-open survival, reweighting the entire premise with emotional and cosmic resonance. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pressure builds via data anomalies, memory shards, and the ticking clock, culminating in a Charged Poise where nothing changes externally but everything shifts internally. Cost is legible in the final image: she pockets the coordinates, touches the geode, and resumes duty—foreclosing institutional trust, bearing solitary knowledge. Orientation is immediate and vivid by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating observatory isn’t backdrop—it’s a pressure chamber: tethered, isolated, above the war that killed her husband, below the indifferent cosmos. The geode functions as micro-setting, constraining choice (she hides discoveries from institutions that “send a missile”) and charging the final image when she touches its “cold, sharp, real” crystals. Sensory detail is selective and urgent: emergency lighting on amethyst, the hum of rebooting systems, the silence of the courtyard mid-music. Every detail serves theme, character, or constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding “unused potential”—is signaled early and deepens through Nadia’s hunt during the 40-minute window. The tightening occurs when she discovers the Cygnus anomaly, forcing a trade-off: report it (risk weaponization) or claim it (bear isolation). Agency is clear: she saves to her private drive, a renunciation of institutional complicity. Cost is unmistakable: “the courtyard is still rubble… Yusef is still dead,” yet she endures, warping reality around her like dark matter. Escalation is driven by her perturbation models, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the collision of personal grief and cosmic inquiry: unused potential pools in both shattered lives and silent regions of space. The geode—a literal and metaphorical vessel—shifts meaning from wedding relic to symbol of hidden abundance, culminating in the realization that “a survivor is a pool of unused potential.” No moralizing; the final image reweights everything: discovery doesn’t heal, but it affirms kinship between human and cosmic silence. Subtext thrives in gesture—pocketing coordinates, touching crystal—and avoids abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose carries a distinct perceptual signature: Nadia notices physics as bodies, equations as names, distance as something you “bruise yourself against.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—short, sharp clauses during the hunt; lyrical cadence in reflection. Voice remains consistent, grounded in her trauma and profession, never slipping into academic jargon despite technical content. Free indirect style blends seamlessly with embodied thought (“She is it”), and the single POV is unwavering, immersive, and psychologically precise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is taut, vivid, and purposeful. Sentences vary in length and structure to match emotional valence; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is precise (“crystals like frozen light, like compressed patience”) and never muddled. High information density: “grief had weight and texture, but you could never set it down” conveys embodiment, permanence, and helplessness in one breath. Final line crystallizes the entire arc without overstatement. Minor deduction only for slight density in the perturbation theory explanation, though it serves character.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality lies in fusing astrophysics with intimate grief through the lens of “unfiltered awakening”—a fresh take on trauma-as-perception-shift. The floating observatory, geode, and perturbation hunt cohere into a singular vision where scientific method becomes elegy. Risk-taking (lyric science fiction in literary mode) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight: only someone broken open could detect the universe’s hidden pools. No derivative tropes; every element is transformed by specificity and emotional truth.</comment>
