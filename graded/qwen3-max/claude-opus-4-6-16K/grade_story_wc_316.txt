<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is rendered with precise, embodied numbness (“hands that felt like they belonged to someone else”) and evolves through tactile combat rather than diagnostic labels. Her contradictory state—foundation without feeling—clashes credibly with Kael-2’s emotional excess, and their micro-choices in sparring reveal a hierarchy of values (structure vs. affect) with visible cost. The final tear is earned not by declaration but by accumulated voltage from blows. No therapy-speak; emotional progression feels irrational yet coherent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: two women reconstitute wholeness through Earned Stasis (renouncing custody) and Charged Poise (standing at the edge, feeling wind). Cost is legible in buried brain and shared daughter. Orientation anchors instantly (“floating rock dojo… Kael climbed…”), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via sensory layering and historical strata collapsing around them. Final image reweights “original/copy” into irrelevance with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo isn’t backdrop—it constrains tactics (rope ladder ascent, exposed platform) and charges closure (wind felt only after integration). Basalt channels weeping mineral water mirror Kael’s emotional drought; history rewriting itself in real time tightens decisions by destabilizing ground beneath them. Sensory detail is selective (cold wind, sloshing gel) and filtered through Kael’s dissociated POV. Final wind vivifies because setting has been a crucible, not a postcard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—custody of self/life—is signaled early and deepens when sparring becomes mutual teaching. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each counterattack transfers feeling or stillness, narrowing options until renunciation is inevitable. Cost is unmistakable—Kael regains sensation only by accepting shared motherhood; Kael-2 surrenders sole claim to gain calm. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: emotional density intensifies with every strike.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: ego death, cloning, and custody battle synthesize into a non-literal answer about wholeness requiring contradiction. Subtext lives in gesture (burying the brain) and silence (tears without words). Final image—wind as indifferent yet vivifying—rejects binary happiness/sorrow for undeniably real presence. No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete struggle, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature (“geometry of the situation,” “watercolor of a woman”). Voice modulates under pressure: early flatness gives way to rhythmic intensity during sparring (“screaming, weeping, laughing mid-strike”), then calm cadence at dawn. Syntax mirrors dissociation (short, exact clauses) then integration (longer breaths). No head-hopping; Kael-2’s dialogue carries warm certainty distinct from Kael’s precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “basalt carved with training channels that wept mineral water into the void” does setting, tone, and theme in one. Figurative language is pattern-taught (water/color motifs) and payoff-earned (tears as return of feeling). Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “dinosaur bones surfacing and dissolving”—one beat where imagery risks muddle, though closure remains clear. Zero loops; every sentence advances multiple layers.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise transforms cloning tropes via specific emotional logic: numbness vs. excess as complementary halves. Floating dojo in tectonic memory space feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Risk-taking (two mothers, no original) heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity. Final reconfiguration—burying the brain while history rewrites—synthesizes science, grief, and identity with irreplaceable specificity. Bold yet fully committed.</comment>
