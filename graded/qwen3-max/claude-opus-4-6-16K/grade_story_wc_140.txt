<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motivation—rooted in sensory memory and existential erasure—is rendered with visceral specificity, not abstraction. Her micro-choices (e.g., writing in third person, staying among the dead) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over recognition, texture over identity. Internal conflict is embodied in her tactile hunger for others’ memories to verify her own past, avoiding therapy-speak. The final act of self-documentation as anonymous witness feels earned, costly, and consistent with her perceptual filter.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Structure follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, taught by the second paragraph and held through closure. The inciting error is cleanly anchored by word 12; disorientation serves thematic resonance, not confusion. Closure is a Charged Poise: she writes her own fragment, accepts namelessness, and listens as the tide carries secrets away—reconfiguring presence into something deeper than official existence. Cost is legible in the line: “She had no name the world would recognize.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The container yard functions as both setting and micro-setting: its shifting corridors constrain movement, high tide grants solitude, rust and salt shape perception. The environment actively enables her survival and eavesdropping tactics. Final image—steel, salt, murmuring cargo—charges the closure by embodying her chosen ontology. Every detail (bleeding rust, ankle-deep flood, cranes too loud to hear weeping) is filtered through her sensory bias, never generic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—verifying the reality of memory without external validation—is signaled early and deepens through her notebook practice. The meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from collecting others’ fragments to writing her own, accepting erasure as a form of presence. Agency is quiet but decisive: choosing not to correct the death certificate, then choosing to document herself anonymously. Cost is felt in the loss of all social anchors, yet reconfigured as freedom in the labyrinth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of bureaucracy, memory, and listening—never stated. The central question (“Is a history that no one can corroborate still real?”) is answered non-literally in the final image: she is more present among the dead because she attends to unrecorded lives. Subtext thrives in silence, rust, and overheard confessions. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether this is liberation or surrender, enriched by the engineer’s poison label and Aram’s hidden grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>POV is single, intimate, and consistently filtered through a synesthetic perception (“texture” of lies, “grain” of confessions). Voice modulates with emotional intensity—spare during morgue awakening, lyrical in container-yard descriptions, restrained in notebook entries. Syntax mirrors her state: fragmented during disorientation, fluid during listening. No head-hopping; even overheard stories are rendered through her selective, embodied attention. Prose itself becomes a tool of verification, matching her method.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and purposeful—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Opening line (“They declared her dead on a Tuesday”) anchors voice and stakes instantly. Figurative language (“metal cathedral,” “murmuring cargo”) is precise, never purple. No loops or scaffold; even reflective passages are tethered to present stimuli (e.g., tide levels cue memory work). Final paragraph’s cadence—short, tidal sentences—mirrors retreat and resolution without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms bureaucratic erasure into a lyrical meditation on unofficial existence. The premise avoids cliché by grounding ghostliness in sensory epistemology, not supernaturalism. Every element—tides, containers, poison labels—feels irreplaceable and coheres into a singular vision. Bold risk: making passive observation active witnessing, and closure not about reclaiming identity but embracing nameless presence. Fresh synthesis of surveillance capitalism, maritime liminality, and archival longing feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
