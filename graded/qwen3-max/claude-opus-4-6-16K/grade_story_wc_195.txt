<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aldric’s internal conflict—between hollowed withdrawal and reawakened ritual embodiment—is rendered with visceral specificity. His trembling hands, armor removal as “walls coming down,” and the terror/radiance of his bare face reveal contradictory impulses in real time. The final vow emerges not as epiphany but as rediscovered muscle memory, earned by prior causality. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied through motion, breath, and tactile interaction with the program and soil.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Aldric’s surrender reconfigures possibility itself, with visible cost—the shedding of armor as social and psychological skin. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern density (ritual → puppet → body) intensifies until the final spiral-prayer crystallizes meaning. Reality shifts *because* he moves, not coincidentally. Cost is legible in “walls coming down” and the “terrified and radiant” exposure of his face.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The alchemical greenhouse functions as both setting and micro-setting: lead pipes, breathing soil, and luminous fruit directly constrain and enable action. The endless night fracturing into “raw material of dawn” charges the final image. Sensory detail (scent of metals, silver filament roots) is filtered through Aldric’s knightly perception—no tourist catalog. Environment actively responds to his ritual, making it indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming agency through forgotten ritual—is signaled early and deepens when the program reveals encoded choreography. The tightening occurs when Aldric recognizes the patterns in his own body, forcing a choice: remain hollowed or surrender anew. Agency drives escalation: his unsnapping of armor pieces narrows options irreversibly. Cost is felt in vulnerability (“terrified” face) and the irreversible return to the world.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme—allegiance to unrealized potential—emerges through concrete particulars: puppet strings vs. embodied patterns, mercury pears vs. human breath. The ending offers a non-literal answer: possibility is shaped not by holding but by motion and surrender. No moralizing; resonance accrues via the program’s diagrams becoming living prayer. Complexity is preserved—Aldric serves “the thing that might become,” not a guaranteed redemption.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Aldric notices ritual geometry, armor weight, and botanical anomalies through a knight-alchemist’s lens. Rhythm modulates masterfully—from measured description to breathless cadence during disrobing. Syntax mirrors internal state: fragmented clauses during trembling, flowing spirals during prayer. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored in Aldric’s sensorium with consistent psychic distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “soil breathed,” “constellations rearranged into alphabets no one could read.” Figurative language is coherent (armor as “walls,” night as “raw material”). Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final paragraph’s “crystalline, trembling, blissful” triad earns its lyricism through accumulated pressure. Minor deduction for slight overuse of em-dashes in middle section.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms chivalric tropes via alchemical botany and puppet-theater ritual. The “factually mystical” premise is fully committed to, with internal logic (lead pipes → silver roots) that feels discovered, not imposed. Risk-taking—silent protagonist, abstract stakes—heightens emotional truth. The synthesis of knightly oath and marionette choreography feels inevitable in hindsight, with irreplaceable specificity (e.g., “Third Surrender” diagram).</comment>
