<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Siv’s motivation—preserving erased names through craft—is rooted in a specific, embodied failure and deepened by her self-forgiveness as thaw, not absolution. Her internal conflict (grief vs. creation) manifests simultaneously in tactile choices: gentle hands reconfiguring rope, bronze dust on palms, breath in cold air. The final whisper of a name is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of eleven years’ silence. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through wax, ice, and braid.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the sanctum illuminates from within, projecting names as light, crystallizing Siv’s shift from erasure to transmission. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through sensory braiding of aurora, rope, card, and memory—and cost is legible in the “stone in her sternum” now replaced by “snowmelt ardor.” Every beat tightens around the dominant stake: making transcribed memory permanent. Orientation is immediate and vivid (“glacier stairs,” “blue darkness”), with no disorientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains and enables: aurora refracts through ancient ice veins, the rope’s stiffness resists then yields, cold shapes Siv’s patience. The micro-setting (rope, card, hands) functions as environment, charging the final image when braids split green light into spectral names. Sensory detail is selective, profession-filtered (wax caster notices filament fragility), and never stalls momentum. The sanctum’s transformation—from silent tomb to luminous archive—is inseparable from closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving sonic memory of lost names) is signaled early and escalates through Siv’s agency: she chooses to descend, to reconfigure, to witness. The meaningful deepening occurs when the rope’s new pattern triggers illumination—a turn driven by her precise, gentle labor, not coincidence. Cost is felt: eleven years of silence, the risk of failing again, the weight of carrying what the world forgot. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, intensifying through cadence and density, not external opposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the paradox of lost-wax casting: permanence born from destruction. The ending offers a non-literal answer—names projected as light—to the central question of how to hold what disappears. Subtext operates in silence, braid, and aurora; no moralizing. The final image reweights the entire premise: grief, once stone, becomes current; erasure becomes transmission. Complexity is preserved—forgiveness isn’t triumph but thaw, enabling flow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is single, stable, and deeply interiorized through a distinct perceptual signature: a caster’s attention to pressure, filament, hollow. Voice modulates with emotional intensity—lyric in reflection (“grief… becomes its own kind of erasure”), precise in action (“strand over strand”). Syntax mirrors thought: fluid in memory, taut in labor. No head-hopping, no register drift; diction stays within Siv’s lexicon (bronze, wax, braid). The prose itself embodies the story’s method: building beauty by first shaping what must be burned away.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, varied, and propulsive—each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is coherent (grief as stone, forgiveness as thaw, memory as moth wing) and peaks without muddle. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; rhythm shifts naturally between reflection and action. The final line (“bell that had been waiting… to be struck”) resonates without overstatement. High information density: “technically gentle” conveys decades of training in two words. Closure image is sharp, unblurred by artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Originality lies in the synthesis: linguistic preservation via street organ punch cards, translated into ceremonial rope braids, activated by aurora in glacial ice. The core concept—transcribed memory as fragile yet castable—feels fresh, specific, and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over plot) heightens stakes by making silence palpable. No tropes recycled; every detail (Kanallat dialect, lost-wax method, braid syntax) serves character and conflict. Vision is singular, cohesive, and un-hedged.</comment>
