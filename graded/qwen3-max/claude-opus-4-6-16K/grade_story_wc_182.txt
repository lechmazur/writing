<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—rooted in her linguistic expertise and obsession with gaps—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies under pressure. Her micro-choices (rationing oil, using thread) reveal a hierarchy of values, and her final act of opening the book is earned by prior causality. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are conveyed through tactile, profession-specific perception (“silences between words,” “erased marginalia”). The only slight slip: Maren’s interiority remains thin, but as secondary pressure, his role functions without undermining Elara’s arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the Library isn’t hidden but guarded until seekers learn to listen, reweighting the entire premise. Cost is legible in Elara’s eleven years of labor and the scholars’ gauntness, crystallized in the final image where “the mountain sang.” Orientation anchors instantly (“The mountain had no summit. It had shelves”), and the Causal lens holds—each beat follows because/therefore logic (diary → code → phonetic negotiation). No causality breaks; the temporal fissure is established as part of the mountain’s rules.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore constrains every choice: staircases spiral into darkness, dead ends waste time, corridors respond to sound. Setting charges the final image—the humming books vibrate with forgotten wisdom, making the mountain an active participant. Sensory detail is purposeful (ozone smell, water-stained diary, edible mosses) and filtered through Elara’s professional bias (noticing acoustic properties over visual grandeur). The “shelves” metaphor evolves from structural oddity to literal instrument, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—accessing the Library of Unlearned Lessons—is signaled early and tightens when Maren arrives with trapped scholars, raising urgency. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she decodes the diary, speaks Late Meridian, and renegotiates with the mountain. Cost is unmistakable: eleven years of mapping, rationed resources, and the physical/emotional toll on the rescued scholars. The mountain’s sentience complicates but doesn’t resolve; success stems from Elara’s skill, not luck.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: wisdom requires listening, not just seeking. The final image—Elara opening the book as “the mountain sang”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting all prior effort as preparation for attunement. Subtext operates through silence (gaps, missing pages) and sound (resonance, symphony), avoiding moralizing. Complexity is embraced: the Library isn’t salvific but conditional, and humanity’s refusal to learn remains unresolved, preserving ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled single-third, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices linguistic and acoustic textures first (“Late Meridian,” “echo patterns”). Voice modulates under pressure—prose tightens during ascent (“Walls parted. Stairs unfolded”) without losing lyrical precision. No head-hopping; Maren’s dialogue carries idiosyncratic urgency (“People are trapped”) without convergence. The opening line (“The mountain had no summit. It had shelves”) instantly establishes voice and stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “corridors of stone and paper,” “grammar that could only be parsed by speakers who understood the intent behind each syllable.” Figurative language is coherent (mountain as instrument, knowledge as geology) and peaks cleanly. Minor deduction: one slight redundancy in describing the diary (“leather-bound, water-stained” followed by “pressed flowers and dense annotations”), but no loops or scaffold dull closure. Final line (“the mountain sang”) resonates without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise transforms tropes (labyrinth, lost library) through specific synthesis: the mountain is a sentient instrument, rescue hinges on linguistic acoustics, and wisdom is conditional on listening. Emotional truth grounds ingenuity—Elara’s obsession feels lived, not conceptual. Risk-taking (time traveler, botanical code) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core idea—that unlearned lessons are gaps in collective memory—feels inevitable in hindsight and irreplaceable.</comment>
