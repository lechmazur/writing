<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sable’s micro-choices—kneeling, climbing, placing the fruit—reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in communal care and embodied grief. The ghost’s motivation is dramatized through orchestration, not declaration, and its “strangely trustworthy” nature emerges via consistent action, not label. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; emotion lives in tactile details like warm chalk and ringing copper. The final renunciation—accepting that the living must now tend the garden—is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of the Gardener’s departure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “YOU WERE ALWAYS THE GARDEN” reweights the entire premise from external salvation to collective agency, with the cost being the ghost’s necessary withdrawal. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each chalk message deepens density and tightens communal interdependence—culminating in a resonant final image where the watering bell rings unaided. Orientation is immediate (“orchard planet of Verath”), stakes cohere (“the threat of loss cuts communal”), and every beat links to the next through patterned cause (message → action → discovery). The cost is legible in the empty sidewalk where the fruit vanishes—a quiet forfeiture of dependency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The floating rock arches are not backdrop but active resource: they weep mineral water that revives fungal networks, directly enabling the plot’s turn. The butterfly watering bell functions as micro-setting—it constrains Sable’s initial collection method and later becomes the colony’s auditory signal. Sensory detail is purposeful: luminous chalk, violet nebula light, ringing drops—all filtered through settlers’ desperate hope. The final image of green orchards beneath a violet sky ties environment to emotional resolution, making setting inseparable from theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—communal survival—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency: Sable climbs, Petro analyzes, Jun engineers, all catalyzed by the Gardener’s prompts. The tightening occurs when the ghost reveals its true aim isn’t to fix but to connect, forcing settlers to trust each other. Cost is visible: the ghost’s labor, the settlers’ vulnerability in acting on faith, and ultimately the ghost’s departure once its work is done. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with each chalk message deepening interdependence rather than resolving externally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the watering bell, chalk messages, and mineral rain accrue meaning until the final line reconfigures everything—salvation was never external but collective. Subtext thrives in silence (the untouched fruit, the self-ringing bell) and gesture (fingers pressing warm chalk). The story resists moralizing; instead, it offers a resonant, non-literal answer: community is the garden. Ambiguity lingers (Is the Gardener real? Does the bell ring by wind or spirit?), but the emotional truth—trust as cultivation—is undeniable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, focalized through the collective “they” that gradually centers Sable without head-hopping. Voice is distinct: lyrical but precise, with rhythmic control that modulates from elegiac (“soil exhaled dust”) to urgent (“LOOK UP”) to transcendent (“YOU WERE ALWAYS THE GARDEN”). Diction stays within the settlers’ lexicon—no academic intrusions—and syntax varies purposefully, especially in high-pressure beats (short clauses for action, flowing sentences for revelation). The perceptual signature—attuned to light, sound, and texture—remains consistent and character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is controlled (“floating rock arches bridged the sky like the ribs of some slumbering god”) and never muddled. No loops or scaffold; information density is high (e.g., “fungi pulsed back to life” conveys biology and hope in five words). Final lines resonate without overwriting: the bell rings, the arches weep, the sky looks like a nebula—concrete images that reweight earlier motifs. Minor deduction only for one slightly ornate phrase (“thorny and imperfect, yes, brambled with the memory…”), but it serves tone without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms the “helpful ghost” trope through specificity: the Gardener’s altruism is tactical, not magical, and tied to communal epistemology. The orchard planet with floating arches feels fresh because its physics directly enable the solution (mineral rain). Emotional truth anchors ingenuity—the settlers’ grief-turned-kinship is rendered with brambled hope, not sentimentality. The risk of a lyric, accumulative structure pays off in a closure that feels both inevitable and wondrous, with no gimmickry. Originality lies in making collective action the miracle.</comment>
