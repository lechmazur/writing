<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “brightly attentive” perception feels tactile and specific, not diagnostic. Her motivation (“to find where deleted files go”) fuels credible, escalating choices with visible cost: confronting Harke, copying data, sending the leak. The final act of whistleblowing reads as earned endurance (Earned Stasis), foreclosing safety with palpable stakes. Minor deduction: internal contradiction could be sharper in her hesitation before acting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the 7-22 pattern shifts from eerie noise to a count of the disappeared, reweighting the archive’s silence into testimony. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via recurring numbers, unsent messages, and the patch—culminating in a charged final image where ghosts “draw breath.” Cost is legible: Lena sacrifices security for truth. Orientation anchors firmly by line 30; causality remains tight under the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The archive functions as micro-setting: its hum, partitions, and metadata constrain Lena’s actions and charge the ending. Sensory detail (“hummed in frequencies,” “texture of data”) filters through her professional bias, avoiding white-room syndrome. The singed Artemis-7 patch recurs with evolving weight, directly shaping closure. Deduction: broader Chicago HQ setting remains underutilized, but the server complex suffices as active crucible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus corporate erasure—is signaled early and tightens when Harke lies, forcing Lena’s renunciation of institutional trust. Escalation is driven by her agency: each discovery (hidden partition, unsent messages) narrows options until whistleblowing becomes inevitable. Cost is unmistakable: she risks career and safety. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens with one decisive deepening (the patch revelation).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: data as memory, silence as complicity. The final image—forty-three ghosts drawing breath—offers resonant, non-literal answer to “where deleted files go,” reweighting digital erasure as moral failure. Avoids moralizing; complexity lingers in Meridian’s secrecy versus Lena’s defiance. Recurring numbers and patch accrue subtext without overt symbolism, earning wisdom through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is flawlessly controlled: first-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature (“feel the texture of data like a jeweler”). Voice modulates under pressure—syntax tightens during discoveries, lyrical in reflection—without register drift. No head-hopping; diction stays within Lena’s lexicon. Final line’s rhythm (“forty-three ghosts had drawn breath”) crystallizes tone and stakes with poetic precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language (“furniture in an abandoned house,” “last breath caught in glass”) is purposeful, not overwritten. Zero paraphrase loops; syntactic variety supports momentum. Minor deduction: one slightly stacked modifier (“brightly attentive in her work”) but no artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis: merges digital archiving, missing persons, and corporate sci-fi into a fresh, inevitable whole. Tropes (whistleblower, hidden data) are grounded in Lena’s specific expertise and moral calculus. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The 7-22 motif’s transformation from pattern to count feels both surprising and rigorously earned.</comment>
