<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marco’s interiority is concrete, specific, and consistent—his observational compulsion and ghost-seeing are embodied through micro-choices (e.g., analyzing dust patterns, choosing to engage). His final act of pocketing the locket reveals a hierarchy of values: duty to the unseen over bureaucratic compliance. The ghost’s silent presence functions as a crucible that forces his only meaningful choice, with visible cost (emotional burden, future obligation). No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile perception and professional habit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Marco accepts ongoing responsibility, foreclosing detachment. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory detail and pattern (ceiling cracks → dust → barrel → locket), culminating in a cadence shift when the fluorescents die. Cost is legible: “He pocketed the locket… and he would look.” Orientation is immediate and precise. Every beat links through Marco’s attention, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office isn’t backdrop—it’s active micro-setting. Ceilings “collect every secret,” guiding Marco’s search; warped floorboards and buzzing fluorescents pressure mood and movement. The mainspring barrel hidden in the ceiling directly emerges from this environment. Final image—plaster holding “secrets lighter now by one”—charges closure. Sensory detail (dust, cold air, sequins catching phantom light) is filtered through Marco’s professional bias, never touristy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—completing the elevator job—is deepened by the discovery of the barrel, which reframes Marco’s role from technician to witness. The meaningful tightening occurs when he chooses to engage the ghost, narrowing his path from mechanical repair to moral obligation. Cost is felt: he assumes an open-ended quest. Agency is clear, though escalation leans slightly more on revelation than active complication; still, pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme—what we choose not to see, and who bears the weight of unfinished things—emerges through concrete particulars: cracked plaster, hidden locket, watching ghosts. No moralizing; resonance accrues via the recurring image of ceilings as truth-tellers. Final reconfiguration reweights the premise: repair isn’t just structural but ethical. The ghost’s release isn’t salvation but completion, and Marco’s quiet resolve carries thematic weight without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Marco notices ceilings first, reads dust like text, thinks in horological terms. Voice modulates with pressure—shorter sentences during discovery, lyrical restraint at closure. POV is tightly controlled; no head-hopping, no omniscience. Syntax mirrors obsession: precise, cumulative, yet fluid. The prose breathes like a craftsman’s measured rhythm, never slipping into exposition or filter-verb stacks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High information density: “ceilings collected every secret a structure wanted to forget” does setting, character, and theme in one. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary naturally. Figurative language is sparse but potent (“ghost flickered like a bulb about to die”). Final paragraph’s cadence—“plaster held its silence, its secrets lighter now by one”—resonates without overwriting. Read-aloud rhythm is impeccable, with paragraph cuts that sharpen emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ghost story fused with occupational realism, where haunting is solved not by exorcism but archival attention. Elevator repair + horology + circus decay creates a uniquely grounded uncanny. The “weightless burden” concept avoids cliché by tying metaphysics to physical detail (dust patterns, brass engravings). Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off—no spectacle, just earned stasis. Feels inevitable in hindsight, yet wholly original in execution.</comment>
