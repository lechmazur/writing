<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sable’s motivation—grafting herself into community through patient alignment—is embodied in her craft, micro-choices (e.g., recognizing Cael’s technique), and emotional restraint. Ren’s “boldly sympathetic” trait drives tangible action (offering the search) with social cost (others find his tenderness excessive). The trio’s final hand-pressing crystallizes contradictory impulses: longing vs. belonging, solitude vs. kinship. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; grief is held “like a nest holds an egg”—concrete, character-specific, and earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the arbor carving reconfigures belonging as active grafting, not passive absorption. Cost is legible—Sable’s years of solitude, Ren’s social friction, Cael’s decades of waiting—all crystallized in the shared palm press. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: prismatic light, glyphs, and hummed songs accrue meaning until the final image reweights silence as communion. Orientation is clear by line 30; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard isn’t backdrop—it constrains choice (residents’ caution, fragile trees) and charges closure (crater light refracts through branches onto the arbor during the carving). The obsidian arbor functions as micro-setting: its volcanic glass surface demands precise knife-work, linking Sable’s marsh-reed skill to the act of belonging. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: early focus on visual prisms gives way to tactile warmth on cold glass at climax. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography (outer rows → arbor center) tracks cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—belonging as grafting, not force—is signaled early and deepens when the shared search reveals Cael’s diaspora call. Protagonist agency drives escalation: Sable’s recognition of marsh-work technique narrows the search, leading to the decisive reunion. Cost is unmistakable: Sable’s vulnerability in weeping, Ren’s social risk in allying with a stranger, Cael’s lifelong wait. Coincidence (finding Cael) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the elders’ conditional offer requires earned proof via the search.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: grief shaped like nests, belonging as cambium layers fusing. The final image—three hands on obsidian—answers the central question non-literally: home is reconstructed through shared labor, not rediscovered. Avoids moralizing; “lost languages” feel near not through words but prismatic light and hummed songs. Subtext thrives in silence: the uncarved names before Sable’s arrival speak louder than exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Sable’s sculptor’s perception (“light passed through... aching and beautiful”). Voice modulates with pressure: lyrical cadence in description tightens to short clauses during the glyph search (“They talked as they searched”). Distinct perceptual signature—marsh-reed textures, light refraction—grounds every observation. No head-hopping; Ren’s dialogue carries his bold sympathy without voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “sap flows as one” does thematic, biological, and emotional work. Figurative language is pattern-taught (prisms, grafting) and payoff-earned (crater light fractures into rainbows at closure). Minor overwriting in “luminescent ache shift from longing into something warmer”—slightly abstract for peak beat—but immediately grounded by tactile palm press. Zero loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary (“Sable had come,” “The orchard existed,” “It was Ren”).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms “found family” trope through specific ecology: crystal trees fruiting stones, marsh-reed stylus on bark, obsidian arbor as communal ledger. The synthesis—diaspora grief expressed through craft-based belonging—feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk: replacing dialogue with hummed songs and glyphs, yet clarity remains. No derivative echoes; “webs of kinship” is made visceral through cautious residents and tightened silences.</comment>
