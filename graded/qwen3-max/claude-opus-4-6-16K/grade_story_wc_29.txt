<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is precise, embodied (“coffee-stained fingers,” “blood go cold”), and her contradictions—hope versus dread, duty versus isolation—are active in scene. Her micro-choices (bribing the guard, reflecting the signal) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: ostracism for truth. The final renunciation—enduring hatred to prevent catastrophe—is earned by prior causality and flaw (her solitary rigor). No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile detail and consequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the sky’s “cautiously hopeful emptiness” reweights the premise from cosmic salvation to human fragility, with undeniable social cost (Maren’s exile). The Causal lens holds: each beat follows because/therefore logic (detect lie → interfere → silence → backlash). The decisive act—transmitting back—narrows options irreversibly. Cost is legible in the final image: formulas degrade, trust evaporates, but survival is secured.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The university radio station functions as micro-setting: its analog board enables detection, its isolation permits sabotage, and its coffee/ionized dust atmosphere mirrors Maren’s weary vigilance. The astronomical charts are handled repeatedly and reweighted at closure (from tool to relic of averted doom). However, the setting doesn’t *constrain* the final choice beyond enabling it—thus missing the 9+ gate requiring environmental pressure on the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—humanity’s survival against seductive deception—is signaled early and tightens when Maren discovers the harmonic ghost. Her interference is a high-agency deepening that forecloses both institutional control and naive disclosure, forcing a third path. The cost is immediate and visible: universal blame, withdrawal of gifts, and irreversible loss of trust. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens with no coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the peril of unexamined generosity and the loneliness of foresight. Subtext operates through silence, betrayal, and the degrading formulas—never stated. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: salvation requires rejecting false gifts, even at the price of being hated. Complexity is preserved—both factions are wrong, the tricksters are cunning, and Maren’s victory is bitter, not triumphant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled single-third, with a perceptual signature steeped in scientific precision and sensory unease (“vibrations felt in the chest”). Syntax modulates under pressure: longer, analytical sentences early; terse, rhythmic phrasing during transmission (“Fourteen seconds”). Voice remains consistent, idiosyncratic, and free of head-hopping or register drift. The prose embodies Maren’s mind without filter-verb stacks or exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense, varied, and propulsive. Opening line (“smelled like burnt coffee and ionized dust”) anchors voice and stakes instantly. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse but potent (“seam in the deception,” “strings” of manipulation). Final line crystallizes the theme without overwriting. Minor deduction for one slightly ornate phrase (“cosmic tricksters” borders on label), but no artifacts dull the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms the “alien contact” trope through grounded scientific rigor and moral ambiguity. The subsonic deception mechanism feels fresh, specific, and integral—not gimmickry. Emotional truth outweighs spectacle: the real conflict is human gullibility versus lonely vigilance. Risk-taking (quiet climax, unsympathetic factions, bittersweet closure) heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity. The synthesis of astrophysics, institutional politics, and ethical sacrifice feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
