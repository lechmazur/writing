<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—salvaging purity from wreckage—is embodied in her trance work and micro-choices, especially her refusal to accuse but instead weave truth through dream-images. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest via tactile details (e.g., candlelight dipping “as if holding their breath”). The boy’s final smile and release feel earned because Elara’s method aligns with her flaw: indirect confrontation that risks failure. Cost is felt in the melted globe’s transformation from prison to memorial.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara endures the weight of truth without direct confrontation, foreclosing vengeance for witness. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds via recurring dream cameos until the fabricated scene collapses under projected evidence. Cost is legible in the shrine’s restored stillness and the globe’s reweighted meaning. Orientation anchors immediately (“heart of the great ice,” “Elara”), and causality holds through psychic choreography.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glacier shrine functions as micro-setting: its weeping walls and candlelight constrain Elara’s ritual and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective (blue cold, slumped glass) and filtered through her wreck-diver POV. The snow globe’s physical state evolves with the plot, culminating in its handling as memorial. Environment directly enables the climax—dream-ocean solidifies into the research outpost where heat shattered the original globe.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing the boy’s spirit—is signaled early and tightens when the man’s interference emerges. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she deepens trance to construct a shared dreamscape, risking psychic exposure. Cost is visible in the candle flames dimming and the emotional toll of confronting manufactured lies. The man’s dissolution and the boy’s release reconfigure options irreversibly, though the story slightly softens consequence by resolving cleanly without lingering trauma.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme—truth as salvageable purity amid frozen lies—emerges through the snow globe’s transformation and Elara’s indirect justice. Subtext thrives in silence: the boy never speaks, the man’s excuses unravel via others’ dreams. Final image reweights the premise: broken objects can memorialize truth without repair. Avoids moralizing; resonance stems from concrete particulars (melted plastic, borrowed starlight) rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled single-third with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices ice-polish, candle-dip, dream-textures. Voice modulates under pressure—syntax shortens during trance deepening (“The air grows heavy…”). No head-hopping; even dream projections remain filtered through her weaving. Diction stays within her lexicon (“breath-hollowed,” “psychic theater”) without register drift or filter-verb stacks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “walls weep history,” “human eclipse” avoid cliché. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light/starlight motifs) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in “shimmering ocean” beat slightly slows momentum, but no loops or scaffold. Final line (“borrowed starlight… feels like her own”) crystallizes theme without redundancy. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise transforms ghost-whisperer trope via frozen archive and dream-cameo mechanics. Specificity abounds: plastic skier suspended mid-fall, control panel heat source, banker/pilot dream cameos. Risk-taking (non-confrontational resolution) heightens stakes by relying on accumulated evidence rather than showdown. Vision coheres—every element serves the core question: can truth be salvaged without violence? Feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmicky.</comment>
