<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is precise and embodied—his grief manifests in micro-choices like comparing gestures across decades, not abstract longing. His contradiction (love vs. helplessness) drives every action without therapy-speak. The river stone anchors his motivation physically, and his final integration choice accepts Elara’s trauma as inseparable from her hope. His emotional arc culminates in Earned Stasis: enduring regret made luminous by purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s archive reconstitutes not by erasure but integration, shifting light-vines to “silvery blue”—a visual CR of hope’s cost. The causal lens holds: Kael’s method (video comparison) reveals the shadow’s origin, which directly enables his integration tactic. Cost is legible in the final image—regret as “permanent resident” yet “luminous.” Orientation anchors instantly: “Lumina-Arbor,” “Kael,” “Elara,” “clouds.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The blooming library isn’t backdrop—it’s an active micro-setting: light-vines wilt with corruption, consoles require physical conduits (river stone), and cloud-sea twilight mirrors emotional cadence. Sensory hierarchy prioritizes tactile (stone’s coolness) and visual (spectral vines) under pressure. Final image (“last sliver of sun below cloud-sea”) charges closure by echoing Kael’s dusk-noticing trait. Only minor deduction: “pearl console” lacks functional constraint beyond aesthetics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (“preserve shape of hope”) tightens decisively when Kael realizes deletion would erase Elara’s humanity—forcing integration over excision. Agency drives escalation: his video analysis *creates* the insight that the shadow is self-caged trauma, altering tactics. Cost is felt in the “frost-tinged dawn” revival—hope preserved but irrevocably altered. Coincidence never resolves; all pressure stems from Kael’s choices under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the river stone’s warmth post-integration embodies “love strong enough to hold a soul together.” Subtext thrives in gesture discordance (inward-curled fingers vs. open university laughter). Final image reweights the premise—hope isn’t pristine but “luminous regret”—without moralizing. Avoids binaries: trauma isn’t conquered but woven into resilience, making Elara’s memory “fragile, real, heartbreakingly beautiful.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: Kael notices “dusk in her memory before night arrived,” filtering all description through curator’s precision. Syntax modulates under pressure—shorter clauses during analysis (“He muted the hum... focusing”), lyrical flow in resolution. No head-hopping; single POV maintains strict knowledge bounds (e.g., inferring Elara’s fear from gestures, not omniscience). Only flaw: slight register lift in “cognitive tapestry” risks academic drift, but immediately grounded by “river stone” tactility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: “light-vines strangling a perfect rose” merges setting and conflict in one image. Sentence openings vary (“He sat...”, “For weeks...”, “His approach...”), avoiding template cadence. Minor overwriting in “spectral light-vines that held her essence”—“spectral” slightly redundant after “blooming library above clouds.” No loops or artifacts; every line advances character or atmosphere. Final paragraph’s “luminous regret” crystallizes tone without summary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise transforms digital-afterlife tropes via specific mechanics: trauma as autonomous “shadow” in shareable dreams, cured not by deletion but contextual reintegration. Emotional truth anchors ingenuity—Kael’s method (comparing silent videos) feels freshly human in a tech-fantasy space. Risk-taking pays off: the “silvery blue” revival rejects easy optimism, committing to hope’s cost. No derivative echoes; voice, concept, and closure cohere as singular vision.</comment>
