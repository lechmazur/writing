<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Amal’s grief is embodied with visceral specificity—knuckles white, geode warm in her palm—and her motivation arises organically from trauma without therapy-speak. Her contradictory impulses (scientific rigor vs. emotional desperation) act simultaneously in scene, especially when feeding “the echo of her loss into the equations as a tangible force.” The final choice—staring at resonance coordinates instead of rebooting systems—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: she abandons immediate protocol for a cosmic target. Interiority remains tightly bound to present pressure, avoiding diagnostic abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Amal crystallizes her stance upon discovering the resonance signature, foreclosing technical recovery for metaphysical pursuit. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through sensory and conceptual layering until the quantum foam spike reweights all prior grief. Cost is legible in the final image: “the grief was still there… but it now had a trajectory.” Orientation anchors cleanly within 30 words (“orbital observatory,” “Amal,” post-missile aftermath), and the circuit-breaker timeframe tightens pressure without contrivance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orbital observatory functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: system failure creates the narrow window for discovery, and spatial choreography (console, viewport, wall breaker) remains coherent. The geode and Earth’s “serene blue lie” charge the final image, with the crystal reflecting coordinates like a talisman. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—ticking capacitors, warm stone, coolant chime—filtered through Amal’s traumatized perception. No white-room syndrome; every object serves pressure or closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locating where unused potential pools—is signaled early and deepens via perturbation theory into a cosmic theft framework. Escalation is driven by Amal’s agency: refining boundary conditions under time pressure, feeding grief into equations. The meaningful tightening occurs when the array fails, forcing her to work within cooling breakers—a constraint that shapes tactics and culminates in the resonance discovery. Cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices system stability for metaphysical truth, crystallizing her hunt’s new vector.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from the collision of physics and mourning: potential as current, lives as displaced water. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—the reservoir isn’t a place but a harmonic frequency—reweighting the wedding crater as not just loss but stolen futures humming in quantum foam. No moralizing; subtext thrives in the geode’s dual role as relic and lens. The final image (“terrible, beautiful coordinates”) embraces complexity without false equivalence—grief persists, but now has direction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is single, stable, and deeply focalized through Amal’s physicist-poet sensibility. Voice modulates under pressure: sentences shorten during data sifting (“Her fingers flew…”), then expand lyrically at revelation (“the music that would never be played still hummed”). Diction blends technical precision (“tensors,” “quantum foam”) with poetic embodiment (“cold, dense star in her chest”), never slipping into academic register. Perceptual signature is consistent—she sees equations as prayers, grief as measurable force—making voice inseparable from character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density: “potential is a current, and it can be diverted” compresses theme, motive, and world logic in one line. Figurative language is pattern-taught (water displacement, music/chord metaphors) and payoff-earned at closure. No loops or scaffold; sentence rhythms vary purposefully—staccato during crisis, flowing at epiphany. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in “intangibly tangible echo,” but clarity never suffers, and the final paragraph’s propulsion toward “trajectory” is flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality lies in fusing theoretical physics with bereavement as active investigation—not metaphor but method. The “reservoir of unused potential” reframes loss as cosmic violation, fresh yet inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk: treating grief as quantifiable input in tensor equations, which pays off when the solution appears as harmonic frequency. Voice, concept, and setting cohere into singular vision; no template echoes. Geode-as-lens and observatory-as-lab transform tropes through specific, irreplaceable choices.</comment>
