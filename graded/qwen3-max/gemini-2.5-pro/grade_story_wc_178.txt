<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kavi’s frugality and empirical devotion are embodied in every action—from hoarding starlight to sweeping away his altar—making his final renunciation of physical proof feel inevitable. His internal contradiction (rigorous logic deployed in service of faith) operates simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The cost is visible: he trades permanence for private truth, accepting isolation as the price of revelation. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in tactile precision (“not a single grain... wasted”).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sky’s secret is revealed not through divine spectacle but geometric alignment, reweighting empiricism as a form of devotion. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens through layered sensory and symbolic density until starlight “thickens” into revelation. Cost is legible in Kavi’s dismantling: knowledge exists only in his mind, unshareable and ephemeral. Orientation is immediate (“hollowed-out days between kings”), and causality holds via meticulous ritual logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ziggurat observatory functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its polished floor enables the obsidian diagram, and its height isolates Kavi from political chaos below. Babylonian palace details (“glazed brick,” “plundered gold”) are filtered through Kavi’s contempt for materialism, avoiding tourist cataloging. Final image is charged by setting: the hidden nebula blooms precisely where cosmic dust once obscured it—a spatial payoff earned by his vantage. Environment actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—glimpsing the unknown through mathematical purity—is signaled early and tightens when Kavi risks his life’s work on a silent ritual. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each precise movement (drawing lines, placing tile) narrows options toward irreversible commitment. Cost is unmistakable: he gains transcendent knowledge but must erase all evidence, ensuring solitude. Coincidence never resolves; planetary alignment is a window he exploits, not a deus ex machina.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: conservation as sacred discipline, where frugality becomes communion. The nebula’s revelation reframes science as mystical inquiry—not stated, but shown through Kavi’s dismantling of his altar. Final image reweights prior material: the “vault of his quiet, devoted mind” transforms hoarding from flaw to virtue. No moralizing; resonance lives in the contrast between generals weighing gold and Kavi keeping star-clouds.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is rigorously controlled, with a perceptual signature that blends astronomer’s precision (“cuneiform numerals,” “planetary orbits”) and poetic restraint (“starlight... thickened”). Syntax modulates under pressure: short clauses during ritual (“He knelt. Placed the tile.”), lyrical flow in revelation. Voice remains consistent—no register drift into academic jargon—and elision (e.g., skipping the hum’s source) is pattern-taught and paid off by cosmic ambiguity. Distinct rhythm mirrors Kavi’s thrift: no wasted words.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “clawed at the violet sky,” “dusky harmony prevailed” do double duty establishing mood and character bias. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, plot, or interiority. Figurative language is coherent (starlight as liquid, silence as hoarded resource) and peaks without muddle. Final paragraph’s cadence (“swept... wiped... leaving no trace”) enacts the theme of erasure through syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms the “wise astronomer” trope through specificity: his faith is encrypted in prime numbers, his magic square a tool of calculation, not mysticism. The premise—using math to unveil cosmic secrets during political collapse—feels fresh because stakes are personal, not apocalyptic. Risk-taking (quiet climax without thunderclaps) heightens emotional truth. Vision coheres: every element serves Kavi’s ethos of invisible devotion.</comment>
