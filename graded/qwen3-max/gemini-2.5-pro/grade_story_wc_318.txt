<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s mournfully eager nature manifests in embodied, contradictory actions—spectral yet tactile, desperate yet tender—and his motivation to restore laughter drives every micro-choice. His love is shown through the leaf blower as conduit, not stated abstractly. The wife and son react with credible emotional complexity, avoiding sentimentality. Final smile carries earned fragility, not forced resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the wife’s tear-smile reconfigures grief into fragile hope, with clear cost (three seasons of silence, his spectral limbo). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via sensory echoes, engine roar, and lullaby distortion until the hallway becomes a resonant chamber of memory. Orientation is immediate (“house,” “hourglass,” “garage”) and functional disorientation (ghost POV) pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The leaf blower, pull cord, tiled hallway, and dust motes function as micro-settings that constrain and charge the narrative. The echo chamber tunnel isn’t backdrop—it amplifies both mechanical scream and phantom melody, directly shaping the wife’s recognition. Sensory detail is selective (plastic grip, brittle leaves) and filtered through the ghost’s longing. Final image gains weight because the tool and space are irreplaceable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring lost laughter—is signaled early and deepens through the ghost’s escalating effort (three pulls, engine scream, hallway performance). Agency is non-traditional but potent: his orchestration forces family out of stasis. Cost is felt (his spectral helplessness, their stagnant grief) and tightens options—only noise can breach silence. Escalation is driven by his mournful eagerness under an Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: tending to the unspoken via mechanical roar and half-sung lullaby reframes haunting as care. No moralizing—resonance arises from the wife hearing her husband’s hum beneath engine shriek. The final smile reweights all prior silence without resolving it, embracing ambiguity. Recurring images (leaves, dust, hourglass) accrue meaning organically, never token.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is singular, lyrical, and tightly focalized through the ghost’s perceptual signature—e.g., “dust motes danced in slivers of afternoon light,” “phantom melody of an old folk song.” Syntax modulates with pressure: short, sharp clauses during engine start; flowing cadence in memory. No head-hopping; multi-POV glimpses (wife, son) are external, observed. Diction stays within ghost’s lexicon—no register drift or exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or stakes. Figurative language is purposeful (“silence so dense it felt like a physical weight,” “leaf blower symphony conductor”) and consistent. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Final paragraph’s rhythm softens with the engine, mirroring earned peace—line-level craft serves emotional arc without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise transforms cliché (ghost haunting home) into fresh emotional mechanics: noise as love language, leaf blower as instrument of grief-work. Every element—macerating leaves, off-key lullabies, echo chamber—feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk (ghost POV without dialogue) heightens stakes by limiting expression to sound and wind. Vision is cohesive, specific, and free of template tropes.</comment>
