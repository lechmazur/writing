<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Finn’s resilient positivity is embodied through micro-choices—adjusting the radio, interpreting patterns—not declared. His motivation crystallizes believably from observation under pressure, and his final act carries conceptual cost: he becomes a permanent liminal figure. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest as physical resonance (“hum in his bones”) and tactile focus (salt-stiffened jacket). The only near-slip is Captain Eva’s abrupt recovery, but Finn’s isolation preserves his arc’s integrity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Finn doesn’t escape but heals a rupture, reweighting reality itself. The “permanent transient” final image makes cost undeniable—his awareness forever altered. Disorientation is taught early (“slide out of reality”) and pays off in the grotto’s geometry-driven resolution. Clocks running sideways isn’t gimmickry; it’s causal scaffolding for the temporal eddy premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The spectral grotto constrains choice: its silence demands non-engine solutions, its starlight provides the pattern Finn must replicate. The hourglass and frost aren’t backdrop—they’re active tools that charge the climax. Sensory hierarchy narrows under crisis (sound → light → touch), and the harbor’s return contrasts with visceral specificity (“greasy fog”). Final image ties setting to theme: docks are now thresholds between possibilities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mending fractured reality—is signaled by the empty hourglass and deepened when Finn decodes the radio’s patterned static. His agency drives escalation: matching frequency to starlight isn’t luck but earned synthesis. Cost is legible in his Charged Poise ending—he’s bound to seams forever—but the container ship lie slightly softens consequence, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through interconnectedness: radio static, frost, starlight all share geometry, implying reality’s fragility. No moralizing; insight arises from Finn’s hands-on labor. Final image reweights the commute as metaphysical stewardship, not transit. Ambiguity lingers (Are other seams out there?), but the cost—permanent liminality—grounds it in emotional truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled single-third, filtering everything through Finn’s salt-calloused perception. Voice modulates rhythmically: short clauses during crisis (“He twisted the dials”), lyrical flow in wonder (“crystalline walls woven from solidified moonlight”). Perceptual signature is consistent—professional deckhand noticing engine thrums, deck plates, tea-break hourglass. Zero head-hopping; even Eva’s amnesia serves Finn’s isolation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “bead of water skittering off a waxed leaf” establishes tone economically. Figurative language is purposeful (grotto’s “solidified moonlight” echoes later in silvery sand). Minor flaw: “resonant hum that vibrated up from the deck plates into his bones” slightly over-modifies, but clarity holds. Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors closure—steady, weighted, inevitable.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms commuter-ferry tropes via quantum seam theory grounded in sensory detail. Risk-taking (clocks running sideways, merging timelines) heightens stakes without gimmickry—the radio symphony feels earned. Originality lies in making cosmic repair tactile: a deckhand’s hands weaving static into salvation. Vision coheres perfectly: every element serves the liminal sailor conceit.</comment>
