<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelan’s interiority is concrete and consistent—motivated by quiet reverence, embodied in tactile gestures (cracking leather, palm vibration), and culminating in a micro-choice (humming reassurance) that renounces intervention for guidance. The final act of psychic skimming feels earned through centuries of listening, with the cost being the surrender of detachment to emotional engagement. No diagnostic label-speak or unearned epiphany mars the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kaelan forecloses passive observation by actively releasing the pulse, achieving navigation-through-stillness at the cost of emotional insulation. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the canyon’s echoes intensify until the flock’s flight fractures, then reconfigures meaning. Cost is legible in the “inert” arrowhead and the “thread of consciousness” unfurling—a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The towers of bone aren’t backdrop but active constraint: their acoustics shape perception, their ribs form Kaelan’s perch, and their fossilized scale dwarfs human sorrow. The obsidian arrowhead functions as micro-setting—its volcanic glass traps the pulse, and its handling channels the story’s resolution. Final image (“thread of consciousness”) is charged by the canyon’s silence, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is deepened when the wandering pulse demands ethical action without physical intrusion. The tightening occurs when Kaelan chooses harmonic resonance over extraction, narrowing options from passive witness to active release. Cost is felt in the relinquishment of neutrality; agency lies in attention and will, not force.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the interplay of memory, responsibility, and non-intrusive healing—never stated, only embodied. The final hum (“They are safe… You can rest”) offers a non-literal answer to the central question: navigation isn’t spatial but empathetic. Closure reweights the entire premise—stone-skimming becomes soul-guiding—without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled, filtered through Kaelan’s sensory and spiritual attunement (“every whisper became a chorus”). Voice modulates from meditative stillness to focused intensity during the flock reading, then softens into peace. Syntax mirrors rhythm of wind and echo—long, flowing sentences break into terse beats during revelation (“The pattern reformed…”). No head-hopping; perceptual signature is distinct and sustained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “wind, a patient sculptor,” “frantic, silent scream trapped in volcanic glass.” Figurative language is precise and cumulative, never muddled. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. No loops, scaffold, or register drift—elevated diction remains within Kaelan’s lexicon. Final line (“quiet, knowing peace”) resonates without overstatement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis: harmonic stone-skimming as psychic resonance, grief as acoustic haunting, bird-flight as divination. Tropes (arrowhead, bone towers) are transformed through specific ritual logic. The risk—resolving conflict via empathy rather than action—heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular, inevitable in hindsight, and deeply integrated.</comment>
