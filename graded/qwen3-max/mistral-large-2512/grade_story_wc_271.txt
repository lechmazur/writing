<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is concrete, embodied, and free of diagnostic labels—her trauma manifests through tactile actions (tracing the veil, burying the photo) and somatic responses (freezing at drone hum). Mira’s “quietly talented” trait is shown through precise horticultural gestures, not stated. The final act—tending the sprouted cutting—is a credible endurance earned by prior causality, foreclosing healing as an option while accepting its cost: she no longer crumples the photo, but keeps it smoothed, a quiet renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lena chooses daily tending over belief in miracles, with visible cost (the unhealed wound of her sister’s death). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the orchid’s recurring presence reweights stillness from abstraction to lived defiance. The ledger’s final entry crystallizes the before/after: the orchid now *knows*, making endurance legible. No causality breaks; pressure tightens once via the drone-triggered freeze, which the terrarium ritual resolves without convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The arboretum isn’t backdrop—it constrains choice (glass panes fogged by salt limit visibility, cliff winds challenge growth) and charges closure: the orchid blooms *because* of drones, turning fragility into resistance. Sensory detail is selective and urgent (chlorophyll-stained hands, bone meal’s grit), filtered through Lena’s grief. The terrarium functions as micro-setting—its glass vibrates with threat, yet houses the “pearl of stillness,” directly shaping Lena’s climactic breath.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—endurance vs. annihilation—is signaled early (“didn’t believe in healing”) and deepens when drones return, forcing Lena to choose paralysis or anchoring. The meaningful tightening occurs in the freeze: her body locks, but Mira’s cue (“look at the orchid”) shifts agency to observation-as-resistance. Cost is felt—Lena’s pulse slows only after acknowledging the flower’s defiance, proving stillness requires active will, not passive hope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the orchid’s bloom during drone hum reweights “stillness” from passivity to resilient attention. No moralizing—insight arises from burying the photo as seed, yielding sprouts that prove endurance, not healing. The ledger’s final line (“It knows”) offers non-literal closure: life persists *because* of chaos, not despite it. Subtext thrives in silence (Mira’s wordless teaching) and charged objects (the smoothed photo).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, with perceptual signature rooted in Lena’s trauma (noticing creases as “weight of explosion,” engines by pitch). Prose rhythm modulates under pressure—short clauses during freeze (“Her body locked, her breath shallow”), lyrical flow in calm. Dialogue is sparse but potent: Mira’s lines carry subtext (“You’re the one who survived”) and avoid exposition. No head-hopping; even Mira’s motives are inferred through action, not interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: “glass panes fogged with salt and time” establishes setting, mood, and thematic decay in one stroke. Figurative language is coherent (orchid as “fragile defiance,” photo creases as “weight of explosion”) and never muddled. Zero paraphrase loops; sentences vary syntactically (fragments for tension, complex for reflection). Final line (“The cutting needed water”) echoes opening soil imagery, closing the loop with understated propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms war-trauma tropes through horticultural specificity: healing isn’t sought, but endurance is cultivated via somatic botany. The drone-strike wedding survivor finds agency not in vengeance but in tending life that blooms amid threat. Fresh inflection in the orchid’s behavior—it listens, it knows—making resilience ecological, not individual. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over plot) heightens stakes by tying survival to fragile, recurring beauty.</comment>
