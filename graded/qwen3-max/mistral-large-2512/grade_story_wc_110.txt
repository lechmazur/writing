<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira and Elias exhibit layered interiority—Mira’s guarded observation, Elias’s anxious surveillance—both rooted in consistent traits that drive their micro-choices (pocketing the stub, withholding the lens). Their contradictory impulses (desire for connection vs. fear of betrayal) act simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The final exchange (“Maybe not at first… Now I think we’re both tired of pretending”) earns its emotional shift through prior tension, with visible relational cost. Voice distinction in dialogue is subtle but credible, avoiding convergence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lens returned, silence reconfigured from barrier to beginning, with conceptual cost (years of mutual mistrust now acknowledged). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds via density of ticket stubs, doodles as map, rain-washed lies—culminating in a cadence shift toward openness. Orientation is clear by line 30; causality holds without gaps. Cost is legible in the final image: “the silence between them didn’t feel like a barrier. It felt like a beginning.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt and projector lens function as micro-settings that charge the closure—the forecourt’s hum softens post-honesty, the lens becomes a “promise.” Sensory detail (scent of celluloid, slick cobblestones) is selective and POV-filtered, never touristy. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout. However, the setting doesn’t actively constrain choices beyond mood; it reflects rather than pressures, preventing a 9+ score under the gate rule.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—trust in intimacy—is signaled early (“silence felt heavier”) and deepens when Elias reveals his eavesdropping. The tightening occurs when Mira calls him out (“You’re lying”), forcing a trade-off: secrecy vs. vulnerability. Cost is felt (“needed to know who I could trust”) and crystallizes in the final stance. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (Mira’s confrontation, Elias’s confession), though the pressure peak leans slightly more on revelation than active choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—honesty as liberation from self-imposed isolation—emerges through concrete particulars: ticket stubs as breadcrumbs, the lens as withheld truth. The final image reweights the premise without moralizing: silence transforms from prison to possibility. Subtext thrives in gesture (tucking stub, brushing lens) and charged pauses. No false equivalence; Elias’s method is flawed but human, Mira’s complicity acknowledged, yielding resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Mira, with perceptual signature evident in her archival mindset (“hoarding secrets like treasures”). Prose rhythm modulates with tension—longer sentences for atmosphere, clipped phrases during confrontation (“You’re lying”). Dialogue carries subtext (“Would you have told me the truth?”) and distinct idiom. No head-hopping; free indirect style cleanly merges narration and thought. Voice remains consistent even under stress, avoiding register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: “jagged lines that might have been mountains or teeth” does double duty (image + character insight). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual breath. Minor overwriting in “crystal whispering forecourt” risks purple prose but pays off in the closing hum. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; information density high. One slight redundancy: “faint beam across the empty lobby” followed by “projector whirred to life” could be tighter, but momentum holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cinema-as-archive metaphor feels fresh through specific textures: celluloid scent, cryptic doodles as intelligence-gathering, registrar as secret-keeper. Transformation test passed—swapping setting or occupation would break the logic of eavesdropping via discarded tickets. Risk-taking in quiet climax pays off; no gimmickry. However, “freed by honesty” borders on familiar, saved by execution. Originality stems from synthesis, not novelty, with emotional specificity anchoring universals.</comment>
