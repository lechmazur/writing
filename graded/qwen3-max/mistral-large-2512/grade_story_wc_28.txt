<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is vividly embodied—her calloused hands, splintered memories, and tactile engagement with tesserae reveal a psyche shaped by trauma and resolve. Her contradictory impulses (vengeance vs. mercy, past vs. present) act simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final choice—to preserve Amira’s name while redefining its meaning—is earned through prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through concrete action and sensory detail.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Liora’s decision crystallizes options under Accumulative/Textural drive lens, with the mosaic’s reassembly reweighting memory and mercy. Cost is legible in her blood-drawn palm and the irreversible act of embedding lapis where a name once was. Orientation is immediate and functional disorientation (retrocognition) pays off at closure. The inferred lens—Accumulative/Textural—holds consistently, with pattern intensification (mosaic → name → redefinition) driving stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The shattered sky, charred cedar, and scattered tesserae aren’t backdrop—they constrain Liora’s choices and charge the final image. The stepping stone functions as micro-setting: its chipped patterns guide her fingers and force confrontation with Amira’s legacy. Sensory hierarchy reflects crisis (focus on touch, dim light, scent of ash), and spatial choreography remains coherent. The plaza evolves from ruin to Courtyard of the Unbroken Name through embodied interaction, not declaration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to erase or redeem Amira’s act—is signaled early and deepens when Liora uncovers the name. The tightening occurs in her choice to retain “Amira” but redefine it, foreclosing vengeance with tangible cost (blood, emotional exposure). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each tessera placed increases density until the final reconfiguration. Agency is clear—Liora’s micro-choices (turning stone, pressing lapis) drive escalation without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the mosaic’s fragmentation and reassembly embody the tension between erasure and aberrant mercy. The ending offers a non-literal answer—mercy isn’t forgetting but recontextualizing harm within rebuilding. No moralizing; resonance arises from Liora’s bloodied palm and the renamed courtyard. Ambiguity lingers (Can Amira be forgiven? Can Liora?), but the stance is clear: empathy requires steel, not amnesia.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose voice is distinct—lyrical yet precise, with rhythm modulating under pressure (shorter sentences during discovery of “Amira”). Perceptual signature is consistent: Liora notices patterns, scents, textures tied to memory and labor. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Compression is purposeful (retrocognition conveyed through sensory echoes), and elision (no dialogue) serves the solitary, ritualistic tone without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or conflict. Figurative language is controlled (“sky split like broken glass,” “heart a quiet furnace”) and coheres without muddle. Minor overwriting in “warm coldness” risks abstraction, but it’s redeemed by contextual embodiment. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; syntax varies naturally. Final paragraph’s propulsion (“She picked up another tessera”) delivers quiet momentum without slack.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms post-catastrophe tropes through specificity: rebuilding isn’t heroism but daily, bloody labor; mercy isn’t absolution but re-naming. The synthesis of retrocognition, mosaic craft, and linguistic magic feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk—making the antagonist a remembered child, not a present villain—heightens moral complexity without gimmickry. Vision is singular: a gentle radical who wields memory as both wound and tool.</comment>
