<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tuner’s motivation—restoring resonance, not rebuilding physically—is consistent and embodied through precise actions (e.g., matching phantom footsteps). His “infinitely patient” trait manifests as tactical restraint, avoiding forced rhythms that might shatter echoes. Interiority remains concrete (“fingers stained with patina,” “breath steady”), avoiding diagnostic labels. Final renunciation—leaving without looking back—earns Earned Stasis with visible cost: he forgoes witnessing the town’s restored listening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the town is “listening” again, a reconfiguration of its silence into receptivity, with conceptual cost—the tuner’s departure implies this balance requires no keeper, yet his labor was essential. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; pressure escalates via deepening sonic density (click-click → murmurs → golden light). Orientation anchors are clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The archway functions as micro-setting and fulcrum, directly constraining the tuner’s method (“built on a fault line… of time”). Cobblestones, dust motes, and the fork’s vibrations are tactile, sensory, and causally active—not decorative. Final image of “golden shimmer” tracing invisible feet charges closure with irreplaceable specificity. Every detail serves rhythm or resonance, never stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rebalancing Hollow’s End through resonance—is signaled early and tightens via the tuner’s calibrated pacing and risk of shattering ghosts. Agency is expressed through attention and endurance, not force; cost is felt in his solitude and the fragility of success. Escalation follows Accumulative logic: sound layers deepen until light emerges. No false resolution—balance is delicate, not permanent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—memory as recoverable resonance, not restoration—emerges through action, not assertion. The final image reweights the premise: listening matters more than rebuilding. Avoids moralizing; complexity lingers (ghosts aren’t spirits but echoes). Subtext thrives in silence, scuffed boots, and the fork’s hum—no overt allegory or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through the tuner’s perceptual signature (“wind carried the ghost of a blacksmith’s hammer”). Voice modulates rhythmically: short clauses during tension (“He struck the fork again”), lyrical flow in reflection. Syntax mirrors patience—measured, deliberate. No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon (“patina,” “fulcrum”) without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences vary rhythmically to mirror ritual pacing. Figurative language (“cloak the color of old bruises”) is consistent and grounded. One minor scaffold: “He had come before the collapse…” slightly interrupts immediacy but serves necessary backstory within BRR limits. No loops, mixed metaphors, or artifacts dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: bell tuning as temporal archaeology, reviving towns via acoustic memory. Transforms ghost-town trope through specific mechanics (footstep rhythm, tuning fork) and philosophical stance (balance over reconstruction). Risk-taking—lyric accumulative structure—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular, not templated.</comment>
