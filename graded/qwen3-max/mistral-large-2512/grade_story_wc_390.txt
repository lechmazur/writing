<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s internal conflict—between duty and guilt—is embodied through tactile detail (cold key, resonator dials) and credible micro-choices (lunging for the key despite risk). His final act of touching the artifact feels earned by his established history and moral stance. The scavenger, though present, functions more as pressure than fully realized foil, slightly limiting relational depth. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summarizing mars peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias accepts the weight of regret rather than seeking escape, crystallized in the final line about “learning to carry the weight.” The drive lens is Causal—each action (resonator adjustment, lighthouse activation, plunge) follows from motive and prior setup. Cost is legible: physical danger, emotional exposure, and the scavenger’s shattered ambition. Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains choice: creaking piers limit movement, unstable ice threatens collapse, and the lighthouse’s sonic beam is both tool and environmental feature. The golden sunset tightens the temporal window, charging every decision. Final image (“breath no longer a ghost”) ties atmosphere to interior transformation. Every sensory detail serves pressure or character perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting the key from misuse—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes the scavenger’s method risks destabilizing the ice. The meaningful tightening occurs when he chooses to amplify the lighthouse hum, accepting shared peril. Cost is felt: near-fall, exposure of personal guilt, and irreversible engagement with the artifact. Escalation is protagonist-driven under a Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: absolution isn’t erasure but integration of regret. This insight arises from concrete struggle—not stated until the final exchange, where it reweights the entire premise without moralizing. The key’s shift from weapon to burden mirrors Elias’s internal reconfiguration. Subtext thrives in silence (the scavenger’s awe) and action (plunging hand), avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled single-third, filtered through Elias’s engineer sensibility—notice of brass dials, frost splinters, harmonic frequencies. Voice modulates under stress: shorter sentences during sprint, lyrical cadence at closure. No head-hopping; scavenger’s dialogue carries distinct idiom (“You’re the keeper… stealing”). Prose rhythm supports propulsion without sacrificing texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density: “frost settled into their cracks” conveys age, cold, and fragility in five words. Figurative language is purposeful (“creaking like old bones”) and consistent. Minor overwriting in one beat (“vibrations attuned to the guilt…”) slightly slows momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s clean syntax delivers closure without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>“Sonic absolution” transforms a familiar guilt/redemption trope through specific mechanics (vibrational matching, resonator tech) and setting (drift-ice marina with acoustic lighthouse). The fusion of maritime gothic and acoustic physics feels fresh yet inevitable. Risk-taking (making sound the vector of both danger and grace) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision is singular: fleshly ethereal tone sustained throughout.</comment>
