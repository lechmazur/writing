<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motivation—restoring buried faith—is rooted in consistent, embodied behavior (digging, tracing roots, placing the relic) and deepens through physical struggle. His internal contradiction (doubt vs. conviction) manifests not as alternating summaries but through tactile persistence amid exhaustion. The final recognition—not worship but kinship with the radiant figure—feels earned by his labor, not declared. However, the “warmly curious hum” borders on label-speak without sufficient bodily grounding to fully satisfy the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: faith isn’t doctrine but patient, subterranean life awaiting tending. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via relics, frescoes, bones—culminating in the sundial’s placement that reweights all prior fragments. Cost is legible: twenty years of exile, blistered hands, and the elders’ scorn are crystallized in the final line about “right hands.” Orientation is clear by line 2; causality flows through purposeful wandering, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard functions as micro-setting: pomegranate roots coiling around bones directly guide the protagonist’s path and charge the climax (roots bloom where shadow touches). Sensory detail is selective (myrrh, damp earth, groaning stone) and filtered through obsession, not cataloging. The sundial base constrains choice—it must fit the pedestal—and the mosaic floor of bones shapes the final image. Only minor deduction: “jagged silhouette” slightly generic compared to later specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—faith as living continuity, not dogma—is signaled early and tightens when the shrine fresco mirrors his relic, raising emotional stakes. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to dig, follow roots, place the relic. Cost is felt physically (blistered hands, aching back) and socially (elders’ scorn), culminating in the quiet cost of lifelong solitude now lifted. One tightening suffices, but the piece offers layered pressure without overreach.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: faith as roots, not temples; journeys interrupted but not abandoned. The final image—bones blooming into green roots—offers a non-literal answer to loss: continuity requires tending, not resurrection. Avoids moralizing; the woman’s dialogue (“You’ve returned”) implies cyclical return, not salvation. Resists binaries: faith isn’t lost or found, but dormant—a complexity sustained without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature: attention fixates on tactile relics (sundial brass, limestone groans) and botanical-anatomical fusion (roots through ribs). Voice modulates under pressure—syntax shortens during digging, expands in awe at frescoes. No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon (“wound in the earth,” not academic theology). Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors opening, creating resonant closure without echo.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “roots coiled around skeletal fingers” does setting, character, and theme work. Figurative language is coherent (orchard as library, faith as roots) without muddle. Minor scaffold: “Days bled into nights” slightly cliché; “warmly curious hum” risks abstraction. No loops or register drift; sentence openings vary. Closure beat (“patient as roots in the dark”) earns its lyricism through prior grounding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms diaspora-return and faith-restoration tropes through specific synthesis: catacomb orchard, sundial-as-relic, faith-as-botanical continuity. Emotional truth anchors novelty—the protagonist’s labor feels human, not mythic. Bold risk: climax hinges on quiet recognition, not spectacle, yet stakes feel high. Vision is singular: voice, setting, and concept cohere without safety-hedging. No derivative echoes; every element serves the core metaphor without ornament.</comment>
