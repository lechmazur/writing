<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her belief in “windows of connection” drives her actions, and her final renunciation (“She would never tell”) is earned through prior causality. Her flaw (the need to expose truth) directly leads to the revelation that forces her silence. The red-coated woman’s appearance triggers no diagnostic self-awareness; emotion remains embodied in breath, touch, and ritual. However, the lack of a second on-page character limits relational crucible depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara forecloses truth-telling with visible cost (“Some wrecks were meant to stay buried”). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—dream fragments coalesce into revelation, reweighting the stake from salvage to silence. The shrine’s ice groaning “in relief” crystallizes the conceptual repricing. Cost is legible in the final image: truth woven into her bones but never spoken.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glacier shrine functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—Mara returns to it repeatedly, and its candlelight, ice, and altar anchor all key decisions. The melted snow globe evolves from object to charged symbol, culminating in the tear-like drop that enables closure. Sensory detail (fogged glass, residual warmth, imaginary seawater) is filtered through Mara’s professional perception. Environment directly charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—salvaging truth from wreckage—is signaled early and deepens when Mara learns the wreck was sabotage, not accident. Her agency drives escalation: she tracks descendants, interprets dreams, and confronts the quartermaster. The meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes the dead “wanted silence,” foreclosing her path. Cost is felt in her silent departure, though the final confrontation leans slightly toward revelation over tangible loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the cameo, red coat, and snow globe accrue meaning without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—truth is sometimes too ruinous to speak—and reweights the premise: salvaging echoes may unearth complicity, not purity. Ambiguity lingers (Was justice possible? Is silence betrayal?), but complexity is anchored in Mara’s choice, not abstraction. No thematic echo or sermonizing mars the closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled single-third with a distinct perceptual signature—Mara notices heat, fog, saltwater, and dream logic through her salvager’s lens. Voice modulates under pressure: lyrical in reflection (“truth woven carefully into her bones”), taut in action (“She cupped the snow globe”). Syntax varies purposefully; rhythm supports cadence shifts from investigation to resignation. No head-hopping, filter-verb stacks, or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is restrained and coherent (“breath curling into the dark,” “fragments like shards of glass”). No paraphrase loops, template cadence, or mixed metaphors. Final line (“Some wrecks were meant to stay buried”) recharges the opening wreck image with earned weight. Minor deduction for slight overuse of “she” openings in mid-section, but no artifact dulls closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost whisperer tropes with Arctic salvage and dream archaeology feels inevitable in hindsight. The quartermaster twist reframes maritime disaster as moral catastrophe, not tragedy. Risk-taking (silence as climax, dream-based investigation) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Every element—snow globe, red coat, cameo—feels irreplaceable and grounded in Mara’s specific worldview, avoiding generic supernatural templates.</comment>
