<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her observational skill, emotional restraint, and quiet grief shape every micro-choice. Her decision to press the mainspring against the fracture feels earned by her established relationship with time, ghosts, and loss. The cost is legible in what she carries (weight lifting) and what she accepts (ongoing vigilance). No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied through tactile detail and silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mira chooses ritual over repair, sealing a wound rather than fixing a machine, with felt cost in her enduring burden. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story deepens through layered dust, sensory decay, and pattern breaks (e.g., trembling cobwebs, wrong spirals). The crack’s sealing reweights the premise: time can be mended, but only by those who notice. Every beat tightens around her singular agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures Mira’s choices: the peeling marquee frames her transgression, the child’s handprint in dust justifies her theory, and the ceiling fracture emerges from spatial logic. The mainspring barrel (tool-as-setting) constrains the climax. Sensory hierarchy reflects her profession: she notices hinges, dust strata, brass wear—not décor. Final image of packed tools charges closure with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—containing temporal wounds before they split reality—is signaled early and tightened when Mira recognizes the “wound” isn’t just a ghost. Her agency drives escalation: observation → interpretation → intervention. Cost is unmistakable: she bears eternal watchfulness (“keep watching the ceilings”) even as relief arrives. Under Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via pattern disruption (dust circles, silent laughter), not external force.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: some wounds aren’t hauntings but ruptures in time itself, requiring witness, not exorcism. The final image—Mira walking away with cool barrel, ghosts sleeping—offers non-literal resolution: healing isn’t erasure but containment. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers (Will cracks return? Can she keep up?). Recurring dust and brass reweight meaning without tokenism—they’re tools of both diagnosis and ritual.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: Mira notices mechanical wear, sedimentary dust, absence-as-presence. Syntax modulates under pressure—shorter clauses during fracture discovery, lyrical flow during memory-laced action. Voice remains consistent, never slipping into exposition or omniscience. Prose as character: technical precision (“mainspring barrel,” “gearbox”) fused with poetic restraint (“silence heavier than machinery’s groan”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is purposeful (“silence heavier than machinery’s groan,” “dust layered like sediment”) without purple excess. Rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. One minor slip: “burning” to “cool” transition slightly abrupt, but closure propulsion compensates. No loops, scaffold, or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms ghost tropes through occupational specificity (elevator tech as temporal custodian) and conceptual rigor (time leaking as architectural wound). The mainspring-as-temporal-bandage feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk: resolving supernatural crisis through quiet ritual, not confrontation. Vision coheres fully—tone, setting, method, and closure fuse into singular artistic stance. No derivative echoes; freshness rooted in tactile detail, not quirk.</comment>
