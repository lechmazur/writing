<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The summoner’s interiority is richly embodied—his tactile engagement with earth, paper, and water conveys emotion without diagnostic labels. His motivation (to hush a prophecy) evolves credibly into renunciation, and his final choice to release the crane’s wing carries quiet cost: solitude becomes chosen, not imposed. However, internal contradiction remains muted; the shift from obsession to peace lacks a visible struggle or misstep that would deepen flaw-driven causality. The absence of another character limits relational crucible, but single-POV execution is otherwise masterful.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the summoner renounces the prophecy’s burden, foreclosing interpretation in favor of release, with felt cost in the dissolving ink and departed crane. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—silence accrues meaning through sensory density, culminating in a cadence shift (“He did not look back”) that crystallizes poise. Orientation anchors are clear by line 3, and the single scene adheres to scope. Cost is legible in the final image: peace gained through relinquishment of meaning itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven isn’t backdrop—it actively shapes the summoner’s tactics: the brook enables release, damp earth grounds his ritual, shadows permit vulnerability. The recurring “terrestrially cosmic hum” charges the final image, echoing in his bones as he departs. Sensory detail is selective and pressure-aligned (e.g., cool air, warm paper), never decorative. The micro-setting—the crane’s wing in water—constrains the climax: only here can the prophecy dissolve, making place indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—releasing a coded prophecy—is signaled early and tightens when the summoner realizes it’s “a wound,” not a warning. The meaningful deepening occurs at the brook: unfolding the wing becomes an act of surrender, narrowing options from deciphering to dissolving. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence intervenes. Cost is unmistakable: the loss of meaning itself, paid when ink bleeds into water. Under an Accumulative lens, this reweighting of silence over code suffices for high-band pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: meaning must sometimes be relinquished to find peace. The crane’s wing—once vessel of prophecy, then vessel of release—shifts from burden to buoyancy, offering a non-literal answer to the central question: Can silence heal? Final lines avoid moralizing; instead, “darkest light” and “steady, silent, and free” reprice knowledge as stillness. Subtext thrives in gesture (pressing paper to water) and image (spinning crane), resisting binaries while embracing ambiguity with emotional honesty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable, immersive, and perceptually distinct—the summoner notices creases “sharp as forgotten truths,” breath “curling like smoke,” shadows “soft as a smoothed hush.” Syntax modulates with emotional intensity: short clauses during release (“He pressed… watching…”), lyrical flow in reflection. No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon (no academic intrusions). The voice feels singular, rhythmic, and purposefully compressed, with elision taught early (“secrets only the night could understand”) and paid off in closure’s whispered departure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense, musical, and largely precise—sentences vary in length and structure, advancing atmosphere and character simultaneously. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “tranquil blaze burned within him—not the kind that consumed, but the kind that illuminated without heat” edges into explanatory redundancy. A paraphrase-loop exists between “mapping silence” and “learned to listen to what was not said.” These don’t obscure closure but prevent 9+; artifacts are confined to mid-text, sparing the ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story transforms familiar tropes (prophecy, origami crane, brookside ritual) through specificity: the “coded” prophecy as wound, silence as cartography, “terrestrially cosmic” as felt vibration. Emotional truth outweighs novelty—peace arrives not through victory but surrender. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight: only by releasing meaning can one hear silence. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative design, abstract stakes) heightens resonance without gimmickry, and the final image (“star—steady, silent, and free”) offers fresh inflection on inner peace.</comment>
