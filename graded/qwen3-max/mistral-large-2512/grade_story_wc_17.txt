<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception (“static before a storm,” “feverish” stone) and micro-choices (kneeling, flipping diaries). His motivation—deciphering his father’s obsession—is consistent and deepens under pressure. The final confrontation reveals credible endurance rather than tidy resolution, with legacy as burden made visceral. However, the woman’s sudden appearance lacks relational buildup, slightly flattening the crucible dynamic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density intensifies toward a Conceptual Repricing—walls remember, and forgetting has cost. Orientation is clear by line 3; closure lands via Charged Poise (Elias hovering over the map, walls humming in anticipation). The cost—being “consumed” by legacy—is legible in the final image. One meaningful deepening (diaries → map → woman’s revelation) suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage functions as active micro-setting: it constrains movement (“duck beneath”), emits warmth/vibration, and its scorched leaves signal unseen danger. The recurring ivy and stone directly charge the final image—the bare, symbol-covered room contrasts prior veiling, heightening thematic weight. Sensory hierarchy shifts appropriately under stress (touch over sight when kneeling). Environment irreplaceably shapes both tactics and closure resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unraveling the walls’ secret before being consumed—tightens decisively when Elias chooses to enter the door despite fear. Agency is maintained through diary use and tactile investigation; coincidence (finding the negative) complicates but doesn’t resolve. The cost—bearing legacy’s weight—is felt in his shaking hands and breath hitching. Escalation follows Accumulative logic: each sensory detail increases pressure until the woman’s arrival crystallizes stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as ecological responsibility, not mere curiosity. The walls’ sentience reframes climate collapse as erasure of witness, not just physical loss. Final image—Elias reaching toward the living map—offers non-literal answer: we must listen, even at personal cost. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers (will he be consumed or become cartographer?), yet resonance is undeniable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled, first-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature (“veins of a forgotten god,” “film negative strip”). Syntax modulates under pressure—shorter clauses during the shadow glimpse. Voice remains consistent, avoiding therapy-speak; diction (“brittle edges,” “warped with age”) reflects Elias’s archival mindset. No head-hopping; the woman’s dialogue carries subtext without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “pages singed but still legible in fragments” conveys backstory, object state, and emotional weight). Figurative language is coherent—ivy as “reverence,” walls “humming”—and avoids purple excess. Minor redundancy in “echoes of corridors” / “whispers of spaces,” but no scaffold loops. Final paragraph’s rhythm accelerates appropriately into the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: climate grief filtered through architectural sentience, not human survivors. The “cartographer” trope is transformed—mapping memory, not geography. Specificity (half-burned diaries, film negative) grounds the uncanny. Risk-taking (sentient walls, delayed antagonist reveal) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight, anchored in Elias’s tactile quest.</comment>
