<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mira’s grief is embodied with exquisite specificity—her polishing, folding, and refusal to serve the basilica reveal a hierarchy of values forged in loss. Her interior contradiction (desire to hold dreams vs. knowledge they must remain private) acts simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final crane-folding renunciation is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: she builds containers instead of seeking reunion. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mira forecloses pilgrimage-scale sharing to preserve intimate grief, crystallizing her stance with felt cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the density of dream-gem imagery, crane folds, and luminous torment intensifies until the final image reweights the entire premise. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty. Cost is legible in the ember-dimmed lantern and the next crane begun.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating island tea garden functions as micro-setting: its cloud-sea steam, crystalline bushes, and suspended grief-pressure directly shape Mira’s craft and isolation. The gem, crane paper, and lantern core are tools that constrain choice—only azure paper, only dream-polished gems. Final image charged by setting: the garden shivers during ascension, yet Mira remains grounded, reinforcing her descent-as-method. Sensory detail filtered through her professional bias and sorrow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving private grief against institutional co-option—is signaled early and deepens when Mira stops building for the basilica. The meaningful tightening occurs in her method shift: gem polishing as prayer, crane folding as funeral rite. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves tension. Cost is unmistakable: she endures luminous torment to keep her daughter’s dream unshared, a price paid in every folded crane.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: light requires containment, not display; grief’s grace is inseparable from its pain. The final image—Mira watching her daughter’s intact shadow in a captured dream—offers a non-literal answer to loss: you build vessels, not recoveries. No moralizing; resonance accrues through recurring objects (cranes, gems) that reweight meaning at closure. Subtext operates in silence, gesture, and the refusal to release cranes skyward.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful: Mira notices steam on leaves, violet shards, the texture of unwoven-dream cloth—all filtered through her craft and sorrow. Rhythmic control under pressure: short folds (“valley fold, mountain fold”) contrast lyrical grief passages. No head-hopping; single POV held with psychic distance calibrated to her knowledge. Voice modulates naturally—elevated diction (“luminous torment”) fits her artisan lexicon without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light/shadow/dream motifs) and pays off at closure without muddle. Zero paraphrase loops; syntactic variety supports emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in “luminous torment” passage slightly slows momentum, but clarity at closure remains intact—no artifact penalties applied.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Premise transforms tropes: detached shadows, dream-capturing lanterns, and floating islands become specific through Mira’s craft and grief. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight—her descent-while-ascending insight reframes all prior world logic. Bold risk in making grief generative rather than redemptive; closure affirms endurance without resolution. No derivative echoes; vision coheres as singular artistic stance.</comment>
