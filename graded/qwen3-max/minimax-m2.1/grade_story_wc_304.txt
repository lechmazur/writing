<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete and character-particular, rooted in her dual identity as beautician and mortician. Her micro-choices—pressing the emerald chip, reading static for patterns—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost. Contradictory impulses (preservation vs. release) act simultaneously without tidy resolution. The final renunciation feels earned by prior causality and consistent professional ethos.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the spark captured, the threshold relaxed, Mira descending with luminous burden. Cost is legible in the “weight of responsibility” and the irreversible act of preservation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density increases via aurora, static, and stone until the cadence shift at capture. Orientation anchors are clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto under aurora isn’t backdrop—it actively supplies light that mirrors the soul’s radiance and constrains perception. The emerald chip functions as micro-setting, its warmth and pulse guiding Mira’s hands. Sensory detail is selective (verdant light, iridescent shadows) and filtered through Mira’s trained attention. Final image charges closure: the stone now holds “living light,” irreplaceable without this environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capturing the last spark before oblivion—is signaled early and tightens as the spark “threatened to fade.” Escalation is driven by Mira’s agency: her infusion deepens pressure, narrowing options to a single decisive act. Cost is felt (“holy work,” “weight of responsibility”) but remains conceptual rather than visceral; a minor deduction for lack of tangible forfeiture beyond emotional burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: beauty as sacred resistance to oblivion, not denial of death. The final image—emerald holding “a captured fragment of pure being”—offers non-literal answer to whether essence endures. No moralizing; resonance arises from particulars (musician’s song, grandmother’s relic). Complexity is embraced: preservation is holy yet solitary, known only to Mira.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, with a distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices patterns in static, reads color as emotion. Voice modulates under pressure—sentences shorten during capture, syntax tightens. Diction (“radiant hush,” “gossamer veil”) stays within plausible lexicon of a poetic mortician. No head-hopping; prose rhythm supports thematic accumulation without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and dense, though occasional overwriting appears (“kaleidoscope of light and shadow that revealed itself only to those who knew how to look”). Minor scaffold in mid-section (“She had never spoken…”) slightly dulls momentum. No loops or register drift; final paragraph propels cleanly. Figurative coherence holds—aurora, static, and emerald weave consistently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mortuary care fused with metaphysical preservation via ancestral object and liminal space. Tropes (soul-spark, aurora) transformed by specificity—Mira’s profession, the musician’s final song, the chip’s generational weight. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular, inevitable in hindsight, fully committed to its premise.</comment>
