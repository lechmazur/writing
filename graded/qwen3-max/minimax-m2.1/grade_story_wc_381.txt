<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The summoner’s motivation—rooted in maternal memory and resistance to coerced fate—is rendered with visceral specificity. Her internal contradiction (mastery of summoning vs. desire to unmake) manifests through embodied micro-choices: tracing silence like braille, inviting rather than commanding the crane. The final renunciation of prophecy-as-decree is earned by her gradual epiphany about vibration and frequency, with the cost legible in her solitude and the irreversible downstream journey of the wing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: prophecy reframed from decree to desperate plea, with the cost felt in the summoner’s irreversible departure from court orthodoxy. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds through sensory density (water, paper, moonlight) until silence itself becomes the medium of transformation. The brook’s hush isn’t passive; it enables revelation. Every beat flows organically toward the crane’s descent, a decisive image that reweights all prior “noise” as human fear.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The brook functions as micro-setting: its murmurs shape tactics (she maps silence between them), and its current carries the origami wing away, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—moonlight on paper, frogs falling mid-croak—filtered through the summoner’s attunement to vibration. The nocturnal haven isn’t backdrop but active collaborator; stillness here is weaponized. The recurring crane wing constrains choice: she cannot destroy prophecy, only release it into flow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—hushing a coercive prophecy—is signaled early and deepens when the summoner realizes it’s a future self’s plea. Her agency lies in attention: choosing to listen without being consumed. The tightening occurs when smoothing silence alters the medium itself, foreclosing violent counter-magic. Cost is unmistakable: she walks away from court power into solitary understanding, the “tranquil blaze” burning with irreversible knowledge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the crane wing’s journey: prophecy as encoded trauma, not destiny. The final image—paper carried downstream—offers a non-literal answer: truth must flow, not be fixed. Subtext thrives in silence, water, and folded paper; no moralizing intrudes. The reweighting of “prophecy” from external decree to internal warning resonates beyond plot, inviting reflection on how we carry futures not chosen.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exquisite: the summoner notices ripples, creases, frequencies—details reflecting her training and trauma. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer, fluid sentences during ritual give way to crisp clarity at revelation (“She listened without fear”). Voice remains consistent in elevated diction because it’s character-bound (a court-trained mystic). No head-hopping; focalization is tight, with every image filtered through her terrestrially cosmic awareness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: “ghost-motes,” “cartographers once mapped stars,” “tranquil blaze” all do thematic and atmospheric work. Minor overwriting appears in “terrestrially cosmic truth had come to her gradually”—slightly abstract amid otherwise concrete epiphanies. But rhythm varies masterfully, and the final paragraph’s cadence mirrors water’s inevitability. No loops or scaffold; every sentence propels.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms prophecy tropes by grounding them in physics (vibration) and craft (origami, cartography). The “smoothed hush” method feels fresh yet inevitable, arising from the summoner’s unique synthesis of maternal memory and cosmic insight. Risk-taking—centering quietude over spectacle—heightens stakes by making failure internal (being consumed by precognition). Vision coheres: magic as listening, not domination.</comment>
