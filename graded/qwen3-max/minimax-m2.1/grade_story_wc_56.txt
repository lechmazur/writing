<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motivation—to understand the “architecture of lies”—is consistently embodied through her actions, perception, and micro-choices (e.g., interpreting wear on the sundial, steering toward older brickwork). Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead revealing contradiction through tactile observation and historical intuition. However, the absence of a second character limits relational crucible, and while her endurance is credible, the final renunciation lacks a tangible cost beyond implied effort—keeping it just shy of 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the realization that Konstantýn was himself an architect of deception reweights the entire quest, transforming the legend from recovery to exposure. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density increasing via sensory detail, historical fragments, and the sundial’s recurring presence. Cost is legible in the “serene upheaval” that settles into her bones—a quiet but felt recalibration of purpose. Orientation is immediate and precise, with no disorientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The canal, twilight, and barge are not backdrop but active constraints: the black-glass water reflects both past and present, the amber lamps signal erasure-as-fashion, and the older brickwork beneath repairs becomes a literal guide for navigation. The sundial functions as micro-setting—its gnomon casting a shadow that measures “hours that stretched across decades.” Every sensory detail serves the theme of layered time, and the environment directly shapes the protagonist’s final choice to steer toward hidden history.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering why a river was erased—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist realizes Konstantýn participated in the lie. This tightening reconfigures her goal from discovery to interpretation, narrowing options to forensic reading rather than excavation. Agency is clear: her training instincts drive every pivot, and the cost is conceptual—accepting that truth is constructed, not found. However, the escalation lacks a concrete forfeiture (e.g., time, safety, tool), slightly muting the pressure’s physical stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of object, setting, and motive: truth is not buried but overwritten, and seeking is the only honest act. The final image—the sundial “measuring hours that refused to stay hidden”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence, reflection, and the contrast between luxury lofts and industrial ghosts. No platitudes; wisdom is earned through the tactile logic of brass wear and brick seams.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose carries a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices like a cartographer—attuned to erosion, alignment, and occlusion. Syntax modulates with intensity: longer, fluid sentences in contemplation; tighter clauses during decision (“she steered the barge toward...”). Free indirect style is seamless, and diction remains within the seeker’s lexicon—no register drift. The voice never explains what it shows, trusting the reader to follow the archaeology of implication.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is precise, with high information density: “twilight settle over the canal like a held breath” establishes mood, time, and tension in one image. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with thought, and metaphors cohere (e.g., lies as sediment, silence as static-hush). One minor slip: “thoughtfully clear satisfaction” borders on label-speak, though it’s quickly grounded in physical action. Otherwise, zero loops, scaffold, or overwriting—even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of historical erasure, time-measurement, and epistemic humility feels fresh yet inevitable. The “errant legend seeker” trope is transformed by specificity: her method is tactile historiography, not adventure. The canal-as-palimpsest is rendered without cliché, and the twist—that the mapmaker obscured the truth—subverts treasure-hunt conventions meaningfully. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative, reflective) heightens thematic stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
