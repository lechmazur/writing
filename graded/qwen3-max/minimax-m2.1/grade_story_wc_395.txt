<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s “brightly attentive” trait is embodied through micro-choices (enlarging the patch, tracing numbers) and internal contradiction—she’s both loyal archivist and truth-seeker. Her motivation intensifies credibly from curiosity to moral urgency. The final renunciation (choosing to follow Yuki into silence rather than restore or erase her) is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost: she becomes complicit in the company’s hidden archive. No therapy-speak or diagnostic labels mar her interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Maren doesn’t restore Yuki but commits to tracing where deleted files go, crystallizing options with visible cost—she risks becoming another ghost in the archive. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: pattern density (47s, echoes, constellations) intensifies until the final image reweights everything. Cost is legible in “the silence where the company had hidden what it could not bear to remember.” Orientation is anchored crisply by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The social network archive functions as a charged micro-setting: its humming servers, looping profile melodies, and frozen profiles directly constrain Maren’s actions and shape the final image. The patch—a small object—recurs with evolving meaning, culminating in Maren’s realization that the constellation isn’t a code but a door. Sensory detail (echo of forgotten songs, cold server farm) is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Maren’s professional attention. The setting charges the closure without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus corporate erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Maren learns the Prometheus didn’t crash. The tightening occurs when she realizes the company sent her the case to either recover or permanently bury Yuki’s work. Her agency drives escalation: each number traced is a deliberate act against institutional silence. Cost is unmistakable: she must choose between complicity and becoming a ghost herself, crystallized in the final line’s commitment to “follow the numbers into the silence.”</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: digital residue as haunted space, deletion as distributed consciousness. The final image—Maren entering the silence where deleted files go—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: What happens to truth the powerful wish to erase? It reweights all prior motifs (songs, numbers, patches) without moralizing. Subtext operates through silence, pattern, and absence; no prompt-like articulation mars the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled single third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature: Maren notices patterns others dismiss as static. Voice modulates under pressure—sentences shorten during discovery beats (“She enlarged the image…”), then swell lyrically at the end. Diction stays within plausible lexicon; no register drift. The prose embodies “brightly attentive” rhythmically, with syntactic variety and concrete filters (“noticed how the patch depicted…”) that avoid overuse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language (“digital ghost images,” “echo of forgotten songs”) is consistent and payoff-earned. Minor scaffold in “The recurring numbers began appearing everywhere” slightly flattens momentum, but no paraphrase loops or template cadence mar peak beats. Final paragraph’s rhythm swells effectively, with clear propulsion and zero artifacts in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of digital haunting, corporate secrecy, and deep-space signal ethics feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (vanished scientist, hidden data) are transformed through specific choices: consciousness distributed across servers, truth encoded in song echoes. Risk-taking (accumulative structure, conceptual repricing of deletion) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The vision—memory as active, haunted infrastructure—is singular, coherent, and fully committed.</comment>
