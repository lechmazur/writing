<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ghost-whisperer’s motivation—salvaging purity from wreckage—is vividly embodied through her meticulous dream analysis and shrine tending, not merely stated. Her interiority is concrete: “weaving truth carefully from fragments strangers carried in their dreams” shows method as character. Yet the child’s restoration feels more like a mission than a psychologically fraught reckoning; the protagonist’s personal stakes remain abstract, limiting emotional contradiction. A stronger internal conflict—e.g., doubt about disturbing the dead—would have elevated this to 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the protagonist prepares to expose the truth, crystallizing her purpose with visible cost—the melting snow globe, dissolving secrets, and decades of collective grief. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dream fragments accrue into a portrait, and the glacier’s silence teaches listening. Cost is legible in the final image: “she would give the nameless girl her voice at last,” implying irreversible exposure. Orientation is clear by line 30 (“candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice”), and the drive intensifies without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The glacier shrine functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges every choice: its cold preserves memories, its candles borrow starlight, its walls hold evidence. The snow globe’s melting physically mirrors the thawing of buried truth. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—“glacial air,” “cloudy suspension,” “borrowed starlight”—all filtered through the protagonist’s ritualistic focus. The environment culminates in the dawn-bleeding climax, where blue ice becomes a vessel for revelation, directly shaping the final act.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—naming the lost child—is signaled early and deepens through dream analysis, narrowing options until only exposure remains. The tightening occurs when the photograph emerges from the snow globe, forcing action. Cost is felt: the protagonist risks disrupting dormant grief across coastal towns. However, escalation leans on accumulation rather than active resistance; no external pressure tests her resolve, slightly muting agency under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—memory as fragile, communal testimony—emerges through particulars: dream cameos, melting snow globe, glacial preservation. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: giving voice isn’t recovery but reanchoring, resisting the sea’s erasure. Subtext thrives in silence and borrowed light; no moralizing intrudes. The child’s song, hummed unknowingly by strangers, becomes a motif of involuntary remembrance, reweighting loss as shared inheritance rather than private tragedy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose carries a distinct perceptual signature: lyrical yet precise, with rhythm modulating between meditative (“tended flickering memories like delicate flames”) and urgent (“she had come to expose what the sea had taken”). Syntax varies naturally, avoiding monotony, and diction stays within the ghost-whisperer’s poetic lexicon without register drift. No dialogue simplifies control, and POV remains tightly focalized. The voice earns its lyricism through consistent embodiment, never slipping into abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“wooden bones rose like cathedral ribs from the sand” conveys wreck, reverence, and scale). Figurative language is coherent—ice as sanctuary, dreams as snowfall—and avoids muddle. Minor scaffold in “weaving truth carefully… as one weaves silk” borders on redundant, but propulsion remains strong. Final paragraph’s cadence shift toward resolution (“she would find the living relatives…”) delivers earned momentum without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fusion of ghost-whispering with dream archaeology and glacial preservation—a fresh take on posthumous justice. The wreck-diver’s role transforms salvage into ethical witness, and the snow globe as time capsule subverts nostalgia. Risk-taking (lyric structure, no dialogue, passive protagonist) heightens thematic weight without sacrificing clarity. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight: collective dreaming as involuntary archive, glacier as silent collaborator.</comment>
