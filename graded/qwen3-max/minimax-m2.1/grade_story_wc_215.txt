<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her “tranquilly perceptive” stance shapes her actions without sentimentality. Her final acceptance of the covenant feels earned through embodied stillness, not epiphany. The ghost’s recognition mirrors Mira’s own unspoken grief, deepening motivation without exposition. However, the lack of active contradiction in her impulses (observation vs. participation remains theoretical) prevents full 9+ integration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mira accepts guardianship of silence, foreclosing retreat into pure observation. The cost—bearing “crushing weight” while holding “impossible lightness”—is legible in the final image. Structure follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density builds until the stained glass box crystallizes meaning. Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The abandoned apiary functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges every choice—ash, comb, glass, and soil all shape perception and action. Light through broken glass recurs with evolving emotional valence, culminating in the amber-rose glow that summons the ghost. The wasteland’s contrast intensifies the sanctuary’s fragility. Final image ties setting directly to thematic closure: the oasis is dead, but meaning persists within its boundaries.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving unspoken covenants—is signaled early and deepens when the ghost gestures toward the buried box. Mira’s agency lies in attention and acceptance, not action; her choice to dig and receive fulfills the covenant with visible cost. Pressure escalates texturally, not causally, consistent with the Accumulative lens. No false resolution: the ghost fades only after Mira assumes responsibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from bees, silence, and stewardship—never stated outright. The stained glass box reweights earlier images of fracture and ash, transforming loss into custodianship. Subtext thrives in gesture: the ghost’s hands, Mira’s digging, the lap-cradled box. Final line—“Unspoken words had found their keeper at last”—resonates without moralizing, offering a non-literal answer to the story’s central question: Can silence be preserved?</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled, filtered through Mira’s “tranquilly perceptive” lens. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity: longer, lyrical sentences during observation; shorter, grounded phrasing during the dig. Diction (“docile creature,” “moth wings against a summer lamp”) is voice-specific and consistent. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains singular and vivid throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line efficiency. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light, glass, weight) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in “bodies formed from fragments of gold and amber and something that might have been honey itself”—slightly strained—but doesn’t obscure meaning. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm supports thematic accumulation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic and ghost tropes through specificity: beekeeping as sacred covenant, silence as inheritance. The fusion of ecological ruin, spectral memory, and mute devotion feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final image—a recluse cradling stained glass in ash—feels both singular and archetypal, avoiding derivative safety.</comment>
