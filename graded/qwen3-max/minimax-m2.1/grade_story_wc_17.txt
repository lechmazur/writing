<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “sensitively perceptive eye,” the “crackle of centuries in her fingers”—and her micro-choices (retrieving diaries, using negatives) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on preservation over personal safety. Her motivation stems from inherited duty, not abstraction, and her final act of sketching amid ivy rustle shows credible endurance with emotional cost. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile perception and professional ritual. Her contradiction—loneliness versus communion with ghosts—is active in scene, not summarized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure intensifies through layered sensory detail and deepening resonance, culminating in Charged Poise—Mira sketching as the walls “dream aloud.” Cost is legible in the cold corridors, breath clouding, and the weight of unremembered names. Orientation anchors (“university before the floods,” “Mira,” “eastern wing”) are clear by line 30. The closure reconfigures legacy from burden to thread, with conceptual cost borne in solitude now transformed into shared witness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passages, ash-filled fireplace, and damp granite halls aren’t backdrop—they constrain Mira’s movements, supply the half-burned diaries, and charge the final image where ivy “rustles like audience members.” Sensory detail is filtered through Mira’s cartographer POV: she notices worn stones that “remember footsteps,” not generic ruin. The setting evolves—from encroaching green to intimate office—and directly enables the climax via rain-quenched papers. The brass lenses and leather charts tie occupation to environment with lived-in specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving what walls dream—is signaled early and tightens when Mira chooses to interpret Ashworth’s blurred text despite decay and cold. The meaningful deepening occurs when she discovers his echo chart, transforming her task from recovery to continuation. Cost is felt in physical chill and emotional isolation, though the escalation leans more on revelation than tactical narrowing. Still, under Accumulative lens, the cadence shift toward communal dreaming reweights stakes with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the half-burned diaries, the negative strip, the whispering walls—not through assertion. The central question (“what do walls dream about?”) receives a non-literal answer: they dream of their people, and memory persists through those who listen. Subtext operates in silence (ivy rustling), gesture (kneeling to retrieve pages), and tool use. The ending reweights legacy as continuity, not burden, with resonant ambiguity—no moralizing, only charged poise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person limited POV is stable and deeply character-specific: Mira’s perceptual signature notices “worn stones that remembered footsteps” and “ink bled and blurred in the heat.” Syntax modulates with pressure—longer descriptive sentences early, tighter clauses during diary work. Voice remains consistent, with diction rooted in cartographic and archival lexicon (“residual whispers,” “echo chart”). No head-hopping; focalization stays tightly bound to Mira’s knowledge and sensation throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: “leaves pressing against shattered windows like curious animals” does setting, metaphor, and atmosphere in one. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor flaw: slight overuse of figurative language in high-pressure beats (“building dreamed,” “walls whispered,” “ivies rustling like audience”) risks density overload, but pattern is taught early and pays off at closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; every line advances character, theme, or atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The corridor echo cartographer is a fresh synthesis of climate fiction and archival haunting—specific, irreplaceable, and grounded in tactile ritual. Tropes of post-collapse memory are transformed through occupational detail (brass lenses, film negatives) and emotional specificity (grandmother’s “weight of a thousand unremembered names”). The core concept avoids abstraction by tying legacy to physical acts of listening and mapping. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; vision feels singular and fully committed.</comment>
