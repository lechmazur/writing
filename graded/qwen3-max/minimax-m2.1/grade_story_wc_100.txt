<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aldric’s interiority is richly embodied—his ache behind the ribs, his stubborn adherence to old embalming methods, and his weary competence feel specific and lived-in. His contradictory impulses (withdrawal vs. duty) act simultaneously when he accepts the souls’ call. The final choice—to wait by the window with renewed purpose—is earned through his prior isolation and professional ethos. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile detail and micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Aldric’s shift from fatigue to readiness is crystallized in the final image of him waiting with fresh coffee, holding the restored lens. Cost is legible—the cold coffee, the vanished package, the years of solitude now exchanged for ongoing duty. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds via sensory density (salt-smelling sand, underwater library) and cadence shifts that reweight his stake in giving rest. Orientation is clear by line 30; disorientation serves closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse lens functions as micro-setting—it constrains Aldric’s choices (handling sharp glass, listening to foghorn echoes) and charges the final image (glowing softly, signaling future calls). Pemberton Street and the underwater library are vivid but purpose-driven: bookshelves as ribs, gray-green light, waist-deep water all reflect his liminal profession. Sensory hierarchy aligns with his undertaker’s attention—smell of salt, texture of sand, sound of bubbling words. The environment actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—giving permanent address to lost souls—is signaled early via the lens and deepens when Aldric enters the underwater library. Escalation is driven by his agency: choosing to listen, sit in the throne-chair, and help each soul release regrets. Cost is unmistakable: his lifelong ache fades only through labor that demands emotional vulnerability. Coincidence (the package) complicates but doesn’t resolve—he earns the lens’s restoration through work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: rest requires witness, not ritual. The lighthouse lens reweights from broken artifact to active signal, answering the central question—how do the unrecovered dead find peace?—without moralizing. Subtext operates through silence (Aldric’s unspoken grief) and image (books preserved by curse/miracle mirroring souls suspended between states). Final image offers non-literal resolution: stillness found not in withdrawal but in readiness to serve.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Aldric’s perceptual signature—his notice of hands, coffins, and bodies over decor. Voice modulates with pressure: short sentences during discovery (“No return address”), lyrical flow underwater. Syntax reflects his mind—measured, precise, yet poetic under stress (“words bubble-doubled around him”). No head-hopping; diction stays within his undertaker’s lexicon without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: “sand that smelled of salt despite coming from nowhere near the coast” does setting, mystery, and character in one. Sentence rhythm varies effectively—longer underwater, clipped at threshold moments. Minor artifact: “translucent and confused” slightly leans on stock phrasing, but no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent (lens knitting together like healing bone), never muddled in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: an undertaker aiding drowned souls via a broken lighthouse lens transforms gothic tropes into emotionally specific myth. The underwater library as purgatory feels inevitable in hindsight—books swollen like bodies, light filtering like hope. Risk-taking (non-causal logic, impossible spaces) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Conceptual integrity holds: every element serves the core idea that rest requires being heard.</comment>
