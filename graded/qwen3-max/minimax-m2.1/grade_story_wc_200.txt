<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation—rooted in personal loss and a belief that joy heals even in parting—is embodied through micro-choices (researching the soldier’s past, adjusting the harp) and consistent interiority. Her “modest fearlessness” isn’t bravado but exhaustion, credibly shaping her actions. The soldier’s arc is secondary but serves as a crucible for Mira’s enduring stance, not a tidy redemption. No diagnostic label-speak; grief and hope are rendered through sensory detail and action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the soldier disperses not through absolution but laughter, reweighting shame with joy. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens through layered sound, light, and memory—and the final image (“luminous morning”) crystallizes Mira’s Charged Poise: she continues, wounded but unwavering. Cost is legible in her “familiar ache,” and the gorge’s acoustics function as both setting and causal constraint. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Echo Gorge isn’t backdrop—it actively shapes the plot: its acoustics amplify unfinished business, enabling spectral confessions. The crocodile tooth, harp, and sunrise are micro-settings that constrain choice (e.g., tuning with the tooth, playing at dawn). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: amber light “bled,” notes “split into three,” laughter “made of tears.” The environment charges the final image—sunlight as “luminous ache”—tying setting to theme and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—helping souls laugh before release—is signaled early and deepens when Mira chooses absurdity over solemnity. Pressure escalates texturally: mist → confession → music → laughter. The tightening occurs when she sings the milk-from-nose anecdote, narrowing options from ritual to intimate storytelling. Cost is felt in Mira’s unhealed wound, though the escalation leans more on atmosphere than protagonist-driven causality, slightly limiting agency under a strict Causal lens—but fits Accumulative mode.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: healing requires integrating joy into grief, not replacing it. Subtext lives in the soldier’s smile and Mira’s continued work—no moralizing. The final image reweights the premise: laughter isn’t denial but reconfiguration. Ambiguity lingers (will she ever heal?), but the core insight—that wholeness holds contradiction—is earned through concrete particulars, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to sound, light, and absence. Syntax modulates with pressure—longer, fluid sentences in description; fragmented urgency in climax (“He had been afraid… selfish…”). No head-hopping; single POV maintained. Diction stays within Mira’s lexicon—no register drift. Elision is purposeful (backstory woven via present action), and the lyric mode is taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies naturally; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in “music made of tears” risks purple prose, but it’s earned by context. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks. One near-redundancy (“broken and strange” / “discordant”) but not enough to trigger penalty. Closure beat remains clear and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms the “ghost whisperer” trope through specificity: grief as water through stone, healing via absurdity, tools with acoustic magic. The synthesis of crocodile tooth, misaligned harp, and echo gorge feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk in making laughter—not forgiveness—the key to release, heightening emotional stakes without gimmickry. Voice, concept, and setting cohere into a singular vision rarely seen in short form.</comment>
