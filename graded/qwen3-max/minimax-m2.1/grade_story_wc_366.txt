<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maren’s reticence and warmth are embodied in precise, consistent choices—her silence isn’t passivity but a mode of witnessing. Her stacking of stones is a micro-choice that crystallizes her inherited duty, foreclosing escape with visible cost: she carries the sea’s grief in her pocket. The grandmother’s backstory is anchored in the sea glass and tilts Maren’s present action without over-explaining. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in tactile detail (“stones were warmer here, almost feverish”).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Maren’s ritual stack reactivates the lamp not by magic but by bearing witness, fulfilling the lighthouse’s demand for acknowledgment. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the stone stacks, letters, and sea glass accrue meaning until the final image reweights everything. Cost is legible: “pockets were heavier with meaning than they had ever been with cargo.” Orientation is clear by line 2; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lantern room functions as micro-setting: its residual heat, fossilized letters, and spatial choreography (spiral stairs, dock) directly constrain Maren’s choices and charge the climax. The sea glass pressed to the lamp housing merges personal and environmental stakes. Sensory hierarchy reflects Maren’s profession—she notices barnacles, gull calls, currents—not tourist details. The setting is never static; it breathes, mourns, and demands response.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—acknowledging the drowned—is signaled early via the dark lamp and Ashford’s refusal to leave. Pressure escalates through accumulating stone stacks, culminating in Maren’s decisive act. The tightening is meaningful: each new stack narrows options until only ritual remains. Cost is felt—she inherits her grandmother’s unfinished business—but the escalation leans slightly on revelation over active resistance, hence just below 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the interplay of memory, witness, and liminal space—no moralizing. The sea glass and stone stacks shift from objects to vessels of obligation, culminating in a non-literal answer: safety is not prevention but remembrance. Subtext thrives in silence and ritual; the lighthouse’s “mourning” reframes guidance as accountability. Final image reweights the entire premise: light returns not because danger passes, but because grief is honored.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: Maren notices what a skipper would—currents, barnacles, provisioning logistics—and filters the supernatural through maritime pragmatism. Syntax modulates with pressure: shorter sentences during stone discovery, lyrical flow in reflection. No head-hopping; Ashford’s dialogue is sparse but distinct. Voice remains consistent even in elevated moments (“luminescent ache”) because diction stays rooted in Maren’s tactile worldview.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “fog bank that rolled in like a breathing thing” conveys atmosphere, character, and threat). Minor figurative density in the climax (“ghost of the great lamp’s heat,” “fossilized prayers”) borders on overwriting but serves the Accumulative lens. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot, character, or mood. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors resolution—steady, weighted, luminous.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms the haunted lighthouse trope through specificity: the anonymous letter chain via stone stacks is fresh, grounded in keeper lore, not ghost cliché. Emotional truth outweighs novelty—Maren’s quiet endurance feels earned, not symbolic. The synthesis of maritime tradition, generational grief, and ritual communication feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric structure, passive protagonist) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
