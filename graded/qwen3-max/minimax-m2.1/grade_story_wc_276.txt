<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Morwen’s cool-headedness is embodied through micro-choices—bare feet on humming ground, zigzag movement, voicing silence—that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. His internal contradiction (grief vs. hope) manifests physically via the rail spike’s changing weight, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. The final renunciation—carrying the goddess’s echo in iron rather than restoring her—is earned by his lifelong mastery of stillness. Cost is visible: he remains alone on the coast, fishing for echoes only he can hear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Morwen endures and receives rather than seizes, foreclosing the path of grasping others took, with clear cost (isolation, silent burden). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through sensory layering (sound-as-light, emotion-as-weight), culminating in a cadence shift at “the absence of every sound that had ever hurt him.” Constellations’ broken patterns reconfigure post-resolution, proving change. Every beat tightens toward the garden’s heart; no causality breaks or retroactive patches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sound wave garden functions as micro-setting: its spires constrain Morwen’s movement (zigzag path), emit visible ripples that respond to inner silence, and vanish post-closure—proving environmental agency. The rail spike (tool-as-setting) charges the final image, growing luminous upon receiving the echo. Sensory hierarchy reflects crisis: early focus on visual hum gives way to tactile/emotional resonance (“spike grew warm,” “weight lifted”). No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography (rocky coast → garden → heart) tracks cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—catching the goddess’s echo without scattering it—is signaled early and escalates via Morwen’s agency: his silence slows waves, his movement creates resonance, his voiced silence completes the refrain. Cost is unmistakable: others fail by shouting; Morwen succeeds by sacrificing noise, bearing eternal solitude. The tightening choice—voicing silence—narrows options (no tools, no boat, only spike and stillness). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; coincidence never resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: silence as active receptivity, grief transmuted into vessel. Final image—Morwen fishing for inaudible echoes—offers non-literal answer to “how to hold what’s lost?” without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture (spike’s weight shifts) and image (sleepwalking constellations settling). Complexity resists binaries: the echo isn’t restored but housed; loss isn’t healed but carried. No thematic echo or sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Morwen notices vibrations as light, emotions as metal-weight, silence as tangible absence. Rhythmic control peaks during climax—short clauses (“He would have to voice silence itself”) accelerate into lyrical cadence (“a grief that was also a bell”). POV modesty maintained: no head-hopping; knowledge bound to sensory input (garden “whispered” via wave-language). Compression taught early (“hummed with visible vibrations”) pays off in closure’s luminous spike.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density: “rail spike grew warm against his thigh” conveys object, embodiment, and foreshadowing in seven words. Figurative coherence—sound/light/emotion synesthesia—never muddles causality. Minor overwriting in “feral lullaby sung by wild things who had forgotten why they sang” slightly strains metaphor but doesn’t obscure closure. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“It stood,” “Morwen approached,” “The first night”).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise transforms mythic tropes through specificity: fisher’s occupational stillness meets cosmic rupture. Sleepwalking constellations aren’t backdrop but active pressure—patterns breaking *sings*, altering tactics. Risk-taking (voicing silence as action) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Synthesis feels inevitable: only a cool-headed fisher could catch an echo by unmaking sound. No derivative echoes; authenticity in iron spike’s emotional transliteration.</comment>
