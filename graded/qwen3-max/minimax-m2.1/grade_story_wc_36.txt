<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kira’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied—her trembling hands, deliberate steps, and silent regret feel earned, not diagnostic. Her flaw (paralyzing fear) directly caused Oresta’s fall, and her renunciation of interventionist guardianship reads as credible endurance with visible cost. However, the final insight (“some guardians were meant to witness”) edges toward articulation rather than dramatization, slightly undercutting the “no therapy-speak” standard in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Kira accepts witnessing over acting, foreclosing her prior path with the cost of permanent exile from active guardianship. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story deepens through layered echoes, driftwood markers, and flute silence—and the canyon setting functions as both crucible and constraint. Cost is legible in her changed posture toward the relic and the unplayed flute at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The Thunder-echo range isn’t backdrop—it actively shapes tactics (silence enforced by geography), constrains communication, and charges the final image via reverberation as metaphor for memory. The gilded reed flute and driftwood function as micro-settings that anchor choice: arranging markers is an act of order amid chaos, and the flute’s unplayed presence reweights its meaning. Sensory detail is selective, tactile, and POV-filtered without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming purpose after failure—is signaled early and tightens at Listener’s Crossing, where Kira confronts her three-heartbeat paralysis. The meaningful deepening comes through her shift from guilt-driven penance to conceptual repricing of guardianship. Cost is felt (exile, silence, burden of memory), though escalation relies more on reflection than external pressure; still, under an Accumulative lens, the cadence shift and density increase suffice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: true guardianship lies in humble attention, not control. This reframing avoids moralizing—it’s earned through Kira’s failed action, her grandmother’s legacy, and the flute’s silent witness. The final constellation-shaped driftwood reweights earlier markers from mere navigation aids into acts of faith, offering a non-literal answer to the central question without stating it outright.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, rhythmic, and perceptually specific—Kira notices dust motes like “suspended worlds,” thunder as “giants conversing,” and selects driftwood with archival care. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity (longer, flowing sentences in reflection; clipped beats in movement). No head-hopping, consistent psychic distance, and the elevated diction feels voice-motivated, not imposed. The prose *is* Kira’s mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual rhythm, and figurative language is coherent (e.g., “avalanchingly quiet,” “echo-heavy passages”). Minor overwriting in “dust motes that floated... like tiny suspended worlds” borders on ornamental, but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms the “fallen guardian” trope through specificity: the Weaving, Voicekeepers, and Thunder-echo acoustics create a world that feels lived-in, not templated. The risk—centering silence, stillness, and non-action as climax—pays off because it’s grounded in Kira’s flaw and the setting’s logic. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet fresh, with no safety hedging.</comment>
