<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is exquisitely concrete—her noticing is not just trait but method, embodied in micro-choices like handling the coffee cup “as if sanctified.” Her contradiction (craving connection yet trained in solitude) operates simultaneously in scene. The final realization feels earned through accumulated perception, not epiphany. Flawless integration of inherited sensitivity as both gift and burden.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the house isn’t haunted but *alive* through memory, reweighting the entire premise. Cost is legible in Mira’s relinquishment of rational skepticism—she accepts a truth that demands lifelong attentiveness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: each displaced object tightens the pattern until the orris shard pulses with meaning. No causality breaks; every beat feeds the final blaze of recognition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The bay setting functions as micro-setting: sea lavender, salt-worn clapboard, and violet hour aren’t backdrop but active filters shaping Mira’s perception. The orris root shard—charged object-as-setting—constrains her choices (she pockets it instinctively) and directly charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects her profession: scent over sight, residue over spectacle. Environment and body cohere as instruments of knowing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding why houses feel alive—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s agency: she *chooses* to read displacements as communication. The tightening occurs when the shard grows warm, forcing her to accept non-rational knowledge. Cost is felt in the quiet surrender of empirical certainty for ancestral attunement. Pressure escalates texturally, not causally, fitting the lens without slack.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through particulars: the orris shard, tilted photos, sticky cup residue. No moralizing—only the resonant final image of “a hush of understanding that some truths have always been waiting to be noticed.” Subtext thrives in silence: inheritance as embodied attention, not doctrine. The central question (“why houses feel alive”) is answered non-literally through Mira’s sensory communion, reweighting all prior details.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: Mira notices “the spaces between things,” and prose mirrors this with syntactic precision (“a photograph tilted a half-degree further east”). Rhythm modulates from lyrical observation to crystalline realization without register drift. Zero head-hopping; focalization stays tightly bound to her creeping normality. Voice feels inevitable—a fusion of grandmother’s perfumer’s lexicon and Mira’s forensic tenderness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the shard of hush that she carries is not silence but something like its opposite” exemplifies high information density. No loops or scaffold—every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is consistent (light as consciousness, scent as memory) and never muddles closure. Minor deduction only for one slightly over-modified phrase (“violet ghost”), but clarity remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms the “haunted house” trope into a meditation on memory-as-presence, grounded in the specific craft of perfumery. Originality lies in the methodology: haunting as displaced objects, not specters. The “hushed blaze” tone is riskily sustained yet never gimmicky. Every detail (orris root, sea lavender) feels irreplaceable—this story couldn’t exist in another setting or with another protagonist.</comment>
