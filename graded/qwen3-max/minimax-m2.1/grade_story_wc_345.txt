<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is consistent and compelling, though her agency remains spectral rather than active; Eli and Lena show credible micro-choices that reveal shifting values (e.g., Lena’s hoarding to giving). The ensemble cast avoids stereotyping through specific actions—Eli teaching from databases, Lena’s resource shift—but interiority is diffused across the group, limiting deep individual contradiction. Final renunciation of isolation is earned by prior communal labor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the community chooses collective care over survivalist isolation, with visible cost in labor and vulnerability. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—chalk messages, arches, garden restoration build density until the bell’s ring crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible in “sweated and laughed and argued” and the rain as blessing. Orientation anchors are clear by line 30.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The orchard planet’s floating arches and silver-leafed trees aren’t backdrop—they lean closer as pressure builds, directly shaping spatial choreography. The bell tower and butterfly garden function as micro-settings that constrain choices: restoration requires specific labor, paths are “cracked but passable.” Final image of wings unfurling in gentle rain charges the setting with thematic weight. Every detail serves pressure or closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming neglected communal care—is signaled early via Mira’s messages and deepens through restoration labor. Escalation is driven by collective agency: ignoring messages → gathering → clearing beds → ringing bell. Cost is felt in physical exertion and emotional risk (Lena’s trust). Coincidence (butterflies emerging) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the decisive act is Eli’s intentional ring.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of chosen family emerging through stewardship arises implicitly from action—not stated. The bell’s summoning of rain reweights the premise: survival isn’t just harvesting but tending what was forgotten. Final image of wings unfurling answers the central question—what have we overlooked?—without moralizing. Complexity remains: Mira’s origin unexplained, focus stays on human response.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person plural “they” functions as stable collective POV with consistent perceptual signature (“gnarled trunk,” “silver-leafed canopy”). Voice modulates rhythmically: longer sentences for description, shorter during labor (“carrying water… clearing dead growth”). No head-hopping; focalization stays anchored in communal experience. Diction (“nebula of respite,” “brass bell tarnished green”) reflects shared reverence without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose shows high information density: “floating rock arches drifted like stone clouds” establishes setting, tone, and motif in one image. Minor scaffold in “had watched them arrive… had watched them merge” (two adjacent past-perfect clauses), but no loops or redundancy. Figurative language is coherent—mists, shadows, wings all tie to core motifs. Final paragraph’s cadence (“strangers no longer, family by choice”) avoids sentimentality through concrete action (ringing bell, rain).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms “ghost guide” trope through ecological specificity: Mira’s chalk messages and bell mechanics feel native to this world. Floating arches aren’t decorative—they’re causal (casting shadows that merge during labor). Risk-taking in quiet climax (no dialogue, just a bell ring) heightens stakes by making faith tactile. The synthesis of orchard, ghost, and bell feels inevitable yet fresh; removing any element collapses the logic.</comment>
