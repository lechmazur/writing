<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her shame over the nobleman’s son coexists with quiet pride in having taught him sacrifice’s true cost. Her micro-choices (avoiding the labyrinth, then decoding the tapestry) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over reputation, instruction over obedience. The fidgeting hands motif embodies her restless intellect without veering into diagnostic self-awareness. Her final stillness feels earned because it emerges from active winnowing, not passive acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mira forgives herself by reinterpreting her “failure” through the tapestry’s hidden truth, foreclosing exile’s internal prison with visible emotional cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via frayed threads, thunder’s cadence, frozen villagers—culminating in a Charged Poise where rain and movement resume but her stance is crystallized. Cost is legible in the line: “her hands finally still, her mind quiet in a way it had not been since the trial.” Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph two.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The time-frozen village isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures Mira’s choice to decode the tapestry during the lull, knowing movement may resume imminently. The platinum labyrinth constrains her psychologically (avoidance → confrontation) and charges the final image by reflecting the darkening sky as she achieves clarity. Sensory detail is selective: breath curls, frozen leaves that “never decompose,” thunder’s “sacred” lull—all filtered through her exiled tutor’s perception. The tapestry’s “woven hush” absorbs sound, making its discovery tactilely specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness versus court-imposed shame—is signaled early and tightens when Mira chooses to engage the tapestry despite her avoidance patterns. The deepening occurs as each decoded thread reweights her past: what was negligence becomes pedagogical courage. Agency drives escalation; thunder’s return forces urgency, but the cost (enduring decades of misjudgment) is paid in her quiet realization, not external luck. Coincidence (finding the tapestry) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the winnowing is hers alone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: chess sacrifice as metaphor for moral instruction, the tapestry’s frayed border revealing hidden truth beneath public narrative. Subtext operates in silence—the frozen villagers’ suspended games mirror Mira’s own halted life—and in the labyrinth’s reflective surfaces that literalize introspection. The ending offers a non-literal answer: forgiveness isn’t absolution but reconfiguration of failure into fidelity. No moralizing; resonance arises from the folded tapestry under her arm, a quiet emblem of reclaimed agency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, with perceptual signature evident in how Mira notices strategic details (tapestry threads as “whispered questions,” labyrinth capturing “light from sources that no longer existed”). Syntax modulates with pressure: longer, lyrical sentences during reflection; shorter clauses as thunder returns (“The lull was ending”). Voice remains consistent—no head-hopping, no register drift into abstraction. The final line’s “fierce repose” crystallizes tone without violating interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “breath rising in delicate curls despite the stillness that hung over everything like a suspended spell” establishes rhythm without overwriting. Figurative language is coherent (amber of stopped time, thunder holding its breath) and purposeful. Minor scaffold in “always twisting, always arranging, always finding” slightly flattens immediacy, but this is offset by strong verbs (“winnowed,” “decoding,” “foreclose”). Final paragraph’s cadence shifts effectively to stillness without slackening momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms exile-and-redemption trope through specific stakes: a chess tutor’s professional ethics reframed as moral courage. The frozen village isn’t generic—it’s tied to thunder’s “lull,” making time suspension feel mythically precise. Risk-taking (Accumulative/Textural design with minimal dialogue) heightens thematic weight without gimmickry. The synthesis of game theory, textile craft, and temporal stasis feels inevitable in hindsight, anchored by Mira’s irreplaceable expertise.</comment>
