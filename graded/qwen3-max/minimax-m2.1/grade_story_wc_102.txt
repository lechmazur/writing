<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mei’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, salt-tongued grief, and breath-driven perception ground her motivation in sensory truth. Her contradiction (seeking healing while bearing inherited sorrow) operates simultaneously, not sequentially. The final choice—to translate unused love through the camera obscura—is earned by her established identity as a “pilgrim of sparks.” Minor deduction: the past-life memory arrives with near-instantaneous emotional transfer, slightly compressing the struggle between disbelief and acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mei’s act transforms unused love into released luminescence, with cost legible in her altered breath and the viaduct’s exhalation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via wisteria, fireflies, tear warmth, and breathing shifts until the final cadence shift crystallizes meaning. Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty. Cost is felt: she endures profound grief to enable release, foreclosing passive witnessing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The twilight viaduct isn’t backdrop but active micro-setting: its stones trap love-tendrils, its arch frames the apparatus, and its exhale confirms healing. Wisteria scent, firefly rise, and mountain mist aren’t decorative—they modulate perception and pressure Mei’s breath rhythm. The camera obscura and Kwan Yin’s tear function as tool and object-setting, constraining her method and charging the final image. Every detail serves the Accumulative lens without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—releasing unused love—is signaled early and deepens when Mei’s breath reveals the tendrils. Her agency drives escalation: positioning the apparatus, offering the tear, and syncing breath to mourning/acceptance. Cost is unmistakable: she metabolizes ancestral grief, altering her own physiology (“breathing catching like a phrase she could not finish”). The tightening forecloses mere observation, demanding sacrificial translation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: love unspent doesn’t vanish but lingers in place, requiring witness to transform. The final image—tendrils flowing through the photograph back into the world—answers the central question non-literally: healing is not erasure but rechanneling. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity remains (Who loved? Who was lost?), yet resonance is undeniable. Recurrence of breath, light, and tears accumulates pressure without tokenism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Mei’s spiritually curious perception—she “asks questions of shadows,” notices light’s “quality,” interprets scent and breath as data. Voice modulates under pressure: lyrical in description (“twilight settled like a held breath”), taut in climax (“breathing began to change—becoming shallower, then deeper…”). No head-hopping; diction stays within her poetic but grounded lexicon. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors healing cadence without artifice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: “grief so profound it left a signature of salt on her tongue” merges taste, emotion, and metaphor cleanly. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with scene intensity. Minor overwriting in “liquid pearl into waiting palms”—slightly ornamental—but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Closure image (“unused love found its way home”) avoids sentimentality through concrete verbs (“flowing,” “transforming”).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: camera obscura as spiritual medium for residual emotion, not image. The “pilgrim of sparks” conceit transforms reincarnation tropes into tactile work—gathering luminous fragments between lives. Risk-taking (breath as detector, viaduct as emotional capacitor) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors universals: Hong Kong antique shop, saffron robes, Kyoto garden root the metaphysical in lived detail. No derivative echoes; vision feels singular and inevitable.</comment>
