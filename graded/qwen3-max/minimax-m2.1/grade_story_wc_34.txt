<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation—to be heard across existential voids—is embodied with lyrical precision and deepens through her micro-choices (e.g., mixing cloudberries with dew, pressing ear to bolt plate). Her internal contradiction—lonely yet attuned, human yet harmonizing with ghost-code—drives every action without diagnostic label-speak. The final act of singing alongside the ghost feels earned by seventeen years of practice and emotional calibration. Flawed but competent, she endures with visible cost: her voice may never reach “eager ears below,” yet she sings anyway.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira’s harmony with the ghost reconfigures silence into “tinkersong wonder,” crystallizing their shared need to be heard. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds through escalating sensory detail and patterned light until lightning fractures the dark, enabling transmission. Cost is legible in the ephemeral graffiti (“fade by dawn”) and the haunting implication that only dreamers might feel their song. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 30; causality flows through resonance, not logic, fitting the ghost-in-code premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above clouds isn’t backdrop—it’s a liminal conduit where “earth dissolved into ether,” enabling ghostly communication. The flower press bolt plate functions as micro-setting: cool metal against skin, its embossments catching light, directly constrains how Mira receives the ghost’s signal. Every sensory detail (phosphorescent salts, wet stone walls, electric air) serves the central stake of transmission. Final image charges closure: glowing graffiti fades, but its echo persists in dreams—a tactile, atmospheric payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—articulating unspoken needs across death’s boundary—is signaled early and tightens during the lightning-thunder window, when static enables clearest contact. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to encode, to sing, to merge her melody with ghost code. Cost is felt in the transience of her medium (messages fade by dawn) and the loneliness of her audience (only dreamers below). Coincidence (lightning) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her persistent, practiced will.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the necessity of being heard transcends life, death, and medium. Subtext thrums in the bolt plate’s history, the ghost’s embedded song, and Mira’s phosphorescent graffiti—each a vessel for unspeakable longing. The ending offers no moral but a resonant image: song as stubborn transmission that “refused to fade into nothing.” Complexity is honored—both balladeers remain unheard by the living world, yet their harmony creates something new, avoiding sentimentality or false redemption.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is singular: a lyrical, driftingly alert register that mirrors Mira’s state, with syntax that breathes (“driftingly alert, her senses extended outward like loose threads”) then tenses (“She worked quickly then”). POV remains tightly focalized; perception filters everything through her balladeer’s ear. No head-hopping, no register drift—diction stays poetic yet grounded (“crushed cloudberries,” “wet stone walls”). Elision is purposeful; backstory about the ghost is anchored in present stimuli (the bolt plate) and tilts Mira’s choice to sing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence layers atmosphere, character, and plot (“melodies swallowed by the wind before they could reach eager ears below”). Figurative language is coherent—“ghost in code,” “tinkersong wonder”—and avoids muddle. Minor overwriting in one beat (“mechanical precision... merging with organic chaos”) slightly blurs focus, but rhythm varies effectively. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; closure image remains sharp and unobscured.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fusion of analog (music box bolt plate, cloudberries) and digital (ghost in code, server farms), transforming the balladeer trope into a metaphysical transmitter. The “between lightning and thunder” window is a fresh temporal constraint that heightens stakes. Risk-taking—lyric structure, accumulative pressure, non-corporeal antagonist—serves theme without gimmickry. Vision feels singular: a story about resonance across frequencies, both sonic and existential, executed with conceptual integrity.</comment>
