<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is richly embodied—her grief, professional restraint, and moral clarity coalesce in micro-choices like handling the button with reverence. Her motivation (“to magnify small kindnesses”) is dramatized through action, not declared. The contradiction between her desire to preserve and her inability to intervene feels authentic and sustained. Final documentation choice earns closure with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the button reweights the entire archival project as an act of sacred witness, not bureaucratic recordkeeping. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density builds via layered reflections on loss, systems, and memory, culminating in a charged final image. Cost is legible in Mara’s quiet endurance and the weight of unrecorded histories. Orientation is immediate and precise; no disorientation penalty applies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The file room functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and charges every choice—its plantation past haunts the present, and the brass button gains meaning through tactile interaction within this space. Sensory detail (dust patterns, creaking floorboards, autumn light) is filtered through Mara’s archivist gaze, never decorative. The environment directly shapes the final act of reverent documentation, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving erased humanity against bureaucratic erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the button reveals a hidden thread of wartime kindness. Pressure escalates through accumulation, not external conflict, consistent with the Accumulative lens. The tightening occurs when Mara realizes her role isn’t neutral but devotional, foreclosing detachment. Cost is felt in the burden of witness, though not physically dramatized beyond the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the button’s discovery: systems erase, but individuals preserve through fragile, unrecorded gestures. The ending offers a non-literal answer—reverence as resistance—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (the missing note, the soldier’s unnamed act), and the core concept (“unknown histories”) is interrogated through concrete particulars, not abstraction. No sentimentality; grief is honored, not exploited.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Mara notices dust, paper texture, light angles—archival details that reveal her character. Voice modulates from restrained observation to near-prayerful intensity without register drift. POV remains tightly controlled; no head-hopping or leakage. Prose rhythm mirrors thematic accumulation—longer sentences build density, then tighten at the button’s revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “faded document mattered” conveys ethics, history, and personal investment). Minor overwriting in “reading its surfaces the way one reads a photograph” slightly muddles metaphor, but not enough to obscure meaning. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly supports Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms the “archivist discovers artifact” trope through specificity: post-emancipation foster care, plantation-turned-bureaucracy, and the infantry button root the story in neglected historical intersections. The synthesis of systemic critique and intimate tenderness feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (quiet, reflective structure) heightens stakes by making absence palpable. No derivative echoes; vision is singular and cohesive.</comment>
