<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cosmic janitor’s motivation—rooted in spiritual curiosity and empathy—is consistent and embodied through ritualistic gestures, not abstract declarations. Their internal conflict (between witnessing and intervening) manifests in micro-choices: kneeling instead of rushing, tracing rather than collecting. The final act of carrying the fragment to the recycling chamber enacts Earned Stasis—renouncing spectacle for quiet stewardship—with visible cost: the burden of bearing others’ endings. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through tactile reverence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the janitor’s stance crystallizes in the final image of “gentle hands” holding cosmic detritus as both death and seed, with conceptual cost—the overlooked era’s hush deepens precisely because their work remains unseen. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through refracted rainbows, amber pulses, and repeated tracing until the final beat reweights “vulnerability” as strength. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks. Cost is legible in the star’s “naked exposure of no longer being what one once was.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The yellow lantern glass functions as micro-setting: its amber surface constrains how light is read, and its inherited weight charges the final act. The station’s “hollow between celestial currents” isn’t backdrop—it enables the core action (stars rest here) and mirrors the janitor’s liminal role. Sensory detail is selective (amber pulse, warm water stillness) and filtered through the janitor’s reverence. The recurring object directly shapes the closure: without the glass, no refraction, no story glimpse, no empathy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—witnessing the overlooked—is signaled early and deepens when the janitor chooses slow communion over collection. The tightening occurs at the fragment discovery: instead of routine cleanup, they kneel, refracting light into narrative. This agency-driven deepening reweights the entire premise: maintenance becomes sacred empathy. Cost is felt in the “strange peace of no longer having to burn”—a vulnerability the janitor honors at personal emotional risk. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens via cadence shift from observation to revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the janitor’s actions: strength in vulnerability isn’t stated but enacted through handling dimmed fragments with primal elegance. The final image—“quiet fire that burned in gentle hands”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: what is power? Subtext operates in silence (kneeling), gesture (tracing), and object (lantern refracting loss into story). No moralizing; complexity endures—stars must burn to be seen, yet find peace only in dimming.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, filtered entirely through the janitor’s spiritually curious perception. Voice has distinct texture: rhythmic cadence (“each breath a meditation”), elevated but precise diction (“luminous fingerprints,” “primal elegance”) that never drifts into academic register. Syntax varies purposefully—long, flowing sentences for stillness; short clauses for revelation (“They saw... They felt...”). Perceptual signature is consistent: notices light residue, not machinery; prioritizes memory over data.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“amber surface catching the dawn like captured sunlight”) and avoids paraphrase loops. Sentences vary in structure and length, matching the janitor’s meditative pace. Minor overwriting in “residue of speed and fire and longing” (three abstractions stacked), but forgiven by immediate grounding in action. Final paragraph’s cadence (“profound strength... quiet fire... sacred importance”) resonates without redundancy. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks; every line advances atmosphere or character.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms the “janitor” trope into a cosmic witness whose tools and rituals feel freshly specific. The synthesis of shooting stars as exhausted beings, the lantern as empathic interface, and “flourishing stillness” as active potential feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure, no dialogue, no plot “events”) heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Originality lies in making cosmic scale intimate through tactile humility—no derivative templates.</comment>
