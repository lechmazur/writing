<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her trauma manifests through tactile rituals, not therapy-speak. Micro-choices (keeping the photograph crumpled, refusing to smooth it) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Her quiet talent isn’t just stated; it’s enacted through precise, somatic interactions with plants that mirror her emotional state. The freeze response is rendered as nervous-system truth, not melodrama.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she renounces healing-as-destination and builds “a place” where optimism grows from realistic soil—a Charged Poise crystallized in the night-blooming cereus. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: grief arrives like weather, but each recurrence tightens her somatic anchoring until the final reconfiguration. Cost is legible in the unsmoothed photograph and the lighthouse kept dark—symbols of foreclosed futures. Orientation anchors immediately: “She found the lighthouse property three years after the wedding that wasn’t.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—it’s broken, salt-crusted, and on a cliff, demanding daily repair. The sea, arbutus, and ceramic pots are tactile anchors that shape her actions. Final image charges closure: the cereus bloom exists only because of this specific environment’s harsh realism. Every sensory detail (salt crust, soil under nails, air temperature) serves somatic grounding, never decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—building a survivable present amid irreversible loss—is signaled early and deepened through her refusal to “heal” conventionally. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: each morning’s ritual narrows her world to manageable somatic markers until the cereus bloom becomes possible. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits closure (keeps photo crumpled), light (lighthouse stays dark), and narrative recovery. Coincidence never resolves; resilience is earned through repetitive, physical acts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: optimism rooted in realism, not denial. The crumpled photograph and cereus bloom reweight each other—the former embodies irreversible damage, the latter fragile persistence. Final insight avoids moralizing; it’s non-literal (“a place where optimism could grow… from the realistic soil of what could actually… wither and survive”). Subtext lives in gesture: her hands resurrect plants but never smooth the photo, showing acceptance without erasure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: she notices plant pulses, soil resistance, air temperature—never abstractions. Rhythm modulates masterfully: short sentences during freeze responses, lyrical flow in greenhouse routines. No head-hopping; single POV remains tightly focalized. Voice stays consistent even in reflection—the botanical text soft from handling grounds memory in present objects.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: “the sky opened and took everything except her hands” conveys catastrophe economically. Figurative language is restrained and coherent (greenhouse as cathedral, grief as weather). Minor artifact: “somatic markers of the present anchored her more reliably than any abstract promise of recovery” edges toward diagnostic phrasing but is immediately grounded in soil/stem/air details. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances character or atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms trauma tropes through specificity: the drone strike is implied but never named, focusing on bodily aftermath. “Pearl of stillness” feels fresh because it arises from horticultural patience, not spiritual cliché. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative shards of routine) heightens stakes by making small acts monumental. Vision coheres: voice, setting, and theme fuse into a singular meditation on endurance.</comment>
