<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Qishti’s frugality, empiricism, and devotion are embodied in micro-choices (counting tiles, tracing lines) that escalate under pressure. His internal contradiction—man of numbers confronting faith—is dramatized without diagnostic labels. The final renunciation of measurement for felt devotion is earned through three nights of struggle. Cost is visible: his threadbare robe, the lost tile, the rewritten skin.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “What is measured is never lost” reframes the universe as dialogue, not machine. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the density of schematics, starlight, and silence builds to a cadence shift at the altar. Cost is legible in Qishti’s altered hands and the palace’s tremor. Every beat tightens toward this reconfiguration without causal slippage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The black tile functions as micro-setting, constraining Qishti’s choices (stealth, study, descent) and charging the final image when its lines rewrite onto his skin. Palace mosaics, braziers, and ziggurat light are filtered through his astronomer’s attention. Spatial choreography is precise: cracked floors → throne pillar → underground altar. The desert’s breath and damp air ground the mystical in tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decoding hidden order—tightens when the schematic shifts from celestial to terrestrial devotion. Qishti’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to return, trace, descend, and place the tile. Cost is unmistakable: loss of the object, transformation of self, and irreversible covenant with the unknown. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without reliance on coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: ink-stained hems, warm tiles, flaring schematics. The ending offers a non-literal answer—devotion exceeds measurement—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and the stars’ newfound intimacy. Final line (“some devotions are too vast for numbers”) resonates as earned wisdom, not prompt-think.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled, filtering all perception through Qishti’s empirical yet poetic sensibility. Syntax modulates with pressure: short clauses during stealth, lyrical flow at revelation. Distinct perceptual signature—counting grains, mapping constellations—shapes diction and rhythm. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., skipped guard encounters) serves tension without confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “sandals whispering against cracked mosaic,” “stone groaned, then split like a fruit.” Figurative language is coherent (stars as eyes, tile as seed). Minor overwriting in “empirically ironic thrill” slightly jars, but closure remains unblurred. Sentence variety and paragraph cuts serve momentum; no loops or scaffold detected.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: astronomy as devotion, schematics as love letters, palace as cosmic instrument. Tropes (hidden passages, ancient keys) are transformed by Qishti’s specific frugality and empirical irony. Risk-taking (quiet climax, conceptual repricing) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular—neither pastiche nor template.</comment>
