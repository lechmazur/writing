<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Veyra’s motivation—rooted in her mentor’s disappearance and the quest for resilience—is embodied through micro-choices (landing on the arch, reaching into the fracture) that escalate under pressure. Her internal conflict between loss and discovery pulses beneath every action without over-articulation. The moss’s physical effect on her skin concretizes transformation rather than stating it. Final renunciation of passive searching for active cultivation feels earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: resilience is not found but grown—a shift made legible through the sapling’s emergence and Veyra’s changed role. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: recurring spirals, echoes, and moss coalesce into a final chorus that reweights all prior imagery with cost (the arrow tip’s dust, the inversion’s end). Gravity’s return imposes real-time pressure, and the seed’s retrieval forecloses old modes of seeking. Cost is visible in the crumbling relic and the irreversible moss spread.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard planet functions as both macro-setting and micro-setting—the floating arches, inverted rivers, and bioluminescent moss directly constrain Veyra’s navigation and choices. Every sensory detail (violet sky, golden sap, whirling silence) serves urgency or theme without tourist cataloging. The glider, moss, and seed act as tool/body/setting hybrids that charge the final image. World rules remain consistent and are revealed through action, not exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the source of resilience—is signaled early and deepens when Veyra realizes it must be cultivated, not located. Pressure tightens via the inversion’s ticking clock and the arch’s fracture-as-mouth, forcing a decisive dive. Agency drives escalation: she chooses to reach in, plant later, answer the planet. Cost is felt in the lost mentor, the broken arrow, and the irreversible bodily change—but the inversion’s end slightly softens consequence by resetting the orchard too cleanly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the planet’s logic: resilience as generative, not defensive. The sapling’s silent song and the chorus of arches offer a non-literal answer to the central question—echoes as instructions, not ghosts. No moralizing; insight arises from the seed’s pulsing spirals matching rock and river patterns. Final image reweights all prior “fractures” as beginnings, embracing complexity without false balance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled, filtered through Veyra’s pilot-specific perception (“navigating by upward river,” “rudder adjustment”). Voice modulates with pressure: short, kinetic sentences during flight; lyrical cadence at revelation. Perceptual signature is distinct—she notices growth rates, current shifts, fracture geometries. No head-hopping, no register drift; even elevated phrases (“whirling silence”) feel earned by her vocation and trauma.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line payoff (e.g., “moss didn’t just glow—it accelerated growth”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (spirals, echoes, fractures) and culminates coherently. Minor overwriting in mid-flight description (“bioluminescent moss that pulsed faster…”) slightly slows momentum, but closure beats remain crisp. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary effectively to mirror disorientation then clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise transforms familiar tropes (chosen one, planetary mystery) through rigorous internal logic: gravity inversions as ecological reset, echoes as pedagogical signals. The synthesis of botany, physics, and myth feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (silent sapling, moss-as-symbiont) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision is singular—resilience as co-creation—not a prompt collage.</comment>
