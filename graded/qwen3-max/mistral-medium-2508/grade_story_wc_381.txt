<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The summoner’s interiority is vividly embodied—her hollow-eyed stare, searing failure, and earned stillness reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her micro-choices (unfolding the wing, shaping silence into a net) stem from consistent traits and intensify with stakes. The final renunciation isn’t tidy but resonant: solitude becomes wholeness through cost—the prophecy’s scream softened to a sigh. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile action and image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the summoner endures, foreclosing panic or flight, and the world softens around her hush. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via sensory layering until the origami’s reverse-unfolding reconfigures meaning. Cost is legible in the “tattered, glowing” wing and her seared skin; the final image (“the hush was hers”) crystallizes a before/after without exposition. Every beat tightens toward this charged poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The brook, moss, origami wing, and crane’s shadow function as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: the water stills only when touched by paper; the wing drinks moonlight to glow; dawn’s approach pressures closure. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—cold sear, silver bleed, glittering shards—filtered through the summoner’s mythic perception. The nocturnal haven isn’t backdrop but crucible; its reeds bow in response to ritual, charging the final image with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—hushing a prophecy that unravels the world through unspoken fear—is signaled early and deepens via the summoner’s agency: she maps silence, weaves counter-spells, lunges at the escaping thread. The escalation is textural but decisive: the brook shatters, secrets scatter, yet her crafted hush lessens the prophecy’s weight. Cost is unmistakable—seared skin, tattered wing, solitude—and reweights the final moment: not victory, but reprieve earned through attention-as-action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as active resistance to collective dread, not absence but shaped space. The origami wing’s transformation—from tool to lattice to quiet relic—reweights “silence” from void to vessel. Final image offers non-literal answer: peace isn’t erasure but modulation (“not a scream. Just a sigh”). No moralizing; resonance accrues through concrete particulars—the crane’s dawn flight felt as benediction, not explained.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful: the summoner notices ripples as “forgotten tongue,” moonlight as “eerie light,” silence as something that can be “cut” or “smoothed.” Rhythmic control modulates with pressure—long, liquid sentences for ritual; staccato snaps (“Then—*snap*.”) for rupture. Voice remains singular, poetic without register drift; even elevated diction (“terrestrially cosmic”) feels native to her mythic cognition. No head-hopping; POV modesty intact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each line multitasks (e.g., “edges bleeding silver into the air” conveys visual, motion, and decay). Figurative language is coherent: silence is fabric (“net of smoothed hush”), prophecy a serpent, fear has “weight.” Minor overwriting in “terrestrially cosmic tension” slightly strains physical logic, but payoff in “stars pulsed in their terrestrially cosmic rhythm” redeems it. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts; final paragraph’s cadence breathes like the brook itself.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Transforms summoner tropes through specificity: origami as ritual object, prophecy as sonic architecture, silence as mappable terrain. The “flow” concept replaces dream logic with current-like inevitability; “tranquil blaze” fuses opposites into tonal engine. Risk-taking (lyric structure, abstract stakes) heightens coherence—every image serves the core question: Can quiet heal a screaming world? Fresh synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, yet utterly singular.</comment>
