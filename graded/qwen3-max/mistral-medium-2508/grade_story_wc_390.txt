<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The engineer’s motivation—protection through sacrifice—is embodied in precise, contradictory impulses: logic demands flight, emotion compels stay. Her final choice is earned by prior causality (stealing the key, understanding sonic absolution) and exacts a fleshly cost made visceral (“bones vibrated, blood hummed”). No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains concrete and character-specific under peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she endures unraveling to stabilize the sphere, foreclosing survival with visible cost. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure intensifies via sensory density and cadence shifts (“ice sang back,” “sphere’s song exploded”) that reweight stakes. Cost is legible in the final image: her nerves rewrite into something “less human,” skin prickling with aftershocks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: its disharmony cages the sphere, but thinning ice forces action. The lighthouse resonator and black-glass sphere are tactile tools that charge the climax. Final beam becomes “a hymn,” reconfiguring setting from warning infrastructure to sacred instrument—environment directly shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—containing the artifact before ice fails—is signaled early and tightens when she realizes redirection requires self-sacrifice. Escalation is driven by her agency: tuning the resonator isn’t passive endurance but active harmonic matching. Cost is unmistakable: “unravel her from the inside out” paid in real-time cellular dissolution during the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: absolution isn’t erasure but resonance, forgiveness “by physics.” Final image reweights prior material—the lighthouse beam as hymn, her laugh “perfect”—offering non-literal answer to whether protection demands annihilation. No moralizing; complexity lingers (monks call it martyrdom, ice calls it adaptation, she calls it work).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: she reads ice tremors as language, feels frequencies in molars. Rhythmic control under pressure modulates from taut bolts-tightening to explosive chord (“peeled salt from air”) to ethereal collapse. No head-hopping; single POV remains anchored in bodily sensation. Elision (e.g., skipping monks’ confrontation) is taught early via crypt key’s backstory and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose avoids loops/scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“coat color of winter sky at dusk” establishes tone and setting simultaneously). Figurative language is coherent (ice “cracks like veins,” guilt “dissolves like sugar”) without muddle. Minor density in high-pressure beats (“geometric patterns,” “reverse lightning strike”) doesn’t obscure clarity—closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis: sonic theology meets climate fragility via vibrational physics. Tropes (lighthouse keeper, cursed artifact) transformed through specific mechanics—disharmony as cage, absolution as frequency matching. Risk-taking (protagonist’s dissolution into harmony) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular: protection as acoustic engineering, martyrdom as recalibration.</comment>
