<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “cautiously hopeful heart pounding” and teeth-aching pressure reveal contradiction without therapy-speak. Her micro-choices (hovering over the transmit switch, calibrating subsonics) align with a decade-long professional identity now under siege. The grad student’s interruption crystallizes her renunciation of institutional validation in favor of cosmic dialogue—a credible endurance with social cost. No diagnostic labels; emotion arises through tactile detail and calibrated risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Liora’s final reach for the dial reconfigures human-alien interaction from adversarial to conversational, with scars-as-proof implying communal cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the signal’s pattern break mirrors campus tension shifts—and intensifies via three pulses that narrow options (disrupting factions, halting chants). Cost is legible in the dean’s search and the air’s “unspoken” thrum. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3; causality holds without retroactive patches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The radio station functions as micro-setting: its “forgotten current” enables defiance, while dials and charts constrain tactics (smudged ink, sleeve-brushed margins). The ventilation kicking on charges the final image as stars “shift,” tying environment to cosmic recalibration. Sensory hierarchy reflects Liora’s urgency—static “like angry stars,” subsonic shivers in building bones—avoiding tourist cataloging. Tool (headphones) and body (aching teeth) co-function as setting, shaping every key choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving humanity isn’t pawns—tightens when Liora’s interference halts campus fractures, raising the cost of exposure (dean’s search). Her agency drives escalation: calibration → pulse → frequency tweak → signal’s curious shift. Coincidence complicates (faculty leaks) but never resolves; the alien’s “laughter” pressures her toward bolder action. Felt cost appears in professors’ “thin” voices and drooping signs—concrete losses altering later tactics (stealth becomes impossible).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through signal-as-mirror: cosmic patterns reflect human division, then curiosity after intervention. Final image (“universe was still talking. And now, so was she”) offers non-literal answer—agency lies in response, not control—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (charts fluttering, air thrumming) and avoids binaries; the “tricksters” aren’t villains but testers. Recurring static transforms from threat to conversation, reweighting isolation into connection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is precise: Liora notices frequencies before faces, constellations before crises. Rhythm modulates—short clauses for pulses (“The first pulse sent a shiver”), lyrical flow for reflection (“static hissed… like a nest of angry stars”). No head-hopping; grad student’s voice contrasts with Liora’s terse authority (“I was just fixing the radio”). Diction stays within astrophysicist lexicon (“subsonic,” “harmonic resonance”) without academic drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose balances density and propulsion: “static hissed… like a nest of angry stars” merges sound/tactile/image in one clause. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances plot or atmosphere. Figurative coherence—signal as “needle pulling string,” campus holding “breath”—serves pressure without muddle. Final line’s cadence (“And now, so was she”) echoes opening headphones, closing the loop with earned simplicity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms “alien signal” trope via academic infighting as cosmic mirror—fresh angle where power plays fracture both human and cosmic realms. Specificity abounds: keycard denial, grant squabbles, ink-smudged charts. Risk-taking in making the climax auditory (subsonics) rather than visual pays off through embodied stakes (teeth ache, building shivers). Premise feels inevitable in hindsight; no template safety.</comment>
