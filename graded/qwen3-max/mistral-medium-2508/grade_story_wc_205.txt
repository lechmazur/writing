<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias’s motivation—revision over vengeance—is rooted in his identity as poet-revolutionary and consistently drives micro-choices (covering mirrors, handling the shard). His internal contradiction (desire to restore vs. acceptance of loss) culminates in Earned Stasis: he endures the vase’s final destruction to let memory speak. Taelis serves as effective pressure without overshadowing; her gasp validates Elias’s stance without diluting his agency. The shard’s dusting carries visible cost, foreclosing physical proof but affirming poetic truth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the archaeologists’ rigid historiography is reweighted by witnessed poetry, making “remembered” superior to “excavated.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via time-strands, storm light, and refracted visions until the cathedral briefly reassembles. Cost is legible in the shard’s irreversible dusting and Elias’s relinquishment of tangible proof. Orientation anchors instantly (“asteroid Lachrymae,” “Elias Veyra”), and the single scene tightens coherently toward Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid isn’t backdrop—it’s active micro-setting: time-strands pulse with memory, storm winds charge particles to ignite visions, and the cathedral’s ruins constrain Elias’s ritual (mirrors must be covered *here*). The crystal shard functions as object-as-setting, its refraction mechanics enabling the climax. Final image—Elias pressing palm to altar as storm rages—charges closure by merging environment, body, and tool into one resonant gesture. Every sensory detail (glowing ropes, irradiated silk, hummed chants) filters through Elias’s poetic perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—validating the Republic’s legacy against reductionist archaeology—is signaled early and deepens when Elias chooses poetic resurrection over data. His agency drives escalation: covering mirrors triggers the vision, fracturing the shard to force witness. Cost is unmistakable—the vase’s final destruction—and narrows options irreversibly. Taelis’s presence crystallizes pressure, but coincidence (the storm) merely enables; Elias’s method earns the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: civilization as woven memory vs. extracted data. The recurring shard shifts from relic to catalyst to dust, reweighting “proof” as experiential rather than empirical. Final line—“It was beautiful, after all. And it was his”—offers non-literal answer: ownership lies in remembrance, not excavation. Avoids moralizing; resonance accrues via concrete particulars (murals bleeding color, children’s mosaic faces) rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled single-third, filtered through Elias’s poetic sensibility (“baroque spires,” “time-strands glow like embers”). Voice modulates under pressure: lyrical density intensifies during the vision (“murals bled color”) then simplifies to stark clarity at closure. Dialogue distinguishes Taelis’s clinical certainty (“tampering with a dead culture”) from Elias’s quiet authority (“I’m letting it speak”). No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent even in shared scenes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and varied, with strong verbs (“unspooling,” “knitting,” “splinter”) and rhythmic control. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats: “time-strands around them *twisted*, knitting the cathedral’s ruins back into wholeness” slightly strains metaphor coherence (strands knit architecture?). No loops or scaffolding; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Final paragraph’s simplicity (“storm raged on… time was beautiful”) earns its resonance through prior density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: temporal anarchy as devotional practice, not chaos. Transforms archaeological trope by making the “dispute” a clash of epistemologies (data vs. poetry), resolved through embodied ritual. Risk-taking—lyric structure, conceptual time—heightens stakes without gimmickry. The asteroid’s baroque decay and wrist-threads feel irreplaceable; removing any core element (shard, storm, mirrors) collapses the logic. Vision feels inevitable in hindsight, grounded in established rules (refraction, priestesses’ silk).</comment>
