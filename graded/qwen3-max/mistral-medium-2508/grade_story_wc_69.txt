<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his grief for the vanished choir manifests through tactile engagement with the rosette and micro-choices like humming “the shape of a tune.” The four remaining singers each reveal distinct, flawed humanity through minimal but precise gestures (tremor, flinch, bullet-scarred folder). Their collective endurance constitutes an Earned Stasis: they renounce volume for presence, with visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions pulse beneath quiet surfaces.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds tightly: pressure builds via sensory density (amber light, crushed oak, damp scarves) and cadence shifts from solitary reflection to fragile communal hum. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the choir’s reassembly around absence reweights silence as active participation. Cost is legible in the hollowed-out rosette and frayed voices; the final image (“air shimmered with the weight of what they were learning to hold”) crystallizes stakes without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The velvet library functions as micro-setting: its “traveled stillness” pressures choices by offering sanctuary where noise is subtracted, not added. Autumn’s stripping trees mirror the choir’s attrition, and stained-glass amber literally illuminates the rosette’s grain during the climax. Spatial choreography remains coherent (table center, doorway entrance), and the rosette constrains the final action—its vibration validates their fragile harmony. Every detail serves texture or tactic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving communal voice amid societal unlearning—is signaled early and deepens when Elias shifts from notation to subtraction. His agency drives escalation: choosing to gather remnants, place the rosette centrally, and hum negative space. Cost is unmistakable in lost members, trembling hands, and bullet scars; the tightening forecloses loud harmony but opens possibility through quiet presence. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the rosette’s worn lacewood, sheet music in a scarred folder, and “silences scribbled” reject abstraction. Subtext thrives in what’s withheld—arguments over “whose pain deserved to be heard” imply real-world fractures without exposition. The ending offers non-literal resolution: listening to cracks becomes the new harmony, reweighting loss as generative space. No moralizing; resonance accrues through embodied ritual.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is single, intimate third-person with Elias’s perceptual signature—musician’s attention to grain, breath, harmonic hum. Voice modulates rhythmically: long, liquid sentences for memory; staccato fragments for tension (“No one spoke. / No one had to”). Dialogue is sparse but distinct (contralto’s throat-clear, baritone’s exhale-as-prayer). Free indirect thought merges seamlessly (“he thought of the way hatred worked…”), and diction stays within his lexicon—no register drift even in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “stained-glass windows bleeding amber across the shelves like slow fire” establishes tone without overwriting. Figurative language is coherent (light/fire/bleeding motifs recur organically), and sentence openings vary (“Elias turned it…”, “Outside, autumn stripped…”, “He pressed his ear…”). One minor artifact: “subtracting noise—the kind that drowned out quiet things” slightly abstracts, but closure beat (“rosette vibrated, just slightly”) redeems with concrete specificity. Zero loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms “vanishing arts” trope through hyper-specificity: zither rosette as relic, choir attrition via ideological fracture, notation of silences. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative lyricism over plot) heightens thematic stakes—quiet as resistance. Fresh inflection in closure: harmony redefined as “possibility” woven from thread-thin voices. No derivative echoes; vision feels singular and urgent.</comment>
