<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her pain, translator’s instinct, and moral fatigue manifest through tactile detail (coral, cast, ribs) rather than exposition. Her “shrewd innocence” isn’t labeled but enacted in how she reads smudges as dialect. The final choice to walk toward the mist feels earned by her history of grafting meaning onto rupture, with visible cost in her singing ribs. No diagnostic label-speak; even memory is filtered through present sensation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Lena redefines static as sea-song, transforming grief into legible language. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image (coral, cast, photo) layers density until the final glow on the cast reweights all prior silence. Cost is legible in Lena’s physical ache and the boy’s white-knuckled grip. Orientation anchors instantly (“atrium,” “Lena,” “dusk”) and never wavers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The atrium functions as micro-setting: ivy like barbed wire, mist coiling at ankles, glass ceiling bruised by twilight—all constrain perception and echo trauma. Coral and plaster cast operate as environmental extensions that charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy narrows under stress (cool mist, biting ridges), then expands in resolution (glowing smudges). Every detail serves pressure or closure; no white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translating unspoken grief—is signaled early and deepens when Lena shifts from interpreter to grafter. Her agency drives escalation: decrypting the cast, then the photo, each act narrowing emotional isolation. Cost is felt in her ribs and the boy’s hitched breath. The siren’s fade implies endless demand, foreclosing rest—a Charged Poise where duty crystallizes without respite.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurring acts of decryption: silence isn’t void but coded dialect. The coral’s ridges become a tactile lexicon for loss, culminating in the cast’s ember-glow—a non-literal answer to “How do we hold the gone?” No moralizing; resonance lives in the boy clutching coral as “first true sentence.” Subtext thrives in negative space (marker-scrawled photo, phantom radio static).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: Lena notices soldier-twitches and cold tea, not abstractions. Syntax modulates with pressure—longer sentences for memory, fragmented beats for pain (“ribs singing”). Free indirect style merges her translator’s mind with narration (“unknotting the child’s fear like a cipher”). Dialogue is sparse but distinct: boy’s thin voice vs. Lena’s terse wisdom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—“bruise of violet and gold,” “static was just the sea, answering”—with zero paraphrase loops. Figurative language is coherent (coral = labyrinth = shore-memory). Minor overwriting in “mortar fire stuttered” (slight cliché), but rhythm varies masterfully. Final line’s “embers cupped in careful hands” earns its lyricism through prior tactile buildup.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms war-zone translator trope via specificity: Mindanao rebels, plaster casts as texts, coral as mnemonic. “Unknotting” replaces heroic intervention with quiet semiotic labor. Risk-taking in lyric structure pays off—the mosaic of wounds (shrapnel, photo, cast) coheres into a new grammar of care. No derivative echoes; vision feels singular and necessary.</comment>
