<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dye master’s interiority is vividly embodied—his trembling hands, breath hitching, pulse quickening—and his contradictory impulses (desire for understanding vs. fear of intrusion) drive every micro-choice. His transformation from passive observer to active conduit feels earned through tactile engagement with the wing and ink. The heart’s “recognition” isn’t diagnostic but sensory, rooted in physical response. Final renunciation of solitude carries visible cost: he leaves his tea house, returns changed, yet endures with new purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the heart becomes “his own” not through possession but integration, foreclosing his former isolation with the cost of permanent relational vulnerability. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—light, color, and silence accrue meaning until the final image reweights everything. Orientation is immediate (“floating rock above the valley”), and the pattern of illumination→story→connection tightens coherently. Cost is legible in the brittle wing dissolving into his palm—a literal and symbolic sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its isolation mirrors his emotional state, and leaving it marks irreversible commitment. The morpho wing, sun trails, and mist aren’t backdrop but active agents—the wing’s iridescence dictates when and how stories emerge; mist swallows words yet thickens meaning. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: early focus on visual shimmer gives way to tactile dissolution (“sugar in tea”). Final image of steam curling into a question mark charges closure with atmospheric specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding why stories magnetize—is signaled early and deepens when the heart aches at the blind poet. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to paint, to follow the map, to unfold the wing in the square. Each act narrows options—he cannot unsee the villagers’ cracks, cannot return unchanged. Cost is felt in burned arms and dissolved wing; the final price is relinquishing control over narrative ownership, becoming a vessel rather than a master.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through iridescence as metaphor for fragile, shifting truth—not stated but enacted via ink that moves only while light holds it. The story resists moralizing; instead, the final image of internalized sun trails offers a non-literal answer: stories aren’t possessed but witnessed, and being seen is both wound and balm. Ambiguity lingers—why some magnetize stories remains unanswered—but the cost of connection is undeniable. No platitudes; wisdom arises from cobblestone dye and brittle wings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exquisite: the dye master notices light through a craftsman’s eye (“cobalt to violet to warning gold”), and syntax mirrors his transformation—early sentences are precise and controlled, later ones fluid and lyrical as he surrenders to the current. Voice modulates under pressure: short, breathless clauses during revelation (“The ink moved.”), then expansive cadence in resolution. No head-hopping; even the traveler’s dialogue (“crushed petals”) serves his POV. Elision is purposeful—three moons pass in one phrase—and pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence multitasks (e.g., “mist curled through the gaps, thick enough to mute the world below” establishes setting, mood, and thematic silence). Figurative language is pattern-taught—iridescence, dissolution, light-as-ink—and never muddled. Zero loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts serve rhythm (e.g., single-line “The ink moved.”). Final line (“silence… felt like an invitation”) recharges the opening’s muteness with earned resonance. No register drift; diction stays rooted in artisanal lexicon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesizing transplant narrative, craft lore, and storytelling myth into a quiet parable where power resides in receptivity, not control. The morpho wing—a biological marvel—becomes both compass and sacrifice, avoiding trope through specific use (dissolving in palm, not talismanic). Risk-taking in lyric structure pays off: mosaic shards (tea house → village → return) feel inevitable. Emotional truth outweighs novelty; the “quietly explosive” force is communal recognition, not individual heroism.</comment>
