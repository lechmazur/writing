<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The fisher’s cool-headed endurance is embodied through tactile micro-choices—pressing palm to dirt, voicing silence, driving the spike—that reveal a hierarchy of values: protecting his daughter’s memory over chasing false echoes. His grief is never named but rendered in physical specificity (teeth vibrating, stems blackening). The final renunciation—letting go of her voice—is earned by thirty years of pursuit and crystallized in the rail spike’s reuse. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in action, not summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the fisher forecloses chasing his daughter’s echo, accepting silence as the only true tribute. Cost is legible in the blackened stems, hollow breath, and teeth-smooth-as-stones—concrete residues of sacrifice. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern break (sleepwalking stars) intensifies via soil’s unrest, pebble-spelled name, and goddess’s mouth, each deepening the emotional frequency until silence becomes command. Every beat tightens the thematic coil without causal slippage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The sound wave garden isn’t backdrop but active crucible: its hum guides choices (digging where soil refuses to hum), its stems react to poisoned echoes, its sigh seals closure. The rail spike—a tool forged from grief—constrains tactics (driving it silences the garden, striking hollow earth reveals the goddess). Sensory hierarchy prioritizes vibration (teeth, bones, roots) over visuals, mirroring the fisher’s attunement to subsonic truth. Final image of dock water swallowing stars charges the theme: some silences must be carried, not solved.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming his daughter’s voice from mimicry—tightens when pebbles spell her name, forcing a choice between hope and protection. Agency drives escalation: he voices silence twice (question then command), digs away from her grave, and rejects the echo’s lure. Cost is unmistakable: blackened garden, stolen teeth, and the rail spike’s cold burn—a price that alters future tactics (melt or dig?). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each sensory distortion (zigzag stars, split air) raises emotional stakes without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: silence as both weapon and sanctuary, echoes as theft. The final image—stars still, garden humming, voice finally quiet—offers a non-literal answer: true love releases, doesn’t reclaim. Subtext thrives in absence (unspoken name, unturned head) and charged objects (spike, teeth, net). No moralizing; resonance builds from the fisher’s refusal to let grief be hijacked, making silence sacred rather than empty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: the fisher notices frequencies, not colors; textures (wet silk air, river-stone teeth), not abstractions. Syntax modulates with pressure—longer sentences for ritual (tracing grooves), staccato for climax (“He drove the rail spike”). Voice remains consistent even in lyric density; no head-hopping, no register drift. Elision (thirty-year backstory compressed into fever/silence/tree) is taught early and pays off in the pebble-spelled name’s devastation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “air split like wet silk,” “stems blackened where it touched.” Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language serves causality (garden screams in teeth-vibrating frequency). Minor deduction for slight over-compression in “roots could sing her to the goddess”—a rare near-abstraction—but closure beats (“shadow filled the gap”) redeem with visceral clarity. Read-aloud rhythm varies masterfully, from hum to scream to sigh.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms mythic tropes (goddess, constellations) into intimate physics: grief as frequency, silence as command. The sleepwalking stars aren’t metaphor but active threat—their unraveling paths demand tactical response. Originality lies in the fisher’s method: voicing silence as weapon, net catching teeth not fish. Risk-taking (lyric density, abstract concepts grounded in body) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final image feels inevitable yet fresh: a father’s love measured in what he refuses to hear.</comment>
