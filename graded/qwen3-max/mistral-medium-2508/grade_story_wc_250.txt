<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The boy’s shame and the guardian’s silent empathy are rendered through embodied contradiction—trembling hands, unspoken apologies, calloused fingers brushing water—not diagnostic labels. The guardian’s micro-choices (tilting the mirror, weaving shutters) reveal a hierarchy of values: witnessing over fixing. Their interaction avoids tidy resolution; the father’s off-page shift is shown only through physical tells (shoulders unclenching), preserving emotional realism. Both characters remain flawed yet legible, with the dental mirror functioning as a proxy for connection.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns of light/dark intensify until the stars’ reflection reweights silence as listening. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—the canal “holding” both dock and stars reframes darkness not as absence but as necessary space. Cost is legible in the crumpled note abandoned and the father’s breath-fogged mirror left unsaid. Every beat tightens the thematic coil without causal slippage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, rain-slick planks, and fogged canal aren’t backdrop—they’re active constraints shaping movement (scuffing boots, kneeling) and perception (refracted lantern light). The dental mirror and boathouse shutters function as micro-settings that directly enable the guardian’s method. Weather affects action (first raindrop cues arrival) and culminates in erased patterns, charging the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through urgency: visual refraction dominates during tension, tactile water-skin at release.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—carrying unspoken guilt—is signaled early (“pockets stuffed with stolen nails and a half-written apology”) and deepens via the boy’s tremors and hitched breath. The guardian’s weaving escalates pressure by offering nonjudgmental witness, forcing the boy to confront his shame without absolution. Cost is visible: the discarded note, the father’s delayed but palpable thaw. Agency resides in attention—both characters choose to see and be seen.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through image and action: stars reflected in water reframe silence as receptivity, not void. The final line crystallizes the core concept without moralizing—“courage to let darkness hold the light” grows inevitably from the mirror’s arc. Subtext thrives in what’s withheld (no dialogue from guardian, no direct reconciliation), inviting reflection on empathy as presence, not repair. Ambiguity lingers (Will the father speak?), but resonance is undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: the guardian notices shadows “pooling like forgotten promises,” the boy perceives footsteps as threat. Syntax modulates with pressure—long, liquid sentences during weaving; fractured clauses at emotional peaks (“He used to tell me their names”). No head-hopping; even the expanded morning shard remains anchored to observable behavior (father turning mirror in hands). Voice is consistent, poetic without pretension, and every deviation (e.g., “spiralingly calm”) serves character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the canal’s breath fogged the air” merges setting and sensation economically. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light/shadow motifs) and payoff-perfect (stars “spill across his hunched back”). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor deduction for slight over-reliance on visual metaphor in mid-section, but closure image (“darkness hold the light”) earns its lyricism through prior restraint.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms the “wise hermit” trope via specificity: a nameless dock guardian using dental mirrors and shutters to refract starlight. The core concept—silent empathy as active witnessing—is fresh in execution, not premise. Risk-taking (minimal dialogue, abstract stakes) heightens emotional precision without gimmickry. Every element feels irreplaceable; swapping “dental mirror” for “hand mirror” would gut the occupational texture and thematic weight of seeing/healing.</comment>
