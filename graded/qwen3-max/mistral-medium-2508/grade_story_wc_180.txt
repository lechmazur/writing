<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The mender’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—contradictory impulses (pride vs. longing, duty vs. curiosity) act simultaneously in scene. Their micro-choices (digging, planting, eating the apple) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The daughter’s absence is felt through precise sensory anchors (ribbon, doll, note), making her a crucible despite not being on-page. Flaws are consistent and consequential: their didacticism blinded them to their daughter’s autonomy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the mender reconfigures their stance from rigid silence to receptive humility, with conceptual cost—the contract is dust, but the vow endures in transformed form. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; density builds through recurring motifs (roots, vows, light) until the sprout crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible in the final image: the frayed ribbon now binds their wrist, a tactile reminder of loss and renewal. Orientation is immediate and sustained.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The orchard-cathedral hybrid setting constrains and charges every choice: roots guide the dig, light bends for planting, apples symbolize forbidden knowledge. Objects function as micro-settings—the ribbon, trowel, seed—all alter tactics or deepen stakes. Sensory detail is selective and urgent (damp earth as pulse, fruit smelling like forgiveness), filtered through the mender’s grief and profession. The final sprout emerges where light and ruin intersect, making environment inseparable from closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconciling silence with truth—is signaled early and tightens when the box reveals the daughter’s challenge. The mender’s agency drives escalation: they choose to dig, plant, and finally ask the question pride once forbade. Cost is unmistakable: relinquishing control over their daughter’s path, symbolized by leaving the doll behind. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens—each object and memory intensifies the emotional weight until the sprout forces reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: “deciduous vows” evolves from parental platitude to lived wisdom through the seed, sprout, and ribbon. Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and charged objects—no moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer: wisdom isn’t drilled like nails but grown like trees, requiring space to crack stone. Complexity is preserved—the priests’ rot, the daughter’s defiance, the mender’s regret—without false balance or tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is singular, lyric, and tightly focalized: every image filters through the quartz-eye mender’s tactile, ritualistic perception (“loam,” “crushed quartz,” “stitches uneven as a heartbeat”). Syntax modulates with pressure—longer sentences for reflection, sharp fragments for revelation (“The contract was dust. / The vow was not.”). No head-hopping; POV modesty is maintained. Diction remains within lexicon (no register drift), and rhythmic control heightens emotional beats without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“vows like leaves,” “roots like veins”) and pays off in the sprout’s upward twist. Minor overwriting in one high-pressure beat (“spilling its guts: a rusted trowel…”) slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors mar closure. Final lines achieve perfect cadence—economical, resonant, and irreversible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of cathedral ruin and living orchard transforms familiar tropes (lost child, broken vows) into something fresh and inevitable. Emotional specificity grounds the lyricism—the doll’s uneven stitches, the ribbon’s “bruised twilight” hue. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over causality) heightens stakes by making silence and soil equally eloquent. The core premise commits fully: wisdom grows in cracks, not commandments—and that insight reshapes every image without gimmickry.</comment>
