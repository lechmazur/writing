<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief, competence, and moral restraint cohere through micro-choices like pressing the locket to the globe. Her motivation (salvaging purity from wreckage) drives every action without over-explanation. The widow serves as effective secondary pressure, revealing Lena’s empathy and method without diluting focus. Final renunciation (“I just kept the parts worth saving”) earns its poignancy through prior causality and visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lena’s stance crystallizes around salvaged truth, not comfort, with clear conceptual cost—she bears witness while remaining unhealed. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: sensory density (candles, ice, glass) intensifies toward a cadence shift in the final paragraph (“The dead… were quiet”). Orientation is immediate (“glacier,” “shrine,” “Lena”), and the single scene tightens meaning without causal breaks. Cost is legible in the locket’s broken hinge and Lena’s enduring solitude.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The glacier shrine functions as both macro- and micro-setting: ice groans like ship timbers, candles pool light in the snow globe, and carved names constrain ritual. Every atmospheric detail pressures choice—the cold shapes breath, fog, and flame; the hollow shrine forces intimacy. Final image (“cracks were how the light got in”) reweights the setting’s symbolic logic without overt statement. Recurring objects (globe, locket, ice altar) evolve in function and meaning, charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus comfort in grief—is signaled early and deepens when Lena reveals the fisherman’s ghost was misread. Escalation is driven by Lena’s agency: she chooses to show the child, then her own mother, accepting emotional risk. Cost is unmistakable: the widow gains hope but Lena reopens her wound; both pay with tears that physically alter the globe. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens—each vision tightens thematic stakes without false resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: salvation lies not in closure but in fractured clarity (“windows… how the light got in”). The snow globe’s transformation—from frozen memory to living distortion—answers the central question non-literally: love persists in what’s left behind, not in ghosts. No moralizing; resonance accrues through specific images (kelp-net child, rusted locket). Final line reweights all prior wreckage as sites of potential illumination, embracing ambiguity without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is flawlessly controlled—third-person limited to Lena, with perceptual signature (“voices the color of old silver,” “laughter bubbling up like trapped air”). Syntax modulates under pressure: short clauses during visions, lyrical flow in reflection. Voice remains consistent even in elevated diction (“borrowed starlight”), which feels earned by Lena’s poetic vocation. No head-hopping; widow’s interiority is inferred only through gesture and dialogue, preserving focal integrity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“hull splitting like a wishbone,” “grief had warped the winter scene”). Figurative language is coherent (ice as vessel, light as liquid) and never muddled in peak beats. Zero paraphrase loops; rhythm varies naturally (fragments for tension, flowing clauses for revelation). Minor deduction for slight overuse of metaphor in opening paragraph, but no artifact dulls closure’s impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms ghost-whisperer trope through specificity: Lena’s power is auditory and tied to dreams, her shrine carved from glacial ice, her tools mundane yet charged (snow globe, locket). Emotional truth outweighs novelty—the father’s silent vigil via his son’s toy feels freshly observed. Risk-taking (lyric structure, dual visions) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final synthesis—light through cracks—feels inevitable yet surprising, grounded in every prior image.</comment>
