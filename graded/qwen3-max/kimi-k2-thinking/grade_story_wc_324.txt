<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception and micro-choices (e.g., adjusting the hearing aid, speaking Lila’s name), revealing a hierarchy of values rooted in curiosity and protection. Motivation intensifies credibly from spectral intrigue to life-saving action. The shift from tracing ghostly pulses to recognizing a living heart feels earned, not contrived. However, the man’s sudden appearance borders on coincidental rescue rather than fully motivated causality under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the atrium transforms from a liminal haunt to a space of active connection, with the photograph now a “beacon.” Cost is legible—the protagonist’s trembling hands, the risk of misinterpreting death—and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds throughout, deepening via sensory density and patterned echoes. The crash disrupts but doesn’t resolve; agency remains with the tracer’s choice to act. Orientation is immediate and sustained, with no disorientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium functions as a charged micro-setting: dew-slick pillars, marble acoustics, and dying light directly shape perception and movement. The hearing aid and photograph are tactile extensions of environment, constraining how the protagonist interprets and acts. Final image—mist curling like a “guardian’s cloak”—reconfigures the space from eerie to protective, fulfilling the 9+ gate. Sensory detail is selective, urgent, and POV-filtered without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting vulnerable voices—is signaled early and tightens when the pulse shifts from spectral to mortal, forcing a redefinition of “vulnerable.” The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: curiosity leads to intervention, not luck. Cost is visible (trembling hands, emotional exposure) and alters tactics (from listening to lifesaving). Coincidence complicates (the crash) but resolution stems from choice, satisfying Situational lens pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the porous boundary between living and dead, listening as protection. No moralizing; resonance accrues through the photograph’s transformation and the hearing aid’s dual function. Final image—child’s smile widening—offers a non-literal answer: being heard transcends life/death. Subtext thrives in silence (Lila’s breath, the man’s grip), avoiding sentimentality while affirming connection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, rhythmic, and perceptually biased—fog-thin voices, static resolving into names—modulating with pressure (shorter sentences during crisis). First-person POV remains consistent, with controlled psychic distance. Prose mirrors the tracer’s profession: attentive, precise, attuned to faint signals. No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon even at peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “plastic yellowed, its circuits humming faintly”). Figurative language is purposeful (“voices thin as fog”) and coherent. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“reeling hush” repeated) slightly dulls momentum, but closure beat remains sharp. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm varies naturally to match emotional cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise transforms tropes: “contact tracer for hearts” reframes grief work as active, technological haunting. Originality lies in the hearing aid’s repurposing and the atrium as liminal ER. Risk-taking (blending supernatural and medical emergency) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular—quietly urgent, emotionally precise—avoiding derivative “ghost whisperer” templates through grounded specificity.</comment>
