<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marek’s claustrophobia and survivor guilt are embodied with visceral specificity—trembling hands, recycled air that “breathes” panic—and their contradictory impulses (fear vs. duty) act simultaneously in scene. The final choice to bear witness without extraction is earned by prior trauma and ties directly to the cost: enduring psychological retraumatization to honor the erased. Chen’s handwriting naming Marek on the final codex page crystallizes motivation with devastating economy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Marek forecloses data retrieval or rescue, choosing presence over utility, with visible cost in rising water and fading ghostprints. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of sensory and emotional detail intensifies toward the seven-second sync, reweighting corporate erasure against human witness. Tidal timing and facility mechanics constrain every move; the “crashing hush” framing pays off in the final ascent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The flooded facility functions as a micro-setting that actively pressures choices: narrowing corridors trigger panic, moon pool transitions dictate timing, and server cradle water levels mark the countdown. The codex and undersea cables aren’t just backdrop—they’re tactile, constraining tools that charge the final image. Every sensory detail (rust, pneumatic sighs, calving-glacier airlocks) filters through Marek’s professional and traumatized POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bearing witness to the unremembered—is signaled early and tightens when Marek syncs with residual traces, trading personal safety for seven seconds of shared presence. The tidal window creates a live clock that narrows options, and claustrophobia compounds external pressure into internal crisis. Cost is unmistakable: psychological re-injury and near-drowning, accepted without extraction or resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between corporate erasure and electromagnetic grief—human cost encoded in infrastructure. The codex’s gold flecks reweight from navigational tool to memorial compass, culminating in the final image where Marek ascends holding inert illuminants, having fulfilled their purpose through presence alone. No moralizing; resonance arises from the specificity of ghostprints in fiber optics and the quiet refusal to commodify loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: technical precision (“quantum superposition,” “phase transitions”) fused with lyrical vulnerability (“bulkheads pressed like closing fists”). Syntax compresses under stress (“They placed their palm flat…”), then expands in reflection. Voice remains consistent even during sync sequence—no head-hopping, no register drift—and the “crashing hush” motif modulates tone from dread to elegy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “gold fleck illuminants… catching… like trapped stars” conveys object, function, and mood). Minor overwriting in two adjacent lines (“invisible things Marek tracked weren’t ghosts… but electromagnetic signatures”) edges toward paraphrase-loop, slightly dulling the ghostprint revelation. Otherwise, rhythm varies skillfully, and every image serves escalation or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deep-sea horror, data-ghost metaphysics, and memorial practice feels inevitable in hindsight. The “electromagnetic ghostprints” concept transforms corporate amnesia into tangible, trackable residue, and the tidal-phase mechanics ground speculative elements in physical stakes. Risk-taking (lyric density, abstract premise) heightens emotional clarity rather than obscuring it—Marek’s trauma and mission cohere into a singular, haunting vision.</comment>
