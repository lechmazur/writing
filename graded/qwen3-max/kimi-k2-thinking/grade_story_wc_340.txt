<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kai’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—curiosity, devotion, and quiet grief intertwine without sentimentality. Their micro-choice to don the goggles feels inevitable yet charged, revealing a hierarchy of values: understanding over propriety, connection over distance. The captain’s posthumous observations deepen Kai’s emotional arc without violating POV. Final renunciation—leaving the goggles behind—is earned, embodying “affectionate detachment” with tangible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kai endures grief but reconfigures it through revelation, foreclosing further searching. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—light, ice, and text layer into meaning via prismatic escalation. Cost is legible in the final image: service was seen, but the captain is gone. Orientation is precise by line 3; every beat tightens thematic pressure without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The icebound spire isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint and decoder. Ice refracts light to reveal script; altitude enables decryption; frozen walls mirror emotional clarity emerging from opacity. Goggles, diary, and elevator choreography are tactile and consequential. Final room’s emptiness gains weight because setting has shaped every prior choice. Micro-setting (goggles + ice) charges closure indelibly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“Was my quiet presence meaningful?”—tightens as each floor reveals deeper intimacy. Kai’s agency drives escalation: choosing to wear goggles, tilting the diary, interpreting dual scripts. Cost crystallizes in the ninth-floor entry: joy existed, but the giver is dead. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves—only attention earns revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through particulars: folded maps, humming while polishing brass, steam as spirits. No moralizing—the final insight (“stories unfold through attention”) arises from embodied discovery, not assertion. Subtext thrives in what the captain noticed but never voiced. Closure reweights ten years of service: duty becomes lifeline, invisibility becomes witness. Quiet resonance avoids binaries or false comfort.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is flawlessly controlled—Kai’s perceptual signature filters every detail (e.g., “geometric precision” of map-folding). Prose rhythm modulates with ascent: shorter sentences at climactic reveals, lyrical flow in reflective beats. Diction stays within servant’s lexicon—no register drift. Goggles function as both tool and metaphor without head-hopping or exposition. Voice remains singular, intimate, and precise under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances character, plot, or atmosphere. Figurative language (“sun scattered in every crystal”) serves mechanics, not ornament. Zero loops or scaffold; syntax varies naturally (e.g., participle openings for motion, fragments for revelation). Final paragraph’s cadence crystallizes theme without redundancy. Minor deduction only for one slightly ornate phrase (“fractured into prismatic arrays”), but clarity never falters.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms “found diary” trope through optical encryption tied to environment and object. Emotional specificity—captain noticing Kai’s humming—grounds high-concept mechanics. Risk-taking (reverse chronology, dual-script diary) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular: grief and joy coexist in ice and ink. Premise would collapse with generic substitutions—every element is irreplaceable.</comment>
