<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—her heartbeat-counting ritual, tactile engagement with ink and shard, and trauma-rooted vigilance feel specific and consistent. Her motivation (to extract wisdom from failure) drives concrete micro-choices: pouring ink, tracing patterns, pressing the shard to the screen. The ghost-mirror realization emerges organically from her actions, not epiphany. However, the emotional arc leans slightly toward tidy resolution; the cost of her clerical death feels underexplored beyond symbolic resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the error isn’t erasure but a “crack that let her see the ghost’s truth,” reweighting failure as pedagogy. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the ink patterns, shard pulses, and static-to-silence progression deepen stakes through sensory layering. Cost is legible in the cold shard and earned stasis of her final heartbeat count. Orientation anchors firmly by line 3 (“opal observatory,” “she,” “midnight”), and the single-scene scope fits Track A perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The opal dome, snow, server room, and ink plate form a cohesive micro-setting that constrains choice: the dome’s fragility mirrors her status, the ink’s ephemerality demands immediacy, and the shard’s pocket-weight enables the climax. Sensory details (“air tasted of old circuits,” “porcelain shard pulsed”) are selective and POV-filtered. The setting charges the final image—snow as “quiet curtain” over her restored rhythm—fulfilling the 9+ gate via object-as-setting (shard) and environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—validating her unlived life through the ghost’s code—is signaled early and tightens when the ink patterns demand active interpretation. Her agency drives escalation: choosing to trace, press the shard, and reinterpret failure. Cost is felt in the shard’s post-climax coldness and her irreversible knowledge. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens via sensory density (static → hum → whisper → chime), though the ghost’s resolution borders on convenient without clearer tactical struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the shard’s fracture echoing data fragmentation, heartbeat syncing with machine rhythm. The ending reweights “failure” as a map without moralizing—the ghost’s final line (“each crack teaches the path to mend”) feels earned by her tactile labor. Subtext thrives in silence (radio static clearing) and gesture (pocketed shard). Ambiguity lingers: is the ghost real or projection?—but the emotional truth of resilience remains unshaken.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled first-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature: synesthetic (“air tasted,” “ink spread like nerves”) and tech-poetic diction (“splintered code,” “defragmentation”). Syntax modulates under pressure—shorter clauses during tracing, lyrical flow in reflection. No head-hopping; the ghost’s voice is diegetic (terminal output). The prose embodies her fractured-yet-methodical mind, especially in peak beats (“pressed the porcelain shard against the terminal screen”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “frozen thought,” “ephemeral patterns... spread like nerves,” “heartbeats... a note of restored rhythm” avoid cliché. Sentences vary in length and structure, with strong verbs (“rose,” “shattered,” “resonating”). Minor overwriting in “thousand echoing bits that needed to be defragmented”—slightly redundant—but no loops or scaffold. Figurative coherence is maintained (ceramic/digital fracture metaphor), and the closure image (“wisdom settle like ink drying”) lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis: bureaucratic death + digital ghost + porcelain shard creates a fresh take on resurrection myths. The “clerical death” premise avoids melodrama through specificity (sterile email, hospital database sync). Risk-taking in lyric structure pays off—the ink method could feel gimmicky but is grounded in her desperation. Every element feels necessary; removing the shard or heartbeat motif would collapse the thematic spine. Voice and concept cohere as singular artistic vision.</comment>
