<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s internal contradiction—duty versus dance—is embodied in physicality (“calloused feet,” “dancer’s grace”) and resolved through micro-choices (offering her palm, swaying ashore). Her transformation feels earned, though the guardian’s dissolution slightly shortcuts the emotional cost of unlocking a “guarded heart.” The final renunciation of cargo work for dance carries visible opportunity cost. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira’s skiff dancing “atop the crests, bound for a horizon without chains” crystallizes her new stance with legible cost—abandoning the dock life. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via recurring motifs (whale song, scrimshaw glow, sublittoral fringe) until the island’s retreat reweights freedom as fluid motion. Orientation anchors firmly by line 2; causality remains tight despite lyrical pacing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The scrimshaw functions as micro-setting, constraining choice (unlocking the guardian’s heart) and charging the final image (warm against her chest). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (“salt-laced air,” “silver ribbons over jagged rocks”), filtered through Mira’s dockworker-dancer POV. Spatial choreography stays coherent from crates to skiff to vanishing shore. Only minor deduction: the floating island’s mechanics remain vague but serve thematic resonance over realism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freedom through self-embrace—is signaled early and deepens when the whale’s call compels Mira to detach the rope, foreclosing her dock life. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens: each tactile interaction with the scrimshaw or sea tightens pressure toward dance. Cost is felt (“fortress of duty” abandoned) though not materially dramatized beyond emotional shift. Coincidence (whale call) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the choice to follow remains hers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: strength and softness coexist, unlocked not by force but “gentlest calls.” The scrimshaw’s glow and island’s pulse reweight violence-as-impossible into a metaphor for internal barriers. Final image—Mira dancing on the tide—answers the central question non-literally, avoiding moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture (“combative tenderness”) and setting (vanishing shore as liminal self).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: rhythmic, oceanic syntax mirrors Mira’s dancer-body (“moved like a dancer among the crates,” “arms tracing arcs”). Perceptual signature prioritizes texture and motion over exposition. No head-hopping; single POV remains stable even during lyric compression. Diction stays within dockworker-poet lexicon—no register drift—even in peak beats like the guardian’s dissolution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: sentences vary rhythmically, with strong verbs (“untangled,” “dissolved,” “sway”) and concrete nouns (“whalebone,” “skiff,” “brine”). One minor flaw: “floating mound of sand and shadow that defied maps” edges toward abstraction, but immediately grounded by “stepped ashore.” No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; closure beat (“world... sang with her”) resonates without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms post-war utopia trope through specificity: violence impossible not by decree but treaty, making emotional locks the new frontier. Scrimshaw as heart-key feels fresh due to tactile handling and cost (freedom requires relinquishing duty). Risk-taking in lyric structure pays off—mosaic shards (dock, skiff, island) taught early, cohere at closure. No derivative echoes; vision feels singular.</comment>
