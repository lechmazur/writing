<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete, contradictory, and embodied—her assumptions are armor she strips away physically and mentally. Her micro-choices (discarding gear, rewiring by intuition) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: abandoning her identity as amplifier for listener. The mentor’s dying words aren’t just backstory but active pressure shaping every calibration attempt. No diagnostic label-speak; even her epiphany (“seed,” not “message”) emerges through tactile rewiring, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shard reweights silence from void to fertile ground, transforming the tower’s purpose. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens via sensory and conceptual density (moss-grooved steel, hush as presence), culminating in a cadence shift at the single perfect tone. Cost is legible: Mira’s tears are “practical,” marking the death of her old interpretive self. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3; lunar perigee tightens causality without coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The abandoned radio tower city isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint and resource. Moss in ladder grooves, gorge’s “hungry” depth, copper wires remembering purpose—all shape Mira’s choices. The body functions as micro-setting: lunar pull on her bones mirrors cosmic tides, making gravity a tactile collaborator. Final image of “hundred dark towers waiting” charges closure by implying scale of transformation rooted in this specific ruin. Every detail filters through her signal-interpreter POV—no tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decoding the impossible signal—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes silence isn’t empty. The meaningful tightening occurs when she discards amplifiers, narrowing options to bare wire and crystal. Agency drives escalation: her choice to listen, not transmit, forces the tower’s harmonic resonance. Cost is felt in her emptied mind and practical tears—foreclosing her old role as interpreter to become a teacher of listening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: endings contain beginnings, silence holds creation. No moralizing—the insight arises through rewiring circuits, not stating it. The final image (teaching Tower Twenty to listen) reweights all prior abandonment as necessary compost. Subtext thrives in gesture: grease-blackened hands, dormant shard, starlight work—all embody patience as voltage. Ambiguity lingers (will others hear?), but the cost of transformation is undeniable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is singularly Mira’s: technical yet poetic (“serenely electric,” “geometry of patience”), with rhythm modulating under pressure—short, precise clauses during rewiring; lyrical flow in revelation. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices frequencies, grooves, voltages, not generic beauty. No head-hopping; focalization stays tight within her knowledge. Prose as character: syntax mirrors her shift from analytical (“calibration failed”) to intuitive (“copper sang”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“hush,” “seed,” “geometry”) and pays off without muddle. Zero paraphrase loops; varied syntax avoids drumbeat rhythm. Minor deduction: “practical relief” slightly risks label-speak but is immediately grounded in “pressure release valve for the soul.” Final line (“waiting for someone to discard enough assumptions”) perfectly echoes opening moss-grooves, closing the sonic circuit.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis: celestial interpreter meets Hollywood star fragment in a dead radio city—a trope transformed by grounding in signal-tech pragmatism. “Shard of hush” reframes silence as active medium, not absence. Risk-taking (abandoning amplification) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision coheres fully: fantasy practicality makes cosmic concepts tactile. No derivative echoes; specificity (lunar perigee affecting bone and circuit) feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
