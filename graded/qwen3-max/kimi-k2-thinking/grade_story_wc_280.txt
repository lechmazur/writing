<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ghost’s motivation—craving one more ovation—is consistent and emotionally grounded, and his choice to gift his encore to the actress feels earned. The young actress’s despair and renewal are embodied through breath, voice, and posture rather than abstract labels. However, her internal contradiction (desire vs. despair) is implied but not dramatized in simultaneous impulses; she shifts too cleanly from hopelessness to resolve. The ghost’s agency drives the arc, but the human character’s transformation leans slightly on received emotion rather than micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the actress reclaims the stage, the ghost finds purpose, and the timeline mends “just a little”—a conceptual cost made tangible by the winking-out coin. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: echoes, colors, and fruit intensify into a synesthetic symphony that reweights possibility. Orientation is clear by line 30 (“empty hall,” “stage ghost,” “decades ago”). The fractured timeline isn’t causal but functions texturally, and the final image crystallizes stakes without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mystic orchard functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image: its chiming petals, glowing fruit, and hidden location directly enable the ghost’s ritual. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered—gold/violet applause, glass-bell petals—and evolves with the ghost’s actions. Spatial choreography is coherent from theater to maze to garden. However, the setting doesn’t constrain a difficult choice; it facilitates rather than pressures, missing the 9+ gate requiring environmental constraint on agency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—luring possibility from despair—is signaled early and deepens when the ghost witnesses the actress’s rehearsal. The meaningful tightening occurs when he flicks the tarot coin, intertwining timelines to offer her his echo; this act forecloses his solitary longing. Cost is felt: his purpose is fulfilled, implying release or dissolution (“translucent smile reflecting… his purpose fulfilled”). Escalation is driven by the ghost’s agency under an Accumulative lens, though the actress’s role remains reactive, slightly softening the pressure’s reciprocity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: art’s legacy lives through transmission, not permanence. The final image—the actress carrying his echo in future ovations—offers a non-literal answer to whether greatness can be reignited. Subtext thrives in silence (her pause), gesture (steady voice), and object (the winking coin). No moralizing; resonance arises from the orchard’s promise that “possibility could always be lured back,” weighted by the ghost’s quiet sacrifice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: synesthetic color-sound mapping shapes diction (“applause that painted the darkness in hues of gold and violet”). Prose modulates rhythm—longer sentences for atmosphere, shorter for action (“He raised the tarot coin… flicked it”). POV remains tightly focalized through the ghost until the shared climax, then briefly dips into the actress’s sensation without head-hopping. No register drift; elevated diction fits the lyrical mode and is pattern-taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“petals that chimed like glass bells” conveys sound, texture, magic), but occasional overwriting dilutes propulsion: “synesthetic symphony, colors swirling around the actress like a gentle storm” risks mixed metaphor. No paraphrase loops, but three adjacent sentences begin with “He…” during the coin ritual, creating minor cadence drag. Final paragraph avoids sentimentality, though “rising nostalgia that healed” edges toward abstraction. Overall clarity remains high, but peak beats carry slight figurative bloat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of ghost lore, synesthesia, fractured time, and theatrical legacy feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes (haunted stage, magical garden) are transformed by specific rules: echoes as color, timeline shards as harvestable fruit. The tarot coin’s shifting symbols and the orchard’s role as emotional battery show conceptual integrity. Risk-taking (non-causal structure, dual focalizers) heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, though the fractured timeline remains more decorative than mechanistic.</comment>
