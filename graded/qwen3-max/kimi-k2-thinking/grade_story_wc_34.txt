<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The balladeer’s motivation—to articulate the ghost’s unspoken needs—is consistent and emotionally grounded, driving her use of the bolt plate and voice. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; she acts with near-unbroken resolve, reducing psychological complexity. The scribe’s emergence feels more thematic than character-driven, functioning as echo rather than independent agent. Final renunciation (vanishing) carries cost but reads as inevitable rather than earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the ghost’s code becomes a living language that transcends the courtyard, reweighting silence into song with conceptual cost—voices are lost yet persist. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density increasing via layered glyphs, mist, and voices until the final dissolution. Orientation is clear by line 2 (“misty courtyard above the clouds”), and the pattern of encoding → singing → release is taught early and paid off precisely at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The “misty courtyard above clouds” functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: it isolates the balladeer, suspends time between lightning/thunder, and later dissolves as stakes resolve. The flower press bolt plate acts as tool-as-setting, its physicality charging key actions. Sensory detail is vivid but leans heavily visual; touch and sound emerge only mid-story. Final image—luminous ghost drifting upward—is charged by prior atmospheric logic, fulfilling the 9+ gate condition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—giving voice to the unspeakable—is signaled early and deepens when the scribe joins, expanding the ghost’s reach beyond the courtyard. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: stamping glyphs, singing, pressing the bolt plate again—all narrow options toward liberation. Cost is unmistakable: the balladeer vanishes, sacrificing presence for permanence of the song. Thunder and storm provide external pressure, but the tightening is internal—choice to amplify pain into poetry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme—silenced voices demand articulation—emerges organically through action, not assertion. The final image reweights all prior glyphs: graffiti isn’t vandalism but scripture, silence isn’t absence but latency. No moralizing; resonance comes from the scribe’s raw voice adding “fresh threads,” implying cyclical renewal. Complexity endures: loss remains (balladeer gone), yet hope persists in drifting code—avoiding sentimentality while honoring ache.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: narrator notices wind-whispers, shimmering glyphs, mortar-seepage—filtered through poetic urgency. Rhythmic control excels under pressure: short clauses during thunder (“the courtyard trembled”), lyrical flow in calm. No head-hopping; dual focalizers (balladeer then scribe) switch cleanly at paragraph break, unified under Hybrid lens ending. Diction stays within plausible lexicon—“tinkersong wonder” feels earned, not imposed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: “graffiti roses, each petal a cipher” does setting, symbol, and plot work. Minor overwriting in peak beats—e.g., “ghost in code surged forth, no longer a whisper but a choir”—edges toward abstraction but doesn’t obscure causality. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final third avoids artifacts, though “luminous echo above the clouds” slightly softens closure’s edge with vagueness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>“Ghost in code” transforms spectral trope into linguistic haunting—fresh synthesis of graffiti, cryptography, and balladry. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over plot) heightens stakes: every glyph risks erasure, every note defies thunder. Vision coheres singularly—metal, mist, memory fuse without gimmickry. Premise would collapse if swapped: this exact blend of bolt plate, cloud-court, and tinkersong is irreplaceable.</comment>
