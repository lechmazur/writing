<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motivation—preserving hope through quiet attention—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies under pressure. Her interiority is concrete (“luminous regret,” “pocket now empty”), avoiding diagnostic labels. The river stone anchors her emotional arc, and her final renunciation (sacrificing the stone, part of herself) is earned with visible cost. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. loss) coexist without resolution, deepening her humanity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shadow transforms into a luminous guardian, preserving hope at personal cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through recurring images (stone, shadow, footage), culminating in a cadence shift at metamorphosis. Cost is legible in the final image: “heart full of luminous regret.” Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The blooming library functions as micro-setting and tool: its glass-and-steel petals, floating above clouds, constrain action (only accessible at dusk) and charge the climax (its aura dims, then glows anew). The river stone—a tactile anchor—constrains choice and reweights the ending. Sensory detail is selective (amber clouds, cool stone, silent videos) and filtered through the noticer’s twilight vigilance, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving the shape of hope—is signaled early and tightens when the shadow feeds on that hope. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: her analysis of footage reveals the threat, and her use of the stone transforms it. Cost is unmistakable (“piece of oneself” lost), though the tightening occurs more through accumulation than causal narrowing. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the stone’s power is foreshadowed, not convenient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: hope endures only when bound to loss. The river stone’s transformation—from memento to catalyst to absence—reweights memory as both burden and key. Final image offers non-literal answer: the library blooms, but warmth is “bittersweet,” rejecting tidy optimism. No moralizing; subtext lives in gesture (“pressed the stone into the shadow’s path”) and resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature fixated on twilight thresholds and silent archives. Syntax modulates under pressure—longer sentences for reflection, shorter for action (“she pressed the stone”). POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping. Diction stays within the noticer’s lexicon (“softly deliberate,” “fraying like old film”), avoiding register drift or committee voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“petals of glass,” “shadow unbound”) and pays off at closure. Minor overwriting in “luminous veil that draped over the library”—slightly ornamental—but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops, scaffold, or syntactic monotony; rhythm varies naturally across beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise (“world after dreams became shareable”) is fresh, grounded in specific stakes (archive footage, stone as earth-memory). Tropes (guardian, transformation) are reweighted through texture: hope has “shape,” shadows “feed,” regret is “luminous.” Risk-taking (silent videos as narrative engine, passive protagonist whose power is attention) heightens thematic coherence without gimmickry. Vision feels singular, not templated.</comment>
