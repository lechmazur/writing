<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is vividly rooted in her profession and trauma, with interiority rendered through embodied perception (“calloused fingers,” “heart a drum”). Her obsessive drive intensifies credibly into action, culminating in a meaningful shift from remembrance to restoration. However, the epiphany arrives with slight over-articulation (“Legacy's burden transformed from weight to compass”), bordering on diagnostic label-speak without immediate embodied cost. The final choice feels earned but leans on conceptual clarity over visceral struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (film strip, diaries, ivy) until the closure crystallizes as Conceptual Repricing: walls dream in the language of human action. Cost is legible in Mira’s emotional burden (“pressed against her ribs like shrapnel”) and the societal silence purchased by suppression. The pattern is taught early (first paragraph), escalates via discovery, and resolves in Charged Poise—“Remember, but act”—with irreversible commitment. Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage functions as micro-setting, constraining access and shaping mood; frost-vine hybrids and cracked ceilings ground the post-climate-shift world. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—Mira notices sonic fossils, not generic ruins. The film negative’s development in “red dark” ties environment to theme. However, while atmospheric, the setting doesn’t actively foreclose options or enable tactics beyond mood; it charges the final image but doesn’t *constrain* a choice, missing the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—giving voice to suppressed knowledge—is signaled early and tightens when Mira discovers the climatologist’s silenced formula. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to develop the negative, compile findings, and send the report. Cost is felt (“shrapnel” of legacy, inherited guilt) and visible in her physical reactions. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens via textual density rather than causal turns, satisfying requirements. No false resolution; stakes remain urgent yet focused.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: legacy isn’t passive inheritance but active reclamation. The film strip’s equation becomes “seed crystal,” reweighting prior despair into potential. Subtext thrives in margins—shadow-writing, half-burned pages—avoiding moralizing. Final line (“Remember, but act”) offers non-literal answer to the central question without stating a thesis. However, slight redundancy in phrasing (“legacy’s burden” appears four times) edges toward thematic echo, preventing 9.0+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled first-person limited, with perceptual signature centered on sound and texture (“sensitively perceptive fingertips”). Voice modulates rhythmically—from lyrical description to urgent revelation—without head-hopping. Diction stays within Mira’s lexicon (no academic intrusion). The prose compresses time effectively (“That night…”, “She spent weeks…”), taught early as part of her cartographic process. Minor flaw: occasional filter verbs (“she could feel,” “she understood”) slightly dull immediacy in mid-text.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “frost-vine hybrids,” “emulsion cracked like dried riverbed”). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. However, repetitive phrasing appears: “sensitively perceptive” used three times verbatim, and “half-burned diaries” recurs four times with minimal variation—constituting synonym churn. These loops, especially near closure (“Through the half-burned diaries, she glimpsed…” twice), trigger a −0.4 deduction. No mixed metaphors or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The corridor echo cartographer is a fresh synthesis—sonic archaeology meets climate elegy—with specific mechanics (mapping time via mortar frequencies). Tropes of post-collapse salvage are transformed through occupational authenticity and emotional specificity. The film negative as talisman avoids cliché by integrating math, erasure, and hope. Bold risk: prioritizing textural accumulation over plot, which heightens thematic resonance without sacrificing clarity. Final reconfiguration (“walls dream in the language of human action”) feels inevitable yet surprising.</comment>
