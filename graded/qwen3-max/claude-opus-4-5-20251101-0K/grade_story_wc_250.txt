<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The guardian’s interiority is embodied through precise, character-specific actions—turning the dental mirror, angling shutters—rather than abstract grief. Her silence feels earned, not performative, and her micro-choices (e.g., directing light to the boy’s chest) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost. The brother’s backstory is anchored in tactile detail (dentist, mirror) and tilts her present stance without therapy-speak. Her final endurance—continuing vigil—is credible stasis shaped by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she foregoes speech yet affirms witness, crystallizing her role with felt cost (seven years of silence, unspoken confession). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens via patterned light/shadow until the canal’s “hungry” whisper softens, reweighting darkness as canvas. Cost is legible in the final image: stars replace artificial constellations, but she remains alone. Orientation is immediate (“cobalt dock,” “guardian,” “brother drowned”), and the single scene coheres tightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, rain-pooled planks, and iron mooring posts function as micro-setting that constrains choice: she uses warped wood and shutters to create light patterns, turning environment into language. The dental mirror—a tool repurposed from grief—charges the final image when it beams onto the boy’s heart. Weather, water tension, and spatial choreography (dock’s end vs. boathouse) guide every action. Sensory detail is selective, POV-filtered, and never stalls momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preventing another drowning through silent empathy—is signaled early and tightens when the boy appears “hunched against something heavier.” The guardian’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to weave light, transforming passive vigil into active intervention. Cost is unmistakable—she risks reopening her wound to reach him, yet gains only a wave, not salvation. The stillwater tension sharpens the moral calculus: intervene without words, or let darkness claim another.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: light on water teaches that darkness enables beauty, not negates it. The final image—real stars replacing shutter-made constellations—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: how to live with half-spoken secrets. No moralizing; resonance accrues via the mirror, shutters, and canal’s shifted voice. Complexity endures—she doesn’t “heal,” but finds purpose in guarding the almost-drowned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable, intimate third-person limited, filtered through the guardian’s perceptual signature—she notices dental precision, light angles, water tension. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer, lyrical sentences for memory; clipped phrases for action (“She did not call out”). Voice is distinct—“spiralingly calm,” “bruise healing under rain”—without register drift. No dialogue avoids pitfalls; silence itself becomes voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “water pooled between the warped planks, each puddle holding fragments of the overcast sky” does setting, mood, and metaphor in one breath. Figurative language is coherent (light as language, darkness as canvas), never muddled. Sentence openings vary; paragraphs breathe with rhythm. One near-loop (“spiralingly calm” appears twice) slightly dulls uniqueness, but closure remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms the “grieving guardian” trope through specificity: a dentist’s sister using a dental mirror to redirect light, shutters as semaphore, cobalt dock as liminal space. The core concept—silent empathy as active resistance to despair—feels fresh because it’s enacted, not declared. Risk-taking (no dialogue, accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration—that some secrets are completed by how we live with them—is inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
