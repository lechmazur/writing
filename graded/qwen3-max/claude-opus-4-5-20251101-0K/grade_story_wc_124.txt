<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is precise and embodied—her aromatically cautious nature shapes perception and action without diagnostic label-speak. Her motivation (to understand her grandmother’s grief) intensifies credibly through sensory cues, culminating in a renunciation that forecloses emotional avoidance with visible cost: tears she no longer fights. The vial and lantern function as extensions of her psyche, not props. Final choice—to carry the vial forward—is earned by prior causality and layered with generational weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren’s stance shifts from fear to acceptance, crystallized in the final image of dawn and the vial against her heart. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—scent memories accrue pressure until the Silphium bloom triggers irreversible recognition. Cost is legible: inherited grief made bearable but not erased. Orientation anchors firmly by line 3; no disorientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges every beat—the extinct flora, UV lamps, and crystal shadows aren’t backdrop but active forces shaping Maren’s emotional arc. Sensory hierarchy reflects her profession and trauma: smell dominates, vision narrows to amber and violet light. Final image (dawn breaking over “one fewer extinction”) ties setting directly to thematic closure. Environment reweights meaning without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding scent-triggered grief—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: Maren chooses to uncork the vial despite lifelong caution. The tightening occurs when she inhales the oil, forcing confrontation with ancestral memory. Cost is unmistakable: tears, vulnerability, and the irreversible knowledge that “every scent was a ghost.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of scent, extinction, and inherited trauma—never stated, only embodied. The final image (vial preserved “for whoever might need them next”) offers a non-literal answer: memory as legacy, loss as continuity. Avoids moralizing; complexity lingers in the tension between preservation and release. Recurrence of “crystal shadows” reweights the premise without tokenism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinctively lyrical yet controlled, with a perceptual signature rooted in Maren’s aromatic caution—she notices scents before sights, textures before abstractions. Syntax modulates under pressure: shorter clauses during the vial’s opening, fluid cadence in reflection. No head-hopping; single POV held with disciplined psychic distance. Prose-as-character: rhythm mirrors botanical precision and emotional restraint.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density—nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is purposeful (“cathedral of glass and regret,” “ghost-traces of smell”) without muddle. Minor redundancy in “transformation” phrasing (lines 4 and 9), but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters slightly with “aromatically cautious still”—a near-filter—but clarity and resonance remain intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms familiar tropes (extinct plants, inherited objects) through specific, grounded choices: Silphium’s historical weight, the broker’s profession, the biological plausibility of scent-memory linkage. Emotional truth supersedes novelty—grief isn’t solved but integrated. Risk-taking in lyric structure pays off: the Accumulative design feels inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes; vision coheres as singular artistic stance.</comment>
