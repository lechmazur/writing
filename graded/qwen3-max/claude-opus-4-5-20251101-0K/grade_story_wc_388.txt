<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s motivation is consistent and compelling—her identity as a truth-seeker drives every action, from reconstructing letters to stealing the diamond. Her interiority is concrete (“hands trembled… not from fear, but from the weight”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The story earns her final choice through prior causality, though the lack of interpersonal pressure limits relational stakes. A minor deduction for the absence of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Maya’s realization reframes the entire post-collapse world, with clear conceptual cost (“every death… hinged on keeping this secret buried”). The Causal lens holds tightly—each discovery logically leads to the next. Orientation is immediate, and the stillpoint threshold provides a decisive physical/emotional pivot. Cost is legible in the final image: truth becomes seed, not salvation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The orchard isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint and catalyst. Radiation, dust storms, and the inexplicable windbreak shape Maya’s movements and discoveries. The diamond’s burial site and the Geiger counter’s silence charge the climax. Sensory detail is selective (glowing apples, lead cloth, paper grain) and filtered through Maya’s professional gaze. The setting directly enables the final thematic turn: poisoned earth can heal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus control—is signaled early and tightens when Maya crosses the stillpoint threshold, foreclosing ignorance. Her agency drives escalation: reassembling letters leads to excavation, which leads to theft. Cost is unmistakable: she carries the burden of world-altering knowledge into a hostile wasteland. The Consortium’s off-stage presence exerts coherent pressure without resolving conflict conveniently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: hoarded truth vs. scattered seeds of liberation. The orchard’s grotesque abundance reframes radiation not as death but as transformable energy—mirroring Maya’s mission. Final image (“watch what grew”) offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids binaries; the Consortium is wrong, but redemption requires action, not just revelation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person-limited POV is stable and sharp, with a distinct perceptual signature—Maya notices paper grain, ink consistency, radiation thresholds. Voice modulates under pressure: sentences shorten during storm sequences, expand during reflection. No head-hopping; all knowledge stays bounded. Prose rhythm supports tension, though one or two descriptive passages slightly dilute immediacy without harming closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and controlled, with high information density (“roots drinking deep from contaminated soil,” “fracture… like a frozen lightning bolt”). Sentence variety supports momentum; paragraph cuts feel intentional. Minor overwriting in the diamond description (“something shimmered that wasn’t quite light”) edges toward abstraction but doesn’t obscure clarity. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; closure line resonates without flourish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis: radioactive orchard as living archive, flawed diamond as biological key. Tropes (post-apocalypse, conspiracy) are grounded in specific mechanics (stillpoint physics, letter-reassembly tradecraft). The moral calculus feels fresh—salvation isn’t a weapon but a replicable process. Bold risk in making the climax intellectual (reconstruction, realization) rather than violent, yet stakes remain visceral. Vision coheres fully without retreat.</comment>
