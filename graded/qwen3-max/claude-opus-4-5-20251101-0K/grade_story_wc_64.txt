<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s blithe acceptance of death is embodied through her gardening and grave-tending, not stated abstractly. Her interiority—rooted in tactile memory and emotional calibration—feels specific and consistent. The final decision to dig tomorrow emerges credibly from her patience and observational skill, with cost implied in the weight of inheritance. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions (detachment vs. devotion) operate simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the cemetery’s meaning shifts from resting place to archive, reweighting fifteen years of labor. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—starlight, threads, echoes accrue into revelation. Cost is legible in Mira’s charged poise: she now bears responsibility for what lies beneath her flowers. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 30; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt silo functions as micro-setting: its height, metal surface, and starlit platform constrain action (climbing, cross-legged sitting) and charge the final image (stars as tapestry). Sensory detail is selective—velveteen gloom, cold metal, brass case—and filtered through Mira’s gardener POV. The sovereign case and tapestry fragment act as tool/object-setting that directly enable the decoding. Midnight-blue paint ties setting to name and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deciphering her grandmother’s hidden message—is signaled early and deepens when the border resolves into coordinates. The tightening occurs in Mira’s realization that the answer was under her care all along, foreclosing ignorance as an option. Cost is felt in the weight of the case and the burden of discovery, though not yet paid physically. Agency drives escalation: untangling is active, not passive reception.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: meaning persists in threads of cloth, light, and blood; the dead speak through coded remnants. The final image—stars as an untamable tapestry—offers a non-literal answer to the central question about intention and legacy. Avoids moralizing; embraces ambiguity (“endings are beginnings in different clothes”) without sentimentality. Epiphany is earned through tactile labor, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: lyrical but precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors Mira’s patience (long sentences for reflection, short beats for action). Perceptual signature filters everything through a gardener’s attention—roots, soil, flowers, hands. No head-hopping; single POV maintained with psychic distance calibrated to plausible knowledge. Figurative language (“velveteen gloom,” “cupped hand beneath the cosmos”) is consistent and character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Syntax varies purposefully; paragraph lengths modulate rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Minor figurative density in peak beats (“tapestry of stars”) is pattern-taught early and pays off at closure. Final line resonates without overstatement: “that was exactly as it should be” earns its quiet authority.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms familiar tropes (weaver’s secret, buried truth) through specificity: the tapestry border as coordinate system, the cemetery gardener as decoder. Emotional truth grounds the conceit—Mira’s competence feels lived, not contrived. Risk-taking (accumulative structure, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Premise would collapse with generic substitutions; irreplaceable details bind logic and lyricism.</comment>
