<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Yara’s motivation—driven by incompleteness rather than guilt—is nuanced, embodied, and consistent. Her micro-choices (handling the geode, restarting calculations) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interior contradiction is vivid: she seeks control over chaos yet clings to fragile symbols of loss. The final renunciation (continuing the hunt despite futility) is earned with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Yara’s decision to persist crystallizes stakes and reconfigures meaning without resolution. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of quantum metaphors and sensory detail intensifies toward the spike detection. Cost is legible in the geode’s transformation from “intangible” to “unbearably real.” Orientation anchors are immediate and sustained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating observatory functions as micro-setting: its isolation and failing systems directly pressure Yara’s choices. The geode and viewport are tactile anchors that evolve in meaning. Clouds “resembling brain tissue” subtly mirror her cognitive struggle without overt symbolism. Final image—purple light scattering on walls—charges closure through object-as-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding unused potential to reframe trauma—is signaled early and deepens via the third anomaly detection. Pressure tightens through system failures and time constraints, forcing repeated risk. Agency is clear: Yara chooses to recalculate despite emotional toll. Cost is felt in her trembling hands and the geode’s weight—no coincidence resolves tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: quantum anomalies as metaphors for unresolved grief. The geode’s hollow beauty mirrors how loss shapes meaning. Final lines reweight premise—unused potential ≠ wasted hope—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (breath fogging glass, unspoken wedding memory), resisting tidy redemption.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: scientific lexicon fused with lyrical grief (“stars should have been visible”). Syntax modulates under stress—shorter sentences during console beeps, fluid cadence in reflection. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent even in dense metaphor. Prose embodies Yara’s fractured consciousness without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense but precise: “tasting copper and ash,” “clouds churned in patterns that resembled brain tissue.” Minor overwriting in “perturbation equations scrolled… each variable representing…” slightly slows momentum. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances character or atmosphere. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors thematic resignation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantum theory and survivor trauma avoids cliché. The “unfiltered awakening” reframes PTSD as ontological rupture. Bleak exhilaration as tone is specific and sustained. Risk-taking (scientific jargon woven into lyricism) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight—wedding fire to cosmic hunting is emotionally and conceptually cohesive.</comment>
