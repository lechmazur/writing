<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is rooted in scientific rigor and moral urgency, with embodied contradictions—her “cautiously hopeful” plan balanced against bone-deep fear. Her micro-choices (welding the door shut, broadcasting uncertainty) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest through physical sensation (“hum in her teeth, her bones”). The final renunciation—enduring isolation to spoil the harvest—is earned and carries visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mira forecloses communal unity by acting alone, bearing the cost of alienation so others may heal. The Causal lens holds—each beat follows from prior choices (isolation → transmitter build → broadcast). Orientation is immediate (“basement of Harrington Hall”), and the 47-minute clock tightens pressure. The signal’s decay and faltering procession show decisive change with conceptual cost: the tricksters are repelled, but the community’s trauma remains.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The basement setting functions as both tomb and fortress, its burnt coffee and electronics shaping Mira’s tactical choices (welded door, salvaged transmitter). The oscilloscope and charts aren’t backdrop—they’re tools that constrain and enable action. Final image (“reflection ghosting across the screen”) charges the setting with thematic weight: she’s become part signal, part sentinel. Sensory detail (subsonic hum in liquid eyes) merges environment with embodiment without overwriting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preventing cosmic manipulation through human discord—is signaled early and escalates via Mira’s agency: she doesn’t block but corrupts the signal. The tightening (Dean’s demolition order vs. 47-minute window) forces a trade-off: save the station or sabotage the broadcast. Cost is legible in her solitude and the community’s lingering fracture. Pressure coheres under Causal lens; coincidence (door bursting at 11:58) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the work is already done.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: weaponized certainty vs. disruptive curiosity as antidotes to polarization. No moralizing—the final silence “most human sound” reweights the premise without stating it. Subtext thrives in contrasts: Aldridge’s candles vs. Mira’s oscilloscope, mathematical sequences vs. emotional dissonance. The tricksters as “farmers” reframes invasion as exploitation, making the ethical calculus specific and resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Mira’s astrophysicist perception (“crimson annotations,” “gravity lens near Proxima Centauri”). Voice modulates under stress—sentences shorten during broadcast, diction sharpens (“Frankenstein creation,” “psychic energy of a society tearing itself apart”). No head-hopping; even crowd reactions are heard through headphones, maintaining focal integrity. Rhythmic control peaks in the counter-frequency sequence, where syntax mirrors signal modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “burnt coffee and old electronics, a fitting tomb” establishes tone economically. Figurative language is purposeful (“bone snapping” for division) and coherent. Minor scaffold in “three weeks ago... now” transition, but no loops or register drift. Final line (“silence that followed was the most human sound”) crystallizes theme without overstatement. Read-aloud rhythm varies effectively, especially in the climactic broadcast paragraph.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic horror and campus politics—tricksters exploit ideological polarization rather than demand worship. The subsonic frequency as emotional vector feels novel and grounded in real science. Mira’s solution (broadcasting uncertainty) flips sci-fi tropes: knowledge isn’t power, nuanced emotion is. Risk-taking (quiet climax, no physical confrontation) heightens stakes by focusing on cognitive warfare. Premise avoids derivative “chosen one” arcs through specificity of method and cost.</comment>
