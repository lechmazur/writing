<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—grief swallowed like poison, memory as tactile sediment—and her micro-choices (climbing, listening, preserving the label) reveal a hierarchy of values forged in erasure. Her transformation from trusting documents to trusting “the texture of memories” feels earned, with visible cost in lost identity and social death. Contradictory impulses coexist: she seeks truth yet hides; collects stories but remains nameless. The final decision to confront the doctor emerges organically from accumulated pressure, not exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: she stands above the rising tide, armed with fragments, ready to speak “with the voice of someone who had already died.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—fragments layer like sediment, culminating in a reconfigured stance. Cost is legible in her erased name, vanished husband, and bureaucratic void; the tide literally covers her passage, symbolizing how truth is submerged but not destroyed. Orientation anchors immediately (“woman who should have been dead,” shipping containers, low tide), and causality flows through overheard dialogue that tightens stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The port’s labyrinth of containers functions as both setting and micro-setting: it constrains movement (climbing during high tide), supplies resources (eavesdropping perches), and mirrors thematic erasure—cargo forgotten, people disappeared. Sensory detail is selective and urgent: rust, salt, corrugated steel, sodium-orange light—all filtered through her grief-altered perception. The environment directly charges the final image: from above, the maze reveals its pattern “designed to lose things,” yet she knows its passages. This spatial knowledge becomes her power, making the setting indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the truth behind her husband’s disappearance and her own falsified death—is signaled early and deepens when she hears the men reference “the Meridian shipment” and “same poison notation.” The tightening occurs through her agency: she layers fragments into evidence, then resolves to confront the doctor. Cost is unmistakable: she lives as a ghost, stripped of legal identity, surviving only through whispered truths. Pressure escalates via overheard dialogue that connects her personal loss to a systemic cover-up, raising stakes from grief to survival against institutional murder.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: official records erase lives, but memory—fragmented, tactile, collective—preserves truth. The recurring image of layered fragments builds to a resonant final answer: monuments to the erased are built not in stone but in “the irreducible weight of remembered lives.” No moralizing; insight arises from her method of listening and preserving. The story resists tidy resolution—it ends not with justice, but with poised resistance—embracing ambiguity while affirming that lived experience outweighs bureaucratic fiction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered entirely through her altered perception. Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors tidal ebb and flow (“She had learned to breathe with it”). Syntax compresses under pressure (“She held her breath”), then expands in reflection. Dialogue is sparse but naturalistic, carrying subtext (“Third one this month… same signature”) that advances plot without exposition. No head-hopping; even the men’s conversation is heard through her ears, reinforcing her isolation and method.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is consistent (“layer these fragments like sediment,” “bureaucratic acid”) and never muddled. Minor deduction for slight overuse of metaphor in mid-text (“monuments to forgotten shipments”), but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s cadence—“collecting new fragments… building monuments”—resonates without redundancy, closing the tidal rhythm with earned lyricism.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesizing bureaucratic erasure, maritime mystery, and sensory historiography into a fresh narrative mode. The “presumed dead” trope is transformed by grounding it in global trade’s shadow economy and a woman’s tactile epistemology. Risk-taking—accumulative structure, unnamed protagonist, passive vengeance through memory—heightens stakes without gimmickry. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight: only someone erased could navigate a system designed to lose people, and only fragments could rebuild what documents destroyed.</comment>
