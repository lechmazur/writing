<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Helena’s motivation—driven by obsession with digital erasure—is embodied in micro-choices (lying to Security, pocketing the drive) and tied to a flaw (her inability to accept loss). Her internal contradiction (seeking truth while risking her safety) intensifies under pressure. The Artemis-7 patch and “brightly attentive” trait shape decisions with visible cost. Final action feels earned, not impulsive, and aligns with her established moral calculus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Helena steps into the night “to run,” crystallizing her stance with legible stakes and conceptual cost (truth vs. safety). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—patterns (7-14, songs, fragments) intensify until the final reconfiguration. Cost is embedded in the image of stars as “distant servers,” linking personal mission to systemic horror. No causality breaks; every discovery tightens the narrative coil.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The missile silo setting functions as micro-setting: its isolation enables Helena’s nocturnal investigations and constrains access to restricted data. Sensory details (humming servers, unbidden audio fragments) are filtered through her professional attention and emotional state. The Artemis-7 patch and Nevada night charge the final image. Environment actively shapes tactics—she must physically enter the vault—and mirrors thematic concerns of buried truth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering what Nexus hides—is signaled early and deepens when Helena finds Marcus’s message. Her lie to Security is a decisive tightening that narrows options and raises personal risk. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: each discovery (shadow profiles, geolocation data) compounds danger. Conceptual cost (complicity vs. exposure) is unmistakable in the closing lines, where running becomes both literal and existential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme—digital permanence as testimony—emerges organically through images (fragments, numbers, patch) rather than assertion. The final image reweights deletion as survival: “deleted files never really went anywhere. They waited. They accumulated. They testified.” No moralizing; ambiguity lingers (Will she succeed? At what cost?). Central question (“Where do deleted files go?”) receives a resonant, non-literal answer rooted in character action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled first-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature: Helena notices patterns, metadata, echoes. Voice modulates under stress—shorter sentences during the vault breach—but retains rhythmic control. Compression is purposeful (e.g., backstory woven into present action via the patch). No head-hopping; diction stays within her plausible lexicon (“algorithmic detritus,” not corporate jargon). Final line’s lyricism feels earned, not imposed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “servers humming like mechanical ghosts,” “birthday songs, lullabies, drunken karaoke” layer sensory specificity with thematic weight. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with tension. One minor redundancy: “forgotten songs played on” appears twice, slightly dulling the final echo. No scaffold loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms surveillance tropes through grounded detail: the corporate memory keeper role, Artemis-7 patch, and recurring numbers feel specific, not generic. Risk-taking (accumulative structure, quiet climax) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Premise avoids fads by tethering digital haunting to human absence. Final synthesis—deleted data as witness—feels inevitable yet fresh, with emotional truth outweighing surface novelty.</comment>
