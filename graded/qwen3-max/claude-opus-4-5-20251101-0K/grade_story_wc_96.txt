<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s molting identities are embodied through tactile memory (sorting books, handling the tin) rather than diagnostic labels, and her contradictions—fierce Vera vs. soft Delia, yet all loving Ezra—are active in scene. Her final choice to continue rebuilding despite uncertainty is earned by prior causality: each personality leaves traces that cumulatively affirm commitment. Ezra’s presence pressures her stance without resolving it, preserving cost. The only flaw: minor flattening in the “all of them love Ezra” line risks summary over embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira’s unknown future self will still return, crystallizing options under moonlight with rusted shelves as testament. Cost is legible in the fragility of seventeen poems and patrols hunting them—resistance persists precisely because it’s invisible to power. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via recurring images (tin, stars, rust) until the final reconfiguration (“blooms in fractures”). Orientation anchors instantly (“rusted library had no roof, only stars”), and the pattern pays off without disorientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: patrols overlook it because “rusted things are invisible,” enabling sanctuary. Concrete details—prison-bar shelves, circulation desk remnant, moon-clearing skyline—integrate with action (sorting by starlight) and charge the final image. Sensory specificity (luminous cracked laugh, Earl Grey sachets) filters through Mira’s trauma-honed attention. Only slight overreliance on visual at climax prevents a 9.5.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving dangerous ideas through fragile beauty—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: Mira chooses to rebuild despite identity flux, rationing tea to protect poems. Escalation occurs when Ezra arrives with “dangerous” philosophy, tightening pressure as patrols hunt them; their silent sorting becomes defiance. Cost is unmistakable: the false-bottom tin’s secrecy, the risk of capture, the emotional toll of molting. Coincidence never resolves; survival hinges on their choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: resistance as daily acts of curation (books, poems, tea tins), not manifestos. The final image—“shelves held together by friendship and rust”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to destruction: hope thrives in fractures. Avoids moralizing; complexity lingers (regime collapsed prisons, yet patrols persist). Recurring motifs (bloom/salt earth, rust/invisibility) accrue meaning without tokenism, reweighting chaos as fertile ground.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices dust, spines, seams—librarian’s precision fused with fugitive vigilance. Rhythmic control under pressure: short clauses (“She adds the book to its shelf”) amid lyrical cadences (“stars poured through the gaps like witnesses”). Elision is taught early (molting explained in one breath) and paid off in closure. Dialogue feels natural (“Philosophy section’s about to get dangerous”) with subtext; Ezra’s penny-poet idiom contrasts Mira’s tactile focus without convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density: “water-damaged Thoreau” conveys history, humor, and stakes in three words. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“Mira discovered,” “She remembers,” “The coffee tin sits”). Figurative language is precise (“fractured light through broken glass”) without muddle. Minor deduction for one slightly purple phrase (“luminous and cracked”) in peak beat, but propulsion remains taut. Final line’s repetition (“Always together. Always under stars.”) is purposeful cadence, not scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: prison-library meet-cute transforms into post-collapse resistance via mundane objects (coffee tins, prison bars). Molting identity as survival mechanism avoids cliché by tying it to tactile continuity (book-sorting hands remember). Bold risk: quiet ending where resistance is curation, not combat—heightens stakes by making fragility the point. Irreplaceable details (penny poet smuggling sonnets on napkins) root universals in specificity. No derivative echoes; premise feels inevitable yet surprising.</comment>
