<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her grace is “staggering” yet unfeigned, her strategic patience coexists with desperation. Her micro-choices (decoding keys, appealing to the scout’s hunger) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The scout’s internal war is rendered with minimal but precise gestures, avoiding caricature. Both characters feel like individuals shaped by their world, not archetypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira descends into the vault, emerges with seeds and arrow, and walks toward dead zones—options reconfigured, cost felt (chains remain, wall collapses). The causal lens holds: every beat follows from prior choices (decoding → code entry → confrontation → escape). Time pressure tightens options cleanly, and the scout’s choice alters trajectory without coincidence resolving stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The carnival prize center isn’t backdrop—it supplies the piano, bench, keys, and spatial logic for decoding; dust motes and broken toys mirror Mira’s trapped hope. The setting constrains action (shackled hands fumbling in bench) and charges closure: she exits past falling wall into dead zones, seeds vs. rubble. Sensory detail is selective, urgent, and filtered through Mira’s mission-driven perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—saving seeds before demolition—is signaled early and escalates via time pressure and scout confrontation. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she decodes, enters code, persuades. Cost is unmistakable: chains remain, vault will be buried, and she risks everything for a slim chance. The scout’s moral dilemma sharpens the ethical calculus without diluting focus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: unclaimed toys, resilient seeds, synthetic-feathered arrows. No moralizing—resilience is shown through action, not stated. Final image reweights premise: chains bind body but not mercy; dry soil becomes site of liberation. The seed vault reframes freedom as cultivation, not just escape—a non-literal answer to “how do you free a dying world?”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled single third, with Mira’s perceptual signature shaping every image (“keys yellowed like old teeth,” “dust motes swirling”). Voice modulates under pressure: lyrical in reflection, terse in crisis. Dialogue is sparse but distinct—the scout’s “You’re a terrorist” contrasts Mira’s grounded rebuttal. No head-hopping; psychic distance remains consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: “elephants with matted fur, bears missing limbs” conveys decay economically. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, accelerating during scout confrontation. One minor flaw: “staggering grace she didn’t feel” edges toward diagnostic phrasing, but is redeemed by immediate physical context. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; every line advances plot, character, or atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-apocalyptic resistance fused with agrarian hope, encoded in musical keys amid carnival detritus. Tropes (liberator in chains, seed vault) are transformed by specificity—synthetic-fletched arrow, alkaline-tolerant wheat, prize redemption as metaphor. Risk-taking (lyric decoding, quiet climax) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular, not templated.</comment>
