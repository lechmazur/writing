<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her exhaustion, reverence, and tenderness feel lived-in, not diagnostic. The boy’s grief is rendered with restraint yet depth, his flickering presence charged with emotional truth. Their interaction reveals contradictory impulses (Mira’s duty vs. compassion; the boy’s need to be heard vs. fear of being too quiet) without tidy resolution. The vial cork functions as both object and emotional filter, grounding abstract longing in tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira’s quiet stewardship crystallizes into active mentorship, reweighting the story’s central claim—that listening sustains light more than shouting. Cost is legible: the boy’s spectral fragility implies impermanence, and Mira accepts the burden of temporary care. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with scent, color, and silence building to a final image that reconfigures meaning without mechanical resolution. Orientation is immediate and precise: cobalt lighthouse, post-heat wave, dawn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse isn’t backdrop—it breathes, casts shadows, and houses the flame Mira tends; its color mirrors emotional exhaustion. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: jasmine scent signals supernatural summons, salt-stiff clothes convey journey, cool stone contrasts heat trauma. The setting constrains choice (only here can the boy manifest; only here is someone listening) and charges the final image—descent into ordinary sea air marks transition from magical summons to human tending. Micro-setting (vial cork, lamp housing) integrates seamlessly with atmosphere and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—being heard when you speak softly—is signaled early and deepens through the boy’s arrival. Pressure escalates not via external threat but through emotional vulnerability: his confession at the funeral tightens the thematic knot. Mira’s agency drives escalation—she chooses to kneel, to offer her hand, to invite him into ritual. Cost is felt: she takes on the weight of a ghost-child’s grief, knowing his form is transient. The stakes remain viscerally intimate, never abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the lighthouse beam (shout) vs. Mira’s attendance (whisper), the boy’s silenced mourning, the cork that purifies muddy intentions. No moralizing—insight arises through action (beckoning without words) and image (flickering fingers held alongside worn cork). The ending reweights the premise: true communication isn’t volume but resonance, and some messages arrive in broken children. Ambiguity lingers (is he ghost or wish?), enriching rather than confusing the core question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled, first-person limited to Mira’s sensory and emotional field. Voice is lyrical yet precise—“paint the exact color of exhaustion,” “eyes that held too much ocean”—with rhythm modulating to match ascent (burning legs) and descent (fading garden scent). Dialogue is sparse but potent; the boy’s cracked whisper contrasts Mira’s calm certainty, revealing classless authenticity. No head-hopping, no register drift; even elevated diction (“resonant reconfiguration” implied, not stated) feels earned by her reflective vocation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is consistent (bruise, prayer, ocean eyes) and never muddled. Sentence variety supports momentum—longer cadences for reflection, shorter for revelation (“He nodded”). Minor deduction for slight overuse of metaphor in opening paragraph (“bruise,” “exhaustion,” “fallen prayers”), but it serves orientation and tone without obscuring clarity. Final line resonates without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms the lighthouse trope from beacon of warning to vessel of reception; the real light is attentiveness. “Vibrations of intent” could feel gimmicky, but here it’s grounded in grief, grandmother lore, and sensory logic (scent as signal). Risk-taking—ghost-child summoned by quiet desperation—heightens emotional stakes without sacrificing coherence. The synthesis of occupation (keeper), object (cork), and concept (whispers travel farther) feels inevitable in hindsight, specific to this voice and coastal solitude.</comment>
