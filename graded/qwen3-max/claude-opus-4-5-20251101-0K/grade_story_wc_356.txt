<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s olfactory sensitivity and ambition are embodied throughout, driving her actions and shaping her perception of the corpse flower. Her internal contradiction—seeking stillness yet needing motion—is credibly rendered through micro-choices (e.g., forcing herself to inhale the stench). The final renunciation of staying in Canopica feels earned by her experiential arc, not declared. Thessaly functions effectively as a pressure character without overstepping the single-POV scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Mira reweights “serenity” from a place to a practice, with the cost being her relinquishment of the village’s literal peace. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story deepens through sensory density and pattern recognition (village-as-flower), culminating in a Charged Poise ending where options are crystallized (“serenity isn’t here… it’s in how I move”). Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Canopica’s treetop architecture constrains and reflects Mira’s journey—platforms “woven through ancient branches” mirror the “hidden geometries” she sketches, and the setting directly enables the central conflict (access to the bloom). Sensory specificity (resin, smoke, decay) is filtered through Mira’s olfactory POV, avoiding tourist cataloging. The corpse flower’s physical presence charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—attaining wisdom through confronting repulsion—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes death feeds life. The tightening occurs during her two-night vigil: enduring the stench becomes the price that transforms her understanding. Agency is clear (she chooses to stay, to breathe, to leave), though escalation leans more on accumulation than causal narrowing. Cost is felt but not sharply visible beyond emotional transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Mira’s confrontation with the corpse flower: wisdom resides in embracing contradiction, not resolving it. The final image—carrying the seed into the world below—offers a non-literal answer to her quest, reweighting “stillness” as dynamic integration. Avoids moralizing; insight arises from concrete experience (sketches evolving from monstrous to geometric). Resists tidy binaries—repulsion and attraction share roots.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices through scent first, then geometry, then emotion. Voice modulates rhythmically—longer, lyrical sentences for observation; terse phrasing during visceral stress (“eyes watered from the stench”). Free indirect style is clean, and diction stays within herbalist lexicon (“spathe,” “resin”) without academic drift. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density: “decay wrapped in sweetness” conveys smell, theme, and foreshadowing in five words. Syntax varies purposefully—fragments for impact (“Days passed in wildflower hush”), complex sentences for immersion. One minor paraphrase loop (“journalizing and sketching” repeated), but no scaffold or filter-verb stacks. Final line (“serene within her motion”) resonates without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: the corpse flower—a real botanical oddity—becomes a vehicle for philosophical inquiry without veering into allegory. The treetop village avoids fantasy cliché through tactile detail (rope ladders, bark-rough hands). Risk-taking in structure (accumulative, not causal) heightens thematic resonance. Premise transcends template via Mira’s specific sensory worldview and the doodling method.</comment>
