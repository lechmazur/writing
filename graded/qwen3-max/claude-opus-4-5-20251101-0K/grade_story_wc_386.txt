<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief, precision, and moral calculus feel lived-in, not diagnostic. Her micro-choices (e.g., deciding to expose the truth despite knowing the harbormaster’s father is dead) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The ghost whisperer role isn’t a label but a lens that shapes perception and action. Final renunciation—choosing acknowledgment over revenge—is earned by prior causality and charged with emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elise’s death is reframed from accident to theft, reweighting history with social cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the dreams accrue like photographic evidence until the pattern breaks with revelation. Cost is legible in Mira’s burden (“She would give her forty-three”) and the shrine’s return to silence. Every beat tightens toward this reconfiguration without causality breaks or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The glacier shrine functions as both setting and micro-setting: its ice thins the veil, enabling connection, and its candlelight filters starlight into narrative metaphor. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—amber shadows, crystallizing breath—never decorative. The snow globe’s warped glass and warm resin charge the final image. Environment directly constrains Mira’s method and culminates in the closing motif of filtered, secondhand light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth as salvage, not vengeance—is signaled early and deepens when Mira uncovers sabotage. Escalation is driven by her agency: analyzing dreams, tracing patterns, choosing exposure. The cost is felt in the harbormaster’s inherited guilt and Mira’s solitary burden. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens; coincidence (dream overlaps) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the climax hinges on Mira’s interpretation and decision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: memory in ice, ghosts in margins, truth as fragile as warped glass. Subtext operates in silence—the unspoken pact between Mira and Elise, the village’s collective guilt. The ending offers a non-literal answer: recognition, not punishment, is the pure thing salvaged. No moralizing; resonance arises from the snow globe’s warmth and stars “filtered through frozen water and the dreams of strangers.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is exquisitely controlled—lyric but precise, with a perceptual signature that notices light through ice, grief in dream margins. Syntax modulates under pressure: shorter clauses during revelation (“The truth was a knife”), flowing cadence in reflection. No head-hopping; single POV remains stable. Diction stays within Mira’s lexicon—no register drift, no filter-verb stacks. Final line’s rhythm crystallizes the theme without strain.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“borrowed starlight,” “window of connection”) and pays off in closure. Zero loops or scaffold; high information density (“faces half-glimpsed in crowds that shouldn't exist”). Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts heighten tension. No overwriting—metaphors serve causality, never blur it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms ghost story tropes through specificity: wreck-diver ghost whisperer as forensic empath, ice as memory medium. The moral calculus—absolution over justice—is non-obvious and rooted in character. Risk-taking (mosaic dream shards, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular: a fusion of maritime folklore, psychological depth, and glacial lyricism that avoids template plots.</comment>
