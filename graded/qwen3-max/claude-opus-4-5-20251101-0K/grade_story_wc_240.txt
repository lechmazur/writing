<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya’s spatial gift and grief are embodied with precision—her micro-choices (kneeling, pressing the laser) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interior contradiction pulses between her professional detachment and visceral longing. The final weeping feels earned, not cathartic release but permeable acceptance. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through bioluminescent optics and fungal membranes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “becoming permeable enough to hold everything” reweights the entire premise with emotional cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via luminous thresholds until the final image crystallizes stakes. Orientation anchors instantly (“mushroom farm,” “Maya,” “before dawn”). Cost is legible in the dog’s whimper, unread journals, and unlearned names.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The bioluminescent farm isn’t backdrop—it constrains every choice. Mycelial barriers dictate Maya’s path; ghost mushrooms model spore-teleportation as metaphor for letting go. Sensory hierarchy reflects her spatial gift: she notices negative spaces, not generic glow. Final image (“quiet wildfire of impossible colors”) charges closure by fusing setting and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding “physics of letting go”—tightens when Maya realizes permeability > rupture. Her agency drives escalation: using the laser to map barriers, then choosing to contact David’s partner. Cost is felt in hollow spaces of their relationship and the dog’s recognition. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves anything.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through fungal membranes—not stated but enacted. The final CR (“becoming permeable enough to hold everything”) reweights absence/presence without moralizing. Subtext thrives in what’s unsaid: unread notebooks, unlearned names. Avoids sentimentality by grounding epiphany in mycological mechanics (“spores through thin membranes”).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: Maya sees networks as architecture, grief as optical refraction. Rhythm modulates—longer sentences for reflection, staccato beats for action (“She pressed the button”). No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained (she can’t know David’s partner’s thoughts). Voice remains consistent even in lyric passages (“light that moved through barriers as easily as grief”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose avoids loops/scaffolds; every sentence advances character or atmosphere. Figurative language is coherent (“quiet wildfire,” “captured starlight”) and tied to POV lexicon. Syntax varies purposefully—fragments for tension, flowing clauses for revelation. Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors permeability: clauses breathe through barriers like spores.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via mycological specificity—permeable barriers aren’t metaphor but fungal reality. Synthesis feels inevitable: spatial gift + intrusion detection + bioluminescence = physics of letting go. Bold risk (lyric science) heightens stakes without gimmickry. No template echoes; voice, concept, and closure cohere as singular vision.</comment>
