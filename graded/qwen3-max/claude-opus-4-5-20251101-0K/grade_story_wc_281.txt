<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya’s affectionate skepticism is embodied in precise micro-choices—kissing the coin while citing correlation ≠ causation—and her somatic markers force contradictory impulses (doubt vs. bodily certainty). Her trembling hands shift from mediated signal to authentic emotion, crystallizing a credible endurance that forecloses passive waiting. The final decision to follow Daniel’s pathways emerges organically from established traits and prior causality, with clear emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Maya’s illuminated name reconfigures static shock from accident to signal, with conceptual cost (the pill’s true purpose = control) legible in Daniel’s journal. The Causal lens holds tightly—each discovery follows from somatic feedback and embodied action, not coincidence. Orientation anchors instantly (“darkened studio,” “three weeks”), and the hidden panel reveal pays off early spatial familiarity without telegraphing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The light-painting studio functions as micro-setting: fiber-optic wand traces fractal grief/joy, cold wall hides Daniel’s seam, mica slivers catch amber light—all constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy narrows under stress (tingling palm > visual cues), and tools are handled with tactile specificity. The muscovite’s layered structure mirrors both theme and character, avoiding symbolic convenience by grounding metaphor in physical interaction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (“illuminate hidden pathways”) tightens decisively when Maya discovers the company sells control, not telepathy—foreclosing trust in institutions and forcing solo pursuit. Protagonist agency drives escalation: somatic markers guide her to the panel; her choice to read, not flee, deepens knowledge. Cost is unmistakable—the flushed pills represent lost safety, and Daniel’s absence weighs on every tremor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: somatic markers as truth-tellers vs. corporate lies, fractal light as resistance to linear control. The final image—“golden fire” spelling Daniel’s name—offers non-literal answer: connection persists beyond surveillance. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers (Is Daniel safe?), but resonance is earned via mica slivers and bodily epistemology.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Maya notices layered mica like “frozen thought,” maps emotions to joints, sees light as branching spirals. Rhythmic control modulates with pressure—longer sentences for reflection, staccato phrases during discovery (“Cold. / Her fingers found the seam”). POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping, and elision (Daniel’s fate) serves closure rather than obscuring it.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose avoids loops/scaffold: each sentence advances plot or character (“The body didn’t lie the way the mind could”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“fractally precise” → light spirals → journal patterns) and payoff-integrated. Minor density in peak beats (“fragile and luminous as light through willowglass”) borders on ornamental but earns its place by charging tone. No register drift or syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise transforms telepathy tropes via somatic epistemology and light-painting as resistance. The muscovite geode sliver—an obscure mineral—is irreplaceable, tying geology to memory. Risk-taking (bodily intuition over tech) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable: static shock rewires not just pills but narrative itself toward embodied truth.</comment>
