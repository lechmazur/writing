<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation—to find beginnings in endings—is embodied through precise micro-choices: discarding filters, reversing amplification, stripping assumptions. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion manifests as tactile sensation (“fragment of hush... settle around her shoulders like a cloak”). The Hollywood star fragment functions as a personal totem whose warmth signals emotional resonance, not exposition. Final weeping feels earned, not sentimental, because it emerges from sensory overload rather than abstract epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the final image reweights silence as generative rather than empty, with undeniable cost (“recorded only shadows,” “strange peace” implying prior isolation). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—density builds via sensory and conceptual layering until the moon’s perigee triggers a cadence shift into cosmic reception. Orientation anchors (who: Mira; where: Voxhaven spire; when: lunar perigee) are clear by line 30. Every beat tightens toward the climactic tuning, with no causal breaks or retroactive patches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voxhaven isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains tactics (rusted ladder, corroded console) and charges closure (towers “finally learned to listen”). Sensory hierarchy reflects Mira’s profession: she notices electrical charge before visual detail, texture before sound. The gorge’s mist and moon’s proximity aren’t decorative—they enable the signal’s arrival. Final image (“towers caught the first light”) transforms setting from tomb to sentinel, fulfilling the 9+ gate via environmental reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decoding cosmic silence—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes human engineering assumptions block reception. Her agency drives escalation: discarding filters, reversing amps, rejecting “words” as necessary for communication. Cost is legible: her recordings capture “only shadows,” implying lifelong limitation despite breakthrough. Lunar perigee acts as a live clock that narrows her window, making failure plausible until the final hum.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action, not assertion: “endings were not walls but doors” crystallizes via Mira’s technical choices, not narration. The Hollywood fragment’s anonymity mirrors the story’s rejection of named fame in favor of potential—a motif that pays off when it warms during cosmic reception. Final paragraph reframes transmission itself as universal process (“broadcasting on channels the universe was still learning to tune”), offering non-literal resolution without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers (will interpreters understand her findings?), resisting tidy closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-limited, filtered through Mira’s professional lexicon (“celestial signal interpreter,” “amplification cascade”) and poetic sensibility (“serenely electric,” “shard of hush”). Syntax modulates under pressure: short clauses during technical work (“She removed the filters... reversed the amplification”) contrast lyrical flow during revelation. No head-hopping; even cosmic transmissions are rendered through her perception (“felt it settle... heard everything”). Voice remains distinct from generic lyricism via concrete occupational grounding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose balances density and propulsion: “gorges yawned like a mouth that had forgotten how to close” establishes voice immediately without overwriting. Figurative language is coherent (silence as “cloak,” towers as “skeleton”) and peaks cleanly at climax (“shard of hush descended... weight and presence”). Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor deduction for one slightly elevated phrase (“serenely electric”) that borders on abstraction but earns its place through repeated anchoring in physical sensation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hard sci-fi (signal interpretation) and mythic longing (anonymous fame, cosmic silence). Avoids tropes by grounding “magic” in practical labor—Mira’s success comes from rewiring hardware, not mysticism. The “shard of hush” concept feels inevitable in hindsight because it grows from her technical struggle and philosophical stance. Bold risk: making silence the climax’s sensory payload, which could fail without meticulous buildup—but here it lands with emotional and conceptual precision.</comment>
