<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—scars as dream-cartography, roots as both prison and purpose—and her final choice to anchor the bridge feels inevitable yet costly. Her contradictory impulses (root-bound vs. visionary) act simultaneously in scene, not summarized. The seven supplicants are individuated through scar-maps that reveal distinct unconscious journeys without head-hopping or flattening. Her micro-choice to press the clipping into soil crystallizes her renunciation of solitary vision for collective passage.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the door of shadows emerges, dawn breaks beyond, and Mira’s rootedness transforms from constraint to covenant—foreclosing solitary prophecy with visible cost (she stays while others cross). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dream-scar patterns intensify until they rebuild the maze and manifest the intersection. Cost is legible in “roots strained against their earthly anchor” and the final line’s earned sacrifice. Orientation anchors instantly (“cobalt glade,” “Mira,” “dusk”) and disorientation serves closure (reality bleeding at edges).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt glade functions as micro-setting: its roots bind Mira, its twilight summons scar-glowing pilgrims, and its soil regrows the maze from the clipping. The topiary clipping constrains the climax—it must be planted to rebuild the labyrinth—and charges the final image as the shell enclosing the circuit of scars. Sensory specificity (“bruises and promises,” “hummed like a tuning fork”) filters through Mira’s visionary bias without tourist cataloging. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite eight bodies: scars call across the clearing, hands link scar-to-scar, maze closes “like a protective shell.”</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—accessing the dream-intersection—is signaled early and tightens when the covenant breaks, making paths collide. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she calls the seven closer, reads their scars, and plants the clipping, which rebuilds the maze per their combined unconscious. Cost is unmistakable: her rootedness becomes permanent anchoring duty (“Someone had to hold the door steady”). The deepening—collective dream-landscape now reachable by earthbound—narrows options to “together or not at all,” crystallizing stance under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through scar-cartography and root-bound sacrifice: truth resides where private dreams intersect, but accessing it demands embodied cost. The ending reweights prior material non-literally—the clipping’s regrowth isn’t restoration but co-creation; Mira’s imprisonment becomes generative. No moralizing; resonance arises from “letting others grow from [her] roots” as dawn breaks beyond the door. Ambiguity lingers (will they return? what lies beyond?) without confusion, embracing complexity over tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Mira notices scars as maps, twilight as “bruises and promises,” roots as cultivated tethers. Rhythmic control modulates with pressure—longer sentences for vision-weaving, short clauses for command (“Come closer”). Free indirect style blends seamlessly (“She was a root-bound visionary, they called her”), and diction stays within her lexicon (“anxious elation,” “purposefully curious”). No head-hopping; even the seven are rendered through Mira’s scar-reading lens, maintaining single-POV integrity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “reality bled at its edges” advances atmosphere and concept; “roots erupted… weaving with the ones already tangled” shows causality and embodiment. Minor figurative density in high-pressure beats (“door made of overlapping shadows”) doesn’t obscure clarity. No loops or scaffold—each sentence earns its place. Final line’s cadence (“they would meet it dreaming”) recharges “dreams have geography” without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise transforms tropes: the “chosen one” is root-bound not by curse but preparation; the maze regrows via collective unconscious, not magic. Emotional specificity avoids templates—scars as dream-evidence feel fresh yet inevitable. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure, lyric closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The synthesis—scar-linking as cartography, topiary as bridge—feels singular and irreplaceable, with conceptual integrity fully committed to its dream/waking dialectic.</comment>
