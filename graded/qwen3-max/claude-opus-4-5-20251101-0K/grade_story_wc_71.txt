<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marina’s motivation as a “creeping normality noticer” is embodied through precise micro-choices—moving objects, touching walls, naming dust—that reveal her internal hierarchy of values. Her epiphany about attention as sanctification feels earned, not diagnostic, and avoids therapy-speak. The interior contradiction between passive observation and active witnessing crystallizes in her decision to keep returning. Final renunciation of invisibility carries visible cost: she bears the weight of memory alone.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Marina redefines “sanctification” not as ritual but as witnessed attention, with the cost being lifelong solitude in service of remembrance. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—density builds via displaced objects, sensory details, and repeated acts until the final image reweights the entire premise. The orris root shard’s return in the last line ties closure to earlier particulars without exposition. No causality breaks; every beat tightens the thematic coil.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bay setting isn’t backdrop but active micro-setting: fog, mud-scent, streetlight amber, and catkins shape Marina’s perception and pace. The Whitmore house’s “breathing” silence directly constrains her choice to enter and act. Final image—streetlights “illuminating nothing and everything”—charges the closure by reframing neglect as potential witness. Every sensory detail serves pressure or theme; no white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether abandoned places can be kept alive through attention—is signaled early and deepens when Marina realizes her grandmother was wrong. The meaningful tightening occurs at the threshold: entering the house becomes an act of defiance against creeping normality. Cost is felt in her solitude and burden, though not dramatized as loss (e.g., time, health). Agency is clear: her displacement method drives escalation, but stakes remain internal rather than viscerally tested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Marina’s actions: memory persists only through deliberate witnessing. The final image—carrying the orris root like a compass toward unseen houses—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext lives in silence, scent, and relocated objects; no prompt-like articulation. Complexity is preserved: some houses may never revive, yet the trying itself matters.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is flawlessly controlled single-third with a distinct perceptual signature—Marina notices erosion, scent, silence, displacement. Voice modulates rhythmically: longer sentences for reflection, shorter for action (“She pushed open the door”). Syntax mirrors her mind: lyrical but precise, never slipping into abstraction. No head-hopping, filter-verb stacks, or register drift; even elevated diction (“amber daydreaming”) fits her poetic sensibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“the bay held its breath in the violet hour” establishes time, mood, and personification). Figurative language is coherent and purposeful—no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in “spring unfurling around her” slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors thematic resolution: quiet, forward-moving, charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms the “haunted house” trope through emotional specificity: haunting as absence demanding witness, not ghostly presence. The “shard of hush” concept feels fresh because it’s grounded in Marina’s methodology and sensory world. Risk-taking—centering passive attention as heroic—heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Vision is singular: a quiet elegy for the unnoticed, rendered with irreplaceable detail.</comment>
