<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motivation—to learn the language of old buildings—is vividly embodied and consistently drives action, while Finch’s spectral presence and role as tutor feel inevitable rather than contrived. Their relationship functions as a crucible: the “agreed upon lies” create mutual vulnerability that deepens with each tea session. The final renunciation—accepting mentorship from a ghost—carries emotional weight and forecloses ordinary understanding, earning an Earned Stasis. Minor deduction for Finch’s interiority remaining slightly opaque, though this aligns with his ghostly liminality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Structure is taut and accumulative, anchored immediately in a specific time (Leonid meteor shower), place (rooftop garden), and character dynamic. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density, recurring motifs (seal, jasmine, meteors), and ritualized tea sessions until the climax reweights everything via Conceptual Repricing—the revelation that architecture speaks only between living and dead. Closure lands with undeniable cost: the mentor vanishes, leaving the protagonist alone with silent responsibility. The seal’s transfer crystallizes Charged Poise, making before/after legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rooftop garden isn’t backdrop but active micro-setting: jasmine scent mingles with dialogue, meteors punctuate lessons, and potted ferns frame intimacy. Crucially, the brass seal—a tool-as-setting—constrains choice by enabling translation of architectural stress into wax imprints. Final image charges the seal with legacy and loss, fulfilling the 9+ gate. Sensory detail is selective (warm wax, cool touch, starlight) and filtered through the narrator’s yearning, avoiding tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deciphering the city’s hidden language—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist dares to interrogate Finch directly, risking dissolution of their fragile pact. This act of “interrogating silence” escalates from passive listening to active confrontation, narrowing options: truth or continued pretense. Cost is felt in Finch’s fading form and the burden of solitary continuation. Escalation stems from protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the meteor shower’s peak feels slightly coincidental rather than causally earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: some truths exist only in liminal spaces between life/death, seen/unseen, spoken/silent. The final line—“a conversation that would now continue silently”—offers resonant, non-literal closure, reweighting all prior “lies” as necessary vessels for transmission. No moralizing; wisdom arises from concrete particulars (wax, seal, creaking beams). Ambiguity lingers (Can she truly hear the buildings alone?), but the emotional aftereffect—lonely stewardship—is unmistakable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable, intimate, and perceptually distinct: noticing architectural stresses, spectral transparency, meteor punctuation. Voice modulates rhythmically—from lyrical (“night etched in silver and shadow”) to sparse (“He nodded”)—mirroring emotional intensity. Dialogue is minimal but potent; Finch’s lines carry subtext (“The same reason you are”) and advance plot. No head-hopping; even Finch’s interiority is inferred through action, not intrusion. Prose as character: syntax mirrors architectural patience—measured, layered, precise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line: “light passed through him” conveys ghostliness economically; “iron bones and mortar veins” fuses anatomy and architecture. Figurative language is consistent (meteor = punctuation, building = speaker) without muddle. Minor overwriting in “masterpiece of mundane pretext,” but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s cadence slows appropriately, letting the seal’s glow and dissolving form land with quiet propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise transforms ghost-tutor trope through specificity: linguistics applied to architecture, meteor showers as celestial text, sugar-borrowing as ritual gateway. The “agreed upon lies” concept feels fresh, not derivative, and integrates fully with theme and structure. Risk-taking (ghost as grammarian, buildings as narrators) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision is singular—urban mysticism grounded in tactile detail (warm wax, brass weight)—making abstraction feel lived-in and inevitable.</comment>
