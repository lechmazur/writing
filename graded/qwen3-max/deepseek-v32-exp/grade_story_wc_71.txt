<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is rooted in consistent, sensory-driven observation and childhood memory, compelling her ritualistic action. Her interiority is concrete (“noticer of creeping normality”), and her micro-choice to place the orris root enacts a hierarchy of values—sanctifying forgotten spaces over personal safety or convention. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; she moves with near-certainty, missing friction between belief and doubt that would deepen credibility. The epiphany feels earned but leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity rather than embodied struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara reweights “aliveness” as the result of intentional displacement, not inherent spirit. The cost is conceptual—the acceptance that vitality must be actively maintained—and legible in the cottage’s sigh and warming walls. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density increasing via recurring motifs (streetlights, hush, displacement) culminating in a resonant final image. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the single-scene structure fits scope perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The quiet bay in spring isn’t just backdrop—it supplies salt air, cherry blossoms, and cobblestones that shape Elara’s perception and ritual. The orris root shard functions as micro-setting, constraining her method and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective (scent of violets and salt, golden haze) and filtered through her noticing POV. However, the environment doesn’t *foreclose* options—Elara acts freely—so it narrowly misses the 9+ gate requiring constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding why houses feel alive—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes displacement sanctifies space. The tightening occurs when she places the orris root, narrowing her theory into practice with visible consequence (the house sighs). Cost is conceptual: she accepts ongoing responsibility (“She would continue her work”). Agency drives escalation, though the absence of external opposition softens pressure; stakes remain internal yet coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: vitality requires small, meaningful disruptions to stagnation. The final image—Elara walking away as the cottage becomes a home again—offers a non-literal answer to her childhood mystery without moralizing. Subtext thrives in displaced objects (seashell, key, orris root) that accrue meaning through use, not declaration. The “inadvertently profound” insight avoids sentimentality by grounding transcendence in tactile ritual.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to gradual change (“creeping normality,” “hushed blaze”). Syntax modulates—longer, flowing sentences for reflection; shorter phrases for action (“Placing the orris root… whispered a word”). POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping. The prose teaches its own lyric pattern early (“streetlights began their daily daydream”) and pays it off in the closing image, achieving rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language (“cherry blossoms scattering like pink snow,” “hushed blaze”) is coherent and recurring. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“a shard of hush descended, not as an absence of sound, but as a presence”), slightly slowing propulsion. No loops or scaffold, but one adjacent paraphrase (“tangible quiet that wrapped… like a cloak” / “warmth emanate from the walls”) nudges score down from 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise transforms the familiar “haunted house” trope into a quiet metaphysics of care, grounded in perfumery lore and coastal specificity. Originality lies in linking displacement—not possession—to sanctification, with emotional truth overriding gimmick. The synthesis of orris root, creeping normality, and “hushed blaze” feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric abstraction in short form) heightens resonance without obscuring closure.</comment>
