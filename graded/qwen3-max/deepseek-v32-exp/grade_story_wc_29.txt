<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Aris’s motivation—to outwit cosmic tricksters—is consistent and drives his high-stakes decision to broadcast illegally. His interiority is concrete (“weary eyes,” “frantic circles” on charts), and his calm declaration to Evans reveals a hierarchy of values: truth over compliance. The cost—career risk, potential blame—is visible, and his cautious hope evolves credibly into resilient resolve. However, internal contradiction remains slightly muted; the story leans more on external pressure than simultaneous conflicting impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story operates under a Causal lens: Aris acts *because* the signal fuels chaos, *therefore* he broadcasts, *so* the signal dissolves and tensions ease. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the clean screen and quieting crowds reconfigure the station from listening post to shield, with clear conceptual cost (defying authority, risking scandal). The Orientation Test is passed cleanly by line 3. Cost is legible in Evans’s shift from fury to respect and the implied institutional fallout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The university radio station functions as a potent micro-setting: its outdated equipment enables the subsonic gambit, and spatial choreography (hunched over consoles, door swinging open) remains coherent. The astronomical charts and humming consoles are tactile, recurring objects that constrain choice—Aris cross-references them before acting. Sensory detail is selective (static hiss, bone-deep thrumming) and filtered through Aris’s professional urgency. The final image charges the setting: it becomes a “shield,” fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing societal fracture via signal manipulation—is signaled early and tightens when Aris bypasses protocols, foreclosing institutional safety. His agency drives escalation: the unauthorized broadcast directly disrupts both cosmic and terrestrial chaos. Cost is felt (Evans’s anger, career jeopardy) and visible in the quieting quadrangle. The deepening—subsonic frequencies soothing human emotions—adds layered consequence without coincidence resolving the core conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: meaning-making as vulnerability to manipulation, and responsibility as interference. The final image—station as shield, Aris as guardian—offers a non-literal answer to whether passive interpretation suffices. Subtext thrives in Evans’s recalibration and the crowds’ calming, avoiding moralizing. However, the “cosmic tricksters” premise edges toward allegory, slightly limiting ambiguity; the thematic resolution feels earned but not deeply contested.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Aris’s perceptual signature: he notices signal patterns, equipment states, and crowd noise through a lens of professional obsession. Prose rhythm modulates effectively—short, tense clauses during the broadcast, lyrical cadence at closure. Dialogue is sparse but functional, with Evans’s cold anger contrasting Aris’s calm. No head-hopping or register drift; voice remains consistent, though diction occasionally leans academic (“ethereal grit”) without full integration into Aris’s idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and generally precise (“static hissed from the speakers, a white noise sea”), with strong verbs and sensory specificity. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting appears in phrases like “ethereal grit” and “monumental risk,” which verge on label-speak. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one mixed metaphor (“white noise sea he was paid to navigate”) slightly blurs imagery. Closure beat remains artifact-free and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise transforms the “alien signal” trope through grounded stakes: not invasion or salvation, but psychological manipulation feeding human division. Aris’s role as interpreter-turned-interferer offers fresh moral calculus. The subsonic countermeasure is inventive, tying cosmic and emotional resonance. While not radically unprecedented, the synthesis of scientific rigor, community fracture, and quiet heroism feels specific and cohesive, avoiding template plotting.</comment>
