<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ghost whisperer’s motivation—to salvage purity from wreckage—is consistent and embodied through tactile actions (palming the globe, whispering truth). Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead showing contradiction via her delicate, almost ritualistic handling of volatile emotional material. However, her emotional arc lacks a decisive internal reversal; she endures rather than transforms, which is valid but undercharged for Earned Stasis. The absence of another on-page character limits relational crucible, but micro-choices (e.g., embedding dream cameos) reveal value hierarchy with subtle cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the melted globe becomes a beacon reweighting “wreckage” as a vessel of collective hope, with conceptual cost in the labor of dream-weaving. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via recurring dream fragments until the lattice sharpens into a window. Orientation is immediate (“frozen cliff,” “lantern,” “shrine”), and causality flows through pattern recognition, not brute force. The final image (sunrise after starlight solidified in veins) makes the before/after legible without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The glacier shrine functions as micro-setting that actively constrains and charges: its ice walls refract borrowed starlight into a “choir of quiet light,” directly enabling the climactic vision. Sensory detail is selective (pine-and-salt fragrance, liquid mirror, amber pulse) and filtered through the whisperer’s professional attention. The setting evolves causally—from static shrine to luminous conduit—and culminates in the final image where environment and body fuse (“starlight solidified in her veins”). No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—exposing hidden purity beneath wreckage—is signaled early and deepens via dream-lattice mapping. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: she doesn’t passively receive visions but actively weaves truth and implants final cameos. Cost is conceptual (the labor of dream-tending) and felt in the “veil thickening” tension. However, the pressure tightens texturally rather than foreclosing concrete options; no live path is visibly sacrificed, slightly muting the stakes under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: purity isn’t extracted from wreckage but reassembled from its scattered reflections in collective dreams. The ending offers a non-literal answer—the child’s dissolving key—to the central question of salvage, reweighting debris as potential. Subtext thrives in images (gull with glass shard, spinning compass) rather than statements. Avoids moralizing; complexity lingers in the unresolved tension between individual loss and communal hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: noticing fissures, filaments, and fragrances through a diver’s tactile precision. Syntax modulates under pressure—shorter clauses during the whispering climax (“The glass trembled...”)—and rhythm supports accumulation. No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon (“loom of memory,” not academic jargon). Elision is purposeful (dream mechanics compressed) and paid off via the lattice payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “borrowed starlight... painting walls with trembling silver”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (filaments, lattice, window) and coheres without muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“weave truth carefully, threading each revelation like ice filaments”) edges toward purple, but closure beat remains clear. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary effectively. Final line crystallizes motif without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story, climate imagery, and dream logic feels inevitable in hindsight. The wreck-diver ghost whisperer trope is transformed by tying salvage to collective subconscious rather than personal redemption. Bold risk: making the snow globe both relic and network node. Specificity abounds (pine-and-salt dreams, glacier shrine), avoiding generic “magic object” pitfalls. Conceptual integrity holds—every element serves the thesis that purity is relational, not pristine.</comment>
