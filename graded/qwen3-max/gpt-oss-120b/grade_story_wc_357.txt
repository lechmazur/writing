<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is consistent and embodied—her micro-choices (e.g., releasing the tip rather than keeping it) reveal values with tangible cost. However, her internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; she moves from curiosity to resolution without layered resistance or competing impulses in-scene. The epiphany about “listening to echoes” feels slightly unearned as interior struggle isn’t dramatized under pressure. Still, her competence is balanced with reverence, avoiding infallibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: resilience is redefined as rhythmic cultural practice, not just an object. The inverted-hour constraint creates a live clock that tightens decisions, and Mira’s final act—releasing the tip into the basin—forecloses personal gain for planetary renewal with visible cost (sacrificing cargo). Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: echoes, water flow, and inversion build toward a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The orchard planet’s floating arches, inverted gravity, and phosphorescent roots aren’t backdrop—they actively constrain navigation and enable discovery (e.g., upward river guides descent). The broken arrow tip functions as micro-setting, charging the final image when dissolved into the basin. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (Mira notices water glint, not generic flora), and the environment evolves causally (trees accelerate growth post-contact). This specificity earns the 9+ band under the gate rule.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the source of resilience—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes the true catalyst is cultural memory, not the artifact. The gravity-inversion timeframe forces urgency, narrowing options (only 60 minutes to act). Agency is clear: her choice to release the tip crystallizes her stance. Cost is felt (she forfeits the valuable tip) but could be sharper—what does she lose personally beyond mission parameters? Still, escalation aligns with the Accumulative lens via density of echo/water motifs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: resilience as intergenerational listening, not technological fix. The final image—tip dissolving into soil as orchard hums—offers a non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting the “broken arrow” from relic to seed. No moralizing; insight arises from action (release → renewal). Ambiguity lingers (will echoes persist?), but resonance is earned through concrete particulars like moss-veiled metal and emerald-glittering leaves.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control (“whirling silence,” “silver veins”) that modulates with pressure. POV remains tightly focalized through Mira; perception is biased by pilot expertise (noticing water flow, not botany). Syntax varies purposefully—longer sentences for wonder, shorter for action—and diction stays within plausible lexicon. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., skipping takeoff mechanics) serves momentum without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “roots swayed like kelp” conveys inversion + biology + mood). Figurative language is coherent—coral-like arches, balloon fruit—and avoids muddle. Minor overwriting in “emerald fire” verges on purple, but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s cadence (“hovering… plotted… determined”) accelerates cleanly toward next expedition, reinforcing theme without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes ecological myth and sci-fi with fresh specificity: gravity inversion as cyclical stressor, echoes as cultural memory medium. Tropes (chosen one, magical artifact) are subverted—the real magic is participatory ritual. Risk-taking (lyric structure, no dialogue, abstract “resilience” stake) heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. The transformation test passes: swapping Galdor for Earth would collapse the logic. Vision feels singular, not prompt-driven.</comment>
