<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The harmonic stone skimmer’s interiority is vividly embodied—her reverence, stillness, and sensory attunement feel character-specific rather than archetypal. Her micro-choices (waiting, lifting the arrowhead, bowing) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on listening over action. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; she moves seamlessly from observation to resolution without friction or doubt, flattening emotional complexity. This smoothness prevents full 9+ eligibility despite strong voice and motive consistency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she renounces physical navigation in favor of internal mapping, with felt cost in the “weathered resolve” and centuries of dust settling on her shoulders. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density builds via echo, pulse, birds, and stone until the final lattice crystallizes. Orientation is immediate (“mouth of the canyon,” “towers of bone”), and the pattern pays off without disorientation penalty. Cost is legible in the marrow-deep resolve and irreversible shift from movement to stillness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The canyon, towers of bone, and basalt niche aren’t backdrop—they’re active constraints that shape perception and method. The stone arrowhead functions as micro-setting, its vibrations dictating the protagonist’s entire navigation system. Sensory detail is selective (wind tracing walls, pressure waves on skin) and filtered through her historically reverent POV. Crucially, the environment charges the final image: the invisible lattice of wind and echo becomes her path, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled early and deepens when the arrowhead’s resonance aligns with the birds’ spirals, narrowing her options to pure internal attunement. Agency lies in attention and interpretation, not action, which fits the Accumulative lens. Cost is visible in the “weathered resolve” and centuries of inherited burden, though the escalation lacks a tangible trade-off (e.g., sacrificing a tool or relationship). Still, pressure coheres and tightens toward Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: stillness as motion, memory as navigation, reverence as continuity. The final image—birds gone but their lattice lingering—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: understanding replaces journeying. No moralizing; resonance accrues through concrete particulars (arrowhead glow, dust imprints, bone towers singing). The pulse’s wandering reframes time itself as a medium to be read, not traversed—conceptual repricing with quiet, earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is singular, rhythmic, and perceptually precise—every sentence filters the world through the skimmer’s attuned senses. Syntax varies purposefully: short clauses for tension (“She watched the birds”), lyrical cadences for accumulation (“centuries of layered dust”). No head-hopping; focalization remains tight and consistent. Elevated diction (“resonant reconfiguration,” “weathered resolve”) stays within her lexicon as a keeper of myths, never drifting into academic register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line: “wings cutting the thin air like knives” conveys sound, motion, and metaphor simultaneously. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every image advances atmosphere or theme. Minor overwriting in “pulse left wandering between shadow and stone” risks abstraction, but it’s anchored by immediate tactile follow-up (“brushed against her skin”). Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors the story’s cadence—still, echoing, resolved.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</question><comment>Originality thrives in the fusion of mythic restraint and sensory precision: navigation via bird-flight syllables and echo-lattices feels inevitable yet unprecedented. Tropes (ancient stones, bone towers) are transformed by the skimmer’s anti-journey—she seeks understanding, not escape. The risk of near-stasis pays off through escalating textural density, not plot. Every element coheres into a singular vision where stillness becomes the ultimate act of courage.</comment>
