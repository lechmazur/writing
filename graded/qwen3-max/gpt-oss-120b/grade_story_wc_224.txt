<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation—to understand the shape of home—is deeply personal and consistently embodied through tactile interactions with the stone and feather. Her buried talents evolve credibly from dismissed sketches to a resonant creative force, and her final choice to place the stone back on the pedestal enacts Earned Stasis with visible cost: she relinquishes direct access to memory but gains alignment with her talent. Interiority avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through sensory perception (pine resin, rain arches) rather than abstraction. However, the absence of contradictory impulses in-scene—her path is singularly focused—prevents full 9+ territory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with pressure escalating through sensory density and patterned repetition (feather, thunder, mercury glass) until the corridor unfurls—a decisive intensification. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lira realizes home is resonance, not location, and the mountain’s heartbeat slows in shared stasis. Cost is legible in the shattered childhood image and the relinquishment of the stone; the final breath “seeds” memories outward, foreclosing private retrieval. Orientation is immediate and functional disorientation (dream/reality bleed) pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The mountain-bookstore is not backdrop but active crucible: its stone ribs expand like lungs, its corridors reconfigure in response to Lira’s insight. The recurring objects—the feather, the stone, the mercury-glass book—constrain and enable action: the feather’s texture is the only viable method of reading, making it irreplaceable. Sensory detail (pine, ink, thunder-pulsed vellum) is filtered through Lira’s longing, never touristy. Crucially, the setting charges the final image: the mountain inhales as Lira exhales memory, binding environment and epiphany.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding home—is signaled early and tightens when memory becomes painful, forcing Lira to confront fracture rather than retreat. The deepening occurs when she presses the feather deeper, risking emotional rupture to unlock the hidden corridor. Agency is clear: her micro-choice to persist despite pain drives escalation. Cost is felt in the shattering of the courtyard image and the implied forfeiture of literal return; however, the absence of a second live option slightly softens the trade-off’s sharpness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of object, setting, and action: home as resonance, not fixed point, is demonstrated through the stone’s hum syncing with the mountain’s ribs. The final image—pages releasing scent instead of ink—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence: the mother’s lullaby echoes distantly, implying loss without exposition. Ambiguity lingers (Is the mountain alive? Is memory real?), but never confuses the emotional truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, with a perceptual signature steeped in liquid-metal imagery and synesthetic translation (symbols “sing” as vibrations). Syntax modulates with pressure: longer, flowing sentences during dream-walking; shorter, tactile phrases during feather-stone contact. Voice remains consistent—elevated but not academic—and every image serves Lira’s quest. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks; the prose itself embodies the “texture of a feather,” light yet precise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (mercury glass, hidden thunder) and never muddled. Minor overwriting appears in the phrase “wind‑blown pages” (slightly generic), and one adjacent pair (“towering libraries… corridors that smelled”) edges toward paraphrase-loop, but momentum remains unbroken. Final lines achieve lyrical propulsion without sacrificing clarity; the mountain “breathing with her” crystallizes the core metaphor without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of seer, stone, and bookstore-mountain feels inevitable yet fresh, transforming familiar tropes (lost language, buried talent) through specific sensory logic. Risk-taking—substituting reality nightly, reading via feather—heightens stakes without gimmickry. The premise avoids abstraction by rooting metaphysics in tactile detail (obsidian grain, skin-like vellum). While echoes of Borges or Mieville exist, the emotional specificity—Lira’s fractured courtyard—makes the vision singular and authentic.</comment>
