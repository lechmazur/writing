<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The carver’s interiority leans on abstract labels (“fiercely meditative,” “collective grief”) rather than embodied contradiction. Her epiphany about grief’s “shape” arrives without prior micro-choices that test or complicate it. The spectral mentor exerts no real pressure—only affirmation—so her final peace feels unearned. Emotional progression lacks irrationality or hypocrisy, trending toward tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early (gravestone carver in greenhouse at dusk), but causality falters: the ghost appears without motivation, triggers no meaningful turn, and vanishes after passive approval. The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, yet escalation is static—butterflies arrive, ribbon unfurls, poem recited, insight granted—without narrowing options or imposing cost. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (“shape of collective grief”), but the cost remains conceptualized, not felt or dramatized on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (mist, scent, lunar glow) and filters perception through the carver’s profession. However, it functions as backdrop, not constraint—it doesn’t shape choices or charge the final image beyond aesthetic resonance. The butterflies and headstones create mood but don’t alter tactics. Strong atmosphere without causal integration caps impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding “the shape of collective grief”—is declared but never tested through active conflict. Pressure is ambient (turmoil within, fading light) not coherent; the ghost’s appearance complicates nothing. No meaningful tightening occurs: the carver recites a poem, watches butterflies, and receives insight without trade-off or loss. Coincidence (butterflies arriving precisely at climax) resolves emotional tension rather than earned agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of grief’s persistence emerges through recurring images (butterflies, ribbon, headstones), but subtext is drowned by explicit statements like “she had finally discovered the shape of collective grief.” The final paragraph moralizes rather than resonates, violating the “no sermonizing” rule. Insights feel inherited from prompts (“spectral mentorship,” “family custom”) rather than earned through struggle. Ambiguity is absent—grief is “beautiful and terrible” in equal, unchallenged measure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose has a consistent lyric register with rhythmic control, and POV remains stable in third-person limited. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“thundering calm,” “intricate web of life and death”) that exceeds the carver’s plausible lexicon. The perceptual signature is muted—observations prioritize poetic symmetry over character-specific bias. No dialogue to evaluate, but internal voice leans explanatory over experiential.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Overwriting abounds: metaphors pile without coherence (“serene gloom,” “summer storm” for ghost, “thundering calm”), creating figurative muddle. Repetitive phrasing (“the carver felt…”, “as she…”) and paraphrase loops dull momentum (e.g., grief described as “swirling,” then “shifting like a great wheel,” then “a shape”). Final paragraph summarizes closure instead of dramatizing it, violating “show pivotal beats” rule. Sentence variety exists, but density suffers from redundant emotional labeling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Premise combines familiar tropes (ghost mentor, artisan protagonist, butterfly symbolism) without transformative specificity. The “spectral mentorship” concept echoes generic spiritual guides; the greenhouse setting feels borrowed from gothic pastoral templates. Emotional truth is obscured by ornamental detail (woven ribbon, poem trading) that doesn’t deepen moral calculus. Risk-taking is superficial—lyricism substitutes for narrative ingenuity, yielding a competent but derivative meditation.</comment>
