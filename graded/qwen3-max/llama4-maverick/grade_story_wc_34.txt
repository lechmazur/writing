<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The balladeer’s motivation—to articulate unspoken needs—is consistent and emotionally grounded, but her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in scene; she moves steadily toward expression without resistance or doubt. Her actions align with motive, yet the absence of struggle or misstep flattens agency. The final insight feels earned thematically but not causally pressured by prior choices. Interiority leans on lyrical abstraction (“tinkersong curiosity”) over embodied, character-specific perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: mist, storm, symbols, and hum coalesce into a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure—the mural remains, the courtyard is changed, and the balladeer departs with new understanding. Cost is felt (her departure, the storm’s toll) though not sharply visible; the ghost’s response carries emotional weight. Orientation is clear early (“misty courtyard above clouds”), and the pattern of encoding → response → transformation holds. However, escalation relies on atmospheric intensification rather than narrowing options through choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The “misty courtyard above clouds” functions as a charged micro-setting: its thin reality enables the ghost in code, and weather directly pressures the balladeer’s act (storm intensifies her strokes). The flower press bolt plate and stone bench are tactile anchors that evolve in meaning. Sensory detail (ozone, wet stone, charcoal scratch) is vivid and filtered through the balladeer’s drifting alertness. Yet the setting never constrains a pivotal choice—it facilitates but doesn’t force action, missing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—giving voice to the ghost’s whispers—is signaled early and deepens as the storm escalates. The balladeer’s agency lies in encoding, which tightens into frenzy under pressure, culminating in a mural that alters the courtyard’s essence. However, the ghost’s presence never opposes or complicates her goal; it merely responds, making conflict one-sided. Cost is implied (her departure, the storm’s energy) but not dramatized as a trade-off or loss that reshapes tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—creative expression as bridge between ephemeral and eternal—emerges organically through image and action, not declaration. The recurring motifs (mist, code, flower press) accrue meaning, and the final mural reweights the premise: silence can be spoken. Subtext thrives in the ghost’s hum and the balladeer’s charcoal strokes. Yet the closing line verges on thematic echo (“tinkersong wonder that would linger”), slightly undercutting earned resonance with near-labeling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: lyrical, rhythmic, and attuned to sensory texture, with a perceptual signature that notices swirling mist, etched metal, and ozone-charged air. Syntax modulates with pressure—longer, flowing sentences early give way to sharper fragments during the storm. No head-hopping; single POV is stable. Diction remains within the balladeer’s plausible lexicon, avoiding academic drift. The prose embodies her “driftingly alert” state without over-explaining, sustaining immersion throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is lush but occasionally over-ornamented: phrases like “ghost in code” and “tinkersong wonder” border on coined jargon, and figurative density peaks in high-pressure beats without pattern payoff. Minor paraphrase loops appear (“swirling mist” / “mist swirled”; “encode a message” / “messages encoded”). Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm supports mood. However, the final paragraph’s “testament to the power of creative expression” edges toward abstract telling, dulling the otherwise concrete closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of digital hauntology (“ghost in code”) with artisanal mysticism (flower press, charcoal graffiti) feels fresh and specific. The balladeer’s role as mediator—not exorcist or summoner—subverts ghost-story tropes. Risk-taking in form (accumulative lyricism over plot) heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Yet the concept leans on familiar new-age aesthetics; originality shines in execution (the bolt plate’s return, storm-synced creation) more than premise.</comment>
