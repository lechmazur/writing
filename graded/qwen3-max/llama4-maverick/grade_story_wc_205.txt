<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is richly rendered through poetic reflection and embodied sorrow, yet her transformation feels more asserted than dramatized. Her revolutionary past informs her present motivation but lacks concrete micro-choices that reveal contradictory impulses in-scene. The shard discovery prompts contemplation, not active dilemma, reducing pressure on character agency. Still, her “burnished sorrow” grounds emotional authenticity without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (shard, mirrors, sorrow) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis as chronicler. Closure lands with conceptual cost: she accepts partial truth, trading revolution for narrative stewardship. However, the storm’s rumble and time’s visibility introduce stakes never tested causally; escalation relies on atmospheric thickening, not narrowing options. The final image reweights her purpose credibly, if quietly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid functions as micro-setting: its galleries, dust, and luminescence shape perception and movement, while the shard emerges from its decay. Sensory detail is selective—facets glinting, footsteps echoing—and filtered through the protagonist’s poetic bias. The setting constrains nothing materially, but it charges the final image: the shard on the desk embodies loss and possibility. A near-miss on the 9+ gate—setting resonates but doesn’t alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reimagining a lost civilization—is signaled early and deepens through the shard’s discovery. Yet pressure remains abstract; the “heated dispute” with colleagues exists off-page, removing immediate opposition. The visible cost is emotional (sorrow), not tactical or social. The storm and time’s visibility complicate but don’t force trade-offs; agency manifests as persistence, not choice under duress. One meaningful deepening occurs, but stakes lack on-page friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the act of reconstruction as redemption, imagination as bridge across temporal voids. The shard refracts both light and meaning, evolving from artifact to talisman to symbol of rebirth. Final lines avoid moralizing, offering instead a quiet CR—her world is “beauty, sorrow, and hope”—that reweights prior loss. Subtext thrives in ritual (covering mirrors) and silence, though the colleague’s anecdote leans slightly expository.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: lyrical, introspective, rhythmically fluid, with syntax modulating between flowing clauses and stark declarations (“she was not afraid”). POV remains tightly controlled, filtering all description through the protagonist’s poetic sensibility. No dialogue dilutes focus; free indirect thought merges seamlessly with narration. Register stays consistent—elevated but not academic—and the perceptual signature (noticing glints, echoes, dust) feels character-specific and sustained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense with figurative language, occasionally bordering on overwriting (“words flowing like a river of fire”), but largely controlled. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence, and information density is high. Minor redundancy appears in repeated “reimagine, recreate, rediscover” phrasing and dual mentions of “burnished sorrow.” No fatal loops, but slight scaffold in the storm’s recurrence dulls propulsion just before closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The fusion of archaeology, visible time, and baroque asteroid creates a fresh speculative frame. “Covering mirrors during storms” introduces idiosyncratic folklore that hints at deeper world logic. While the defunct revolutionary trope isn’t new, her pivot to poetic chronicler feels earned. Risk lies in prioritizing texture over plot—a valid Accumulative choice—but the concept doesn’t fully exploit the implications of visible time beyond mood.</comment>
