<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The storyteller’s motivation—translating texture into sound—is embodied through precise, sensory-rich actions and deepens credibly under pressure. Her internal contradiction (yearning to resurrect lost languages vs. fear of oblivion) culminates in a renunciation that feels earned. The final act—hurling the diamond—reveals her hierarchy of values with visible cost: sacrificing the tool of translation to defy erasure. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through copper-veined skin, searing palms, and shattering laughter.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she endures the canyon’s demand by rejecting the diamond, crystallizing her identity as “the extinction.” The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—density builds via echoing bird cries, vibrating bone towers, and the diamond’s fracturing vein until climax. Cost is legible in the scorched palm and silent towers; the canyon’s hunger exacts payment even as she walks away steady. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no disorientation penalty applies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The canyon, bone towers, and twin moons aren’t backdrop—they actively constrain and charge every choice. The towers supply runes to resurrect; the echoes distort bird cries into usable chords; the flawed diamond’s heat sears her palm at the critical moment. Final image—silent, dark towers—reweights the setting’s meaning: not a repository of memory but a throat that consumes. Body (copper veins), object (diamond), and environment fuse into a single resonant micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resurrecting extinct languages through resonance—is signaled early and tightens when the diamond reveals its true nature as a mirror of fear. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: her humming triggers the climax, and her choice to hurl the diamond forecloses the path of translation. Cost is unmistakable—the seared palm, scattered birds, silenced canyon—but the tightening doesn’t narrow options so much as reconfigure their meaning, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: some languages are felt, not spoken—a truth earned through failed translation and bodily sacrifice. The diamond’s song lingers not as recovered speech but as internal resonance, reframing extinction as continuity. No moralizing; the final line offers a non-literal answer to the central question (Can lost tongues be reclaimed?) by shifting from recovery to embodiment. Ambiguity remains—was the song real or imagined?—but the emotional aftereffect is concrete.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is singular: lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to texture, fracture, and echo. Syntax modulates under pressure—short, staccato phrases during the climax (“The diamond burned… She laughed…”) contrast with flowing cadences earlier. POV remains tightly focalized; all description filters through the storyteller’s synesthetic lens. No head-hopping, register drift, or filter-verb stacks; prose itself performs the story’s core act—translating sensation into rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is pattern-taught (cracks as maps, echoes as voices) and pays off in the diamond’s fracturing. Minor overwriting in the climax (“tidal wave of sound,” “maelstrom”) slightly blurs causality but doesn’t obscure closure. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies purposefully, and the final line (“a reminder that some languages are meant to be felt, not spoken”) perfectly recharges the opening premise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in fusing linguistic extinction with physical resonance—a fresh inflection on preservation tropes. The cursed diamond as mirror, not prison, subverts expectation while feeling inevitable in hindsight. Worldbuilding details (bone towers, twin moons, copper-veined skin) serve theme and conflict, never ornamental. Risk-taking (lyric structure, abstract stakes) heightens meaning without gimmickry; the vision feels authentically singular, not prompt-derived.</comment>
