<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila’s interiority is vivid and specific—her curiosity, grief-work ethic, and embodied reactions (e.g., breath hitching, mist on lashes) feel authentic. Her micro-choices (kneeling, using the hearing aid, following the pulse) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over comfort, listening over speaking. The final renunciation isn’t explicit but implied in her quiet departure—she endures the emotional weight without seeking reward. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are layered (“throat tightened,” “steps lighter”) without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lila’s act crystallizes love’s endurance beyond speech, with felt cost in the widow’s tear and Lila’s chest-weight. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens through sensory density (mist, pulse, static) until the final synchronization reweights silence as communication. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“atrium,” “Lila,” “twilight”), and causality holds: every beat follows from curiosity + method. Cost is legible in the widow’s whispered “He never said it” and Lila’s earned stillness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The atrium functions as micro-setting: mist, glass dome, fountain, and galleries aren’t backdrop but active constraints that shape Lila’s movements and perception. The hearing aid—a tool-as-setting—charges the final image when pulses synchronize. Sensory detail is selective (damp moss, yellowed keys, cobwebs) and filtered through Lila’s professional attention. The environment exhales when closure lands, proving setting constrains choice and reconfigures meaning—meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—assuring unspoken love—is signaled early and tightens when the pulse proves traceable. Escalation is driven by Lila’s agency: she chooses to press the dead hearing aid to her ear, follow the thrum, and place her device beside its twin. The cost is felt in the widow’s trembling hands and Lila’s emotional burden, though not physically dramatized. Coincidence (finding identical hearing aid) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the duet is earned by Lila’s persistence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: love’s inarticulacy versus its endurance. Subtext lives in gesture—the man’s mid-gesture hand, the synchronized pulses, the single tear. The ending offers a non-literal answer: love echoes beyond words, reweighting the photograph from memento to conduit. No moralizing; resonance arises from particulars (hearing aids, algae-softened edges). Avoids sentimentality by grounding epiphany in tactile ritual.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-limited, with a distinct perceptual signature: Lila notices sonic and textural traces others miss (“static,” “pulse trapped in amber”). Voice modulates under pressure—sentences shorten during tracking, then expand at closure. No head-hopping; diction stays within her plausible lexicon (“incidental heroism” feels earned, not academic). The final line (“meant to echo”) resonates without violating voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “mist curling like spectral cats,” “bruised violet” twilight—figurative language serves atmosphere without muddle. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with action (longer during reflection, clipped during pulse-tracking). One minor loop: “persistent curiosity” appears twice, but second use ties to theme. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks; every line advances character, plot, or mood. Closure image (“last photograph tucked safely”) carries weight without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise transforms ghost-story tropes via occupational specificity (heart-tracing as grief midwifery) and tech-poetics (hearing aids as spirit conduits). The “incidental heroism” concept feels fresh because it’s enacted, not declared. Risk-taking (lyric pacing, static-as-dialogue) heightens stakes without gimmickry. No derivative echoes; vision coheres as singular—Lila’s world feels lived-in, not templated.</comment>
