<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lila’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her cautious hope, trembling hands, and quiet resolve reveal a nuanced hierarchy of values under pressure. Her micro-choices (uploading code, refusing to flinch at the voice) align with her role and history without over-explanation. Professor Hale serves as effective secondary pressure, his skepticism and trust sharpening Lila’s isolation and resolve. The only slight flaw: the final whisper (“Then I’ll dam it”) edges toward declarative neatness rather than embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tricksters’ note and the humming transmitter crystallize ongoing stakes with conceptual cost—the war isn’t won, just paused. The causal lens holds tightly: each beat (anomalies → calibration → transmission → truce → threat) links via “because/therefore.” Cost is legible in Lila’s exhaustion, community tension, and the singed chart’s ominous return. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no disorientation penalty applies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The university radio station functions as micro-setting: vintage equipment, oscilloscopes, and the transmitter directly enable and constrain Lila’s tactics. Sensory detail is selective (humming transmitter, bitter coffee, green flicker) and filtered through Lila’s professional urgency. The charts evolve from diagnostic tool to charged artifact taped on the wall, reweighted by closure. Only minor deduction: campus unrest is heard but not spatially choreographed beyond open windows.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving truth amid cosmic chaos—is signaled early and tightens when funding is threatened. Lila’s interference narrows options: she risks retaliation to restore harmony. The deepening occurs when subsonic frequencies succeed but provoke a new warning, raising the conceptual price of vigilance. Agency drives escalation; coincidence never resolves. Cost is felt in lingering division and the haunting voice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: power as mutable current, knowledge as fragile signal, resistance as harmonic counterpoint. The starlight wind chime and shifting constellations offer non-literal answers to control vs. chaos. Ambiguity lingers—the tricksters may return—but stance is clear: readiness over fear. Avoids moralizing; resonance stems from Lila’s actions, not exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable, intimate third limited to Lila, with perceptual specificity (“static between stars,” “hand rearranging the stars”). Voice modulates under stress—shorter sentences during transmission, lyrical flow in resolution. Dialogue is sparse but distinct: Hale’s gravelly pragmatism contrasts Lila’s terse resolve. No head-hopping; psychic distance remains controlled throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and varied, with strong verbs (“converged,” “knelt,” “crackled”) and rhythmic control. Sentences advance multiple layers—character, plot, atmosphere—without padding. Minor overwriting in “wind chimes made of starlight” slightly strains metaphor, but doesn’t obscure clarity. No loops or scaffold; closure image (“transmitter hummed… awaiting its next command”) propels thematic resonance cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cosmic horror and radio realism feels fresh yet inevitable. The “celestial signal interpreter” trope is grounded in tactile detail (oscilloscopes, thermos coffee), transforming abstraction into human-scale struggle. Power plays are dramatized through frequency manipulation, not just stated. Risk-taking (subsonic counter-signals, nonviolent resistance) heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure reconfigures the cosmos as contested chessboard.</comment>
