<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her zen potter identity manifests in tactile observation and quiet resolve. Her motivation (understanding entropy resistance) intensifies organically into a vision-driven revelation. The backstory of her younger self planting sunflowers as “a prayer” retroactively deepens her present arc without over-explaining. However, the emotional shift from observer to inheritor of memory lacks micro-choices under pressure; she receives insight rather than earns it through struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the oasis isn’t resisting change but choosing which timeline to nurture—a reframing that reweights every prior image with cost (the loss of other timelines). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via phototropic motifs until the thrumming climax fractures perception. Cost is legible in the final image—Mara carries warmth but leaves behind all other possible pasts. Orientation is crisp by line 30; causality remains intact despite nonlinear vision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The beekeeping oasis functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its anomalous soil enables sunflowers, which trigger the lantern’s reaction and thus the vision. Sensory detail is purposeful—ash-taste, barbed wire whisper, chipped glass—and filtered through Mara’s potter-perception (“time bent like clay”). The wasteland’s heat contrasts with the oasis’s stubborn life, charging the final departure. Every environmental detail feeds the central question of temporal resilience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding why kindness persists—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes she herself planted the hope-anchor decades prior. The tightening occurs at the sunflowers: their unnatural survival forces a confrontation with personal history, narrowing options to acceptance or denial. Cost is felt in the renunciation of other timelines (fortress, erasure), though the escalation leans slightly on revelation over active choice. Agency emerges in her decision to carry the lesson eastward.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through phototropism as metaphor for moral orientation: light-seeking becomes kindness-seeking. The final image—lantern glowing beside spinning clay—offers a non-literal answer: shaping time requires tending inner light. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete particulars (sunflowers, glass, hives). Ambiguity lingers (can one truly choose timelines?), but the resonance feels earned through sensory accumulation rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Mara notices texture, fracture, and light like a potter (“mind like still water,” “time bent like clay”). Syntax modulates with pressure—longer sentences in meditation, fragmented urgency during vision. POV remains tightly controlled; no head-hopping. Voice stays consistent even in lyric passages, with diction rooted in craft (“calloused hands,” “skeletal hives”) rather than academic abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “horizon bled orange,” “air tasted of ash,” “thrums resonated in her bones.” Figurative language is patterned (phototropism, light/shadow) without muddle. Minor redundancy in “fractured timelines” exposition slightly dulls momentum, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors wheel-spinning—steady, circular, forward-moving—charging closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes through specificity: a potter’s tactile wisdom replaces warrior-savior clichés; phototropism reimagined as ethical magnetism. The fractured timelines concept avoids sci-fi jargon, grounding metaphysics in botanical and ceramic logic. Risk-taking (lyric structure, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels inevitable in hindsight—sunflowers were always both literal and liturgical.</comment>
