<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lirael’s motivation—renewing her fading constellations—is rooted in consistent traits (tide dancer, cosmic scribe) and intensifies under pressure. Her internal conflict (fledge vs. anchor) manifests simultaneously in embodied gestures, not alternating summaries. The final act of writing the verse is earned by prior causality: the stolen dust, the dance, the ache. No diagnostic label-speak; pain is welcomed as proof of existence, not explained.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lirael endures elective exile, foreclosing rebellion but affirming her dual nature, with visible cost (verse fades by dawn, ban remains). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density increases through sensory layering, cadence shifts at climax, and the garden’s retreat reweights the stake. Cost is legible in “her heart full of obsidian grace”—a resonant, constrained stance. Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The twilight garden isn’t backdrop—it pressures choice (moss pulses like heartbeat, stars swirl during fledge) and supplies resources (luminescent mist, obsidian air). Moonstone dust and moss directly enable the ritual. Final image (“garden began to fade”) charges closure: setting’s withdrawal mirrors the nostalgia ban’s persistence. Body-as-setting (collarbone, forearm) constrains the penning act; tactile navigation throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—renewing cosmic connection despite the nostalgia ban—is signaled early and tightens when Lirael chooses penning over safety. Escalation is driven by her agency: stealing dust, dancing, writing. Cost is unmistakable: burning pain, trembling garden, fading verse. Under Accumulative lens, pressure deepens via sensory density and cadence shift at climax (“stylus gliding… each stroke burned”).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme—yearning as necessity, not rebellion—emerges through particulars: fading constellations, stolen dust, elective exile. Final image offers non-literal answer: endurance in the in-between reweights “Before” as private ritual, not public defiance. No moralizing; resonance arises from moonstone dissolving into skin. Ambiguity lingers (ban intact, verse temporary) without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Lirael notices gaps between breaths, silence between notes—lyric compression taught early and paid off in fledge mechanics. Rhythmic control under pressure: short clauses during writing (“Each stroke burned”), fluid syntax in dance. Stable third-person limited; no head-hopping. Voice modulates with intensity yet remains consistent—elevated diction (“obsidian grace”) fits her cosmic lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density: “moss that pulsed like a second heartbeat” conveys setting, character, and theme. Minor overwriting in peak beats—“celestial cloak,” “cosmos itself held its breath”—edges toward purple but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Closure image (“heart full of obsidian grace”) is clear, though “obsidian grace” slightly abstract. One paraphrase near climax (“shedding of the self to make room for the infinite” / “liberation”) costs 0.3.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: “tide dancer” reimagined as cosmic scribe in inland garden; nostalgia ban as societal plague. Tropes transformed—moonstone as key, fledge as shedding not flight—through specific, grounded choices. Elective exile reframed as active stance, not escape. Risk-taking (lyric structure, abstract stakes) heightens meaning without gimmickry; closure feels inevitable yet surprising.</comment>
