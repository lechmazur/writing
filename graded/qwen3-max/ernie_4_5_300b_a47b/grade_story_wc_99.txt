<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation—to find “the color of what my father never said”—is emotionally specific and drives every choice, culminating in a raw, embodied apology that alters the ghost’s form. Yorick’s quiet authority emerges through micro-choices (stitching, guiding) rather than exposition. Both characters avoid diagnostic self-awareness; their flaws (Lira’s blame, Yorick’s isolation) shape actions without safety-hedging. The final renunciation of silence carries visible cost: years lost, now irrevocably acknowledged.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira’s apology transforms spectral sorrow into peace, with the ship vanishing as tangible cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the lace’s growing density and the compass’s hum reweight remembrance as tidal force. Anchors (who, where, when) are clear by line 30; the severance backstory is concretely cued by the compass and salt-stained note. The final image—calm sea reflecting rain-washed sky—makes emotional cost undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The bonsai pot, lace spools, and compass function as micro-settings that constrain choices: Yorick stitches because thread is present; Lira rows because the compass points. Rain-damp earth, wet kelp, and cerulean bruise charge atmosphere while filtering through Yorick’s tactile perception. The islet isn’t backdrop—it supplies tools (thread, boat) and weather that enable the ritual. Final image uses the sea’s calm to reconfigure prior tension, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering unsaid words—is signaled early and tightens when the compass needle locks post-lace-stitching, narrowing options to one course. Agency lies in Lira’s choice to apologize, not in passive discovery. Cost is felt: her admission of blame fractures years of resentment. Escalation is driven by protagonist action (stitching → rowing → speaking), though the ghost’s appearance leans slightly on coincidence, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through lace-as-language and tides-as-memory, avoiding moralizing. The final image—sea calm after emotional release—offers a non-literal answer: silence can be undone, but only through vulnerability. Subtext thrives in gesture (clutching compass, trembling sapling) and charged objects. No false equivalence: the father’s abandonment is wrong, yet forgiveness is possible without erasing loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited through Yorick, with perceptual bias toward texture (calloused thumb, lace glow) and rhythm. Voice modulates under pressure: sentences shorten during stitching (“A knot here, a loop there”), then expand at climax. Dialogue distinguishes Lira’s frayed urgency from Yorick’s glacial cadence. No head-hopping; even the ghost’s speech aligns with Yorick’s focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “damp tang of post-rain earth,” “translucent as sea foam” avoid cliché through specificity. Syntax varies purposefully—long descriptive lines yield to staccato beats during stitching. One minor overwriting slip: “bruise of cerulean” slightly strains metaphor, but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bonsai, lace, and compass fuse into an original ritual where craft becomes cartography of grief. Tropes (ghost ships, unsaid farewells) are transformed by tactile specificity: forgiveness is a chain-link stitch, memories have tides. The synthesis feels inevitable—Yorick’s artistry enables Lira’s catharsis—and risks lyric abstraction without losing causality. Vision is singular: healing as collaborative making, not passive revelation.</comment>
