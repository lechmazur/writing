<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eleanor’s interiority is vividly rendered through tactile perception and idiosyncratic worldview, with micro-choices (e.g., tracing the scarf, selecting books) revealing a hierarchy of values. Her “sanely eccentric” trait manifests in embodied action rather than label-speak, though her transformation lacks visible cost beyond emotional uplift—undercutting full Earned Stasis. The young patron functions as foil but exerts minimal pressure; their exchange serves theme more than character crucible. Final renunciation isn’t tested, softening the climax’s stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the library’s vitality reawakens not through physical change but Eleanor’s shifted perception, crystallized in the final whisper from the scarf. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds via sensory density (candlelight, rustling pages, shimmering air) culminating in the mirror corridor and floating manuscripts. Cost is legible in Eleanor’s solitude and yearning (“restlessness,” “dormant stories”), paid through vulnerability to the unseen. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library functions as micro-setting that actively shapes tactics—the Edison bulbs, leather spines, and shared shelves create a liminal space where math and verse coexist. The scarf, treated as environmental object, charges the final image when it “whispers, *Continue*.” Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (lavender-and-ink scent, silk texture), avoiding white-room syndrome. However, the setting doesn’t constrain choice—it enables transcendence without tangible tradeoff, missing the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reawakening dormant stories—is signaled early and deepens via Eleanor’s midnight ritual. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: she chooses to visualize hyperbolic curves, triggering the library’s transformation. Cost is conceptual (years of cataloging forgotten texts, heavy silence) but not viscerally felt; the resolution grants reward without sacrifice. Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification suffices, yet the absence of foreclosed paths softens pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: stories live not in archives but in perceptual acts that embrace the impossible. The poem’s lines (“silence between notes,” “curves of your mind”) offer non-literal closure, reweighting prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture—the scarf’s reappearance, patrons’ hushed reverence—and avoids pseudo-profundity. However, the epiphany leans slightly toward assertion (“state of being accessible only through the lens of the impossible”), costing half a point.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose carries a distinct perceptual signature—Eleanor notices ink-smudged spines, frayed silk, hyperbolic diagrams—filtered through archivist sensibility. Rhythmic control modulates with pressure: short sentences during the mirror corridor (“The candles flickered. Books began to shift…”) contrast lyrical passages. No head-hopping; single POV remains stable. Dialogue is sparse but natural, though the patron’s skepticism resolves too readily, slightly flattening voice distinction at peak moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft shows high information density (“analog memories… fragile, tangible echoes”) and varied syntax, though occasional overwriting appears (“corridor of mirrors, each reflecting a different version of the library”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; figurative language remains coherent (scarf as memory-object, geometry as key). Final paragraph’s propulsion falters slightly with summary (“energy she’d unleashed”), but closure image (“whisper, *Continue*”) redeems momentum. Minor register drift in “resonant reconfiguration”-adjacent phrasing costs 0.3.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hyperbolic geometry and poetic mysticism feels inevitable in hindsight, grounded in specific details (hand-drawn diagrams, origami-time metaphor). Avoids template tropes by tethering “ghosts” to tactile objects and mathematical rigor. Bold risk in merging STEM and lyricism pays off through consistent world logic. Only slight proximity to Borgesian libraries noted, but transformed via analog-memory ethos and feminine lineage (the unnamed poet).</comment>
