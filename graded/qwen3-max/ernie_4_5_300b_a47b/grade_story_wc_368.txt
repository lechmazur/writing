<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lin’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her post-transplant sensory hunger feels visceral, not diagnostic. Her motivation to understand story-magnetism arises credibly from bodily change, and her final commitment emerges from observed human connection, not epiphany. However, the “two people” metaphor edges toward abstraction, slightly softening the otherwise concrete emotional arc. No secondary characters exert pressure; the travelers serve as chorus, not crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: light patterns, the wing’s iridescence, and Lin’s perception deepen until the wing vanishes, triggering a Conceptual Repricing—she now sees stories as light-refracted phenomena. Cost is legible in her irreversible shift from observer to illuminator. Orientation is immediate (floating tea house, dawn, Lin dyeing), and closure crystallizes as Charged Poise: she smiles, hands steady, embracing her new role with visible sacrifice of solitude.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house isn’t backdrop—it’s a stage that elevates Lin above mist, enabling her sun-tracking vantage. Obsidian stones, valley mist, and sunlight actively shape perception and action. The blue morpho wing functions as micro-setting: its physical properties (iridescence, fragility) constrain Lin’s choices and charge the climax. Final image ties setting to theme—mist burns away as clarity emerges.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deciphering why some magnetize stories—is signaled early and deepens when the wing’s flare reveals narrative communion among travelers. Lin’s agency drives escalation: she unscrews the vial, follows the light, witnesses the tale. Cost is felt in her irreversible transformation: the wing vanishes, but her new lens remains. Coincidence (sun alignment) complicates but doesn’t resolve; insight stems from her active witnessing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through iridescence as metaphor for fragile, refracted truth—not stated but embodied in the wing’s disappearance and Lin’s resolve. The final image reweights everything: stories aren’t possessed but shared in fleeting light. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether this gift is burden or grace. Central question (“why some lives become vessels”) finds non-literal answer in communal resonance, not individual destiny.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exceptional: Lin notices light’s emotional valence (“wet ink,” “labyrinth of cool blues”), filtered through her craft. Syntax modulates with tension—longer sentences for contemplation, fragments during the wing’s flare. No head-hopping; POV stays tightly bound to Lin’s senses. Voice remains consistent even in elevated moments (“quiet explosions,” “invisible threads”) because diction aligns with her artisan identity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line efficiency (“obsidian stones glowing faintly as dawn seeped,” “hues shifting from cobalt to violet to a blinding white”). Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors, no overwriting. Minor redundancy in “ravenously, to every whisper” (adverb + verb overlap), but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors thematic resolution: steady, luminous, conclusive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of transplant narrative with artisan mysticism—heart as story-receptor, dye master as narrative midwife. Tropes (magical object, floating sanctuary) are grounded in tactile detail (indigo pigment, glass vial, silver-streaked hair). Risk-taking in quiet climax pays off: revelation occurs through witnessed storytelling, not monologue. Vision feels singular—no template echoes—and fully commits to its lyrical logic without retreat.</comment>
