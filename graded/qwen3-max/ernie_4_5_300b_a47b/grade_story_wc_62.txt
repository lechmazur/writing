<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marlow’s interiority is vividly embodied—his chisel-calloused hands, unspoken grief, and tactile interactions with the ribbon convey emotional weight without therapy-speak. His motivation—to discover the shape of collective grief—is consistent and intensifies through micro-choices (returning nightly, reading his poem). However, the “spectral mentorship” voice borders on diagnostic exposition (“Your family’s grief is not a burden, but a bridge”), slightly undermining earned epiphany. Final renunciation of silence feels credible but leans on a single climactic act rather than layered causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: grief redefined as a “door,” not a “hole,” with visible cost in Marlow’s prior silence and isolation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via ancestral stories, butterfly migration, and ribbon imagery—culminating in a Charged Poise where options (to speak or stay silent) are crystallized. Orientation is immediate (“ancient greenhouse at dusk”), and the final image (faded but vibrant ribbon) legibly bears emotional cost. Minor deduction for the voice’s near-expository clarity, which risks feeling engineered rather than discovered.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as micro-setting and active repository—glass rattles, shadows dance, air “breathes”—constraining Marlow’s choices by channeling ancestral presence. Sensory detail (damp earth, brittle leaves, lantern flicker) is selective, POV-filtered, and evolves with the butterfly migration. The ribbon’s shifting colors charge the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate. Only slight overreliance on visual motifs (glass, light) prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming private grief into shared language—is signaled early and tightens through Marlow’s nightly returns and culminates in his poem. Agency is clear: he chooses to speak, altering his future carvings. Cost is felt (years of silence, fractured relationships), though escalation relies more on atmospheric accumulation than causal pressure. Butterfly migration adds texture but doesn’t force tactical shifts; still, the deepening of ancestral stories meaningfully reweights his understanding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: gravestones, ribbons, poems, butterflies. The ending offers a non-literal answer—grief as threshold—not moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence, scent, and shadow; the greenhouse becomes a metaphor only through lived experience. Avoids sentimentality by grounding transcendence in craft (carving, weaving). Slight deduction for the voice’s near-thematic echo (“bridge” line), which flirts with prompt-like articulation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has a distinct lyric rhythm—varied syntax, poetic but precise diction (“thundering calm,” “fiercely meditative”). POV remains tightly controlled in Marlow’s sensory and emotional frame; no head-hopping. Voice modulates under pressure (shorter sentences during butterfly swarm). Dialogue is minimal but purposeful; the spectral voice avoids naturalism but fits the accumulative lens. No register drift or filter-verb stacks; perceptual signature is strong (carver’s attention to texture, light, stone).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: most lines advance atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. Rhythm varies effectively, paragraph lengths breathe with emotional beats. Minor overwriting in “shadows that danced like restless spirits” and “living embers” edges toward mixed metaphor. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent sentences summarize ancestral losses rather than dramatize them (“his great-grandfather… his aunt…”), slightly dulling momentum. Closure image remains sharp despite this.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravestone carving, poetic inheritance, and ecological ritual (butterfly migration) transforms familiar grief tropes. Specificity abounds: twilight-dyed ribbon, chisel-calloused hands, medicinal herbs. The greenhouse-as-memory-vessel feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (spectral voice, lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Only slight derivativeness in “grief as door” metaphor prevents a higher score—it echoes common therapeutic reframing, though execution grounds it.</comment>
