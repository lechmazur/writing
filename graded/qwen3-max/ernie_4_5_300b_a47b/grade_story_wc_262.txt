<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation—to find “where unused love is stored”—is vividly embodied through tactile interaction with the film strip and crystal, revealing interior contradiction between longing and fear of inherited grief. Her spatial imagination isn’t just stated; it drives micro-choices (rewinding, pressing palm to celluloid) that escalate pressure. Emotional progression avoids tidy resolution—she doesn’t “fix” Elise’s pain but commits to witnessing it. The final whisper (“I’ll find you”) crystallizes her renunciation of passive inheritance in favor of active stewardship, with clear cost: she now carries generations of unresolved love.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara’s decision to carry the film strip reconfigures the Alhambra from tomb to archive, with emotional cost legible in her trembling hands and tears. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via sensory layering (rain, lilacs, flickering bulb), culminating in a cadence shift when the crystal flares. Orientation is immediate (“projection booth of the old Alhambra Theater”), and causality flows through psychometric contact, not coincidence. The snapped film-to-black beat mirrors Elise’s rupture, making past/present stakes inseparable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The projection booth functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: its dust, rattling window, and scarred table aren’t backdrop but active agents shaping Mara’s psychometry. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—Mara notices sprocket holes fraying, not generic “old reels”—and evolves causally (rain stops as insight dawns). The recurring crystal charges the final image, its condensation and pulse syncing with emotional breakthrough. Crucially, the booth’s decay mirrors unused love, making environment thematic without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering lost love’s residue—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes the letters were never sent, foreclosing reconciliation. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her second psychometric attempt forces confrontation with Elise’s choice to hide rather than communicate. Cost is felt in Mara’s throat tightening and crumpled fist—a physical manifestation of inherited grief. The war’s offstage role complicates but doesn’t resolve; Thomas’s absence remains a wound Mara inherits, not solves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: unused love isn’t abstract but stored in frayed celluloid and unsent letters. The final image—Mara descending as the building “approves”—offers non-literal answer: love persists not through completion but witness. Subtext thrives in silence (Elise’s tear-streaked face, snapped film) and avoids moralizing; the scent of lilacs reweights earlier decay into possibility. Complexity endures—Elise’s fear isn’t judged, merely held—making resonance linger without false closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled single-third, with perceptual signature rooted in spatial imagination (“lattice of memories”). Voice modulates under pressure: early sentences are measured (“fingers tracing grooves”), climaxing in fragmented urgency (“Images flashed… Mara gasped”). No head-hopping; even Elise/Thomas scenes are filtered through Mara’s psychometric vision. Diction stays within plausible lexicon—“hushed thunder,” “frayed sprocket holes”—avoiding academic drift. Rhythm varies purposefully, mimicking film reel unwinding then rewinding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density: “celluloid glinted under the flickering bulb” conveys light, texture, and instability in seven words. Sentence openings vary (“Mara’s gift…”, “She unwound…”, “For a moment…”), avoiding template cadence. One minor overwriting slip—“forgotten lyrics searching for a tune” leans slightly purple—but pays off tonally at closure. Zero paraphrase loops; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final paragraph’s “steps light” contrasts earlier “ache in her chest,” showing change without telling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms tropes (ghosts of cinema, psychic heirlooms) through specificity: love isn’t lost but misfiled in archival containers. The crystal gazer’s power is constrained by emotional residue, not magic—psychometry fails initially, requiring deeper focus. Risk-taking in lyric structure (past/present bleed via film) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight: only a spatially imaginative archivist could decode love stored as physical media. Fresh inflection lies in treating theater not as haunted house but as emotional library.</comment>
