<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s phobias are embodied with visceral specificity—“knives, crowds, deep water”—and her internal contradiction between terror and professional duty fuels every micro-choice. The child’s arrival doesn’t resolve her arc but catalyzes a reconfiguration rooted in prior causality: her decision to write on his cast emerges from accumulated vulnerability, not epiphany. Her voice avoids diagnostic label-speak; fear manifests as physical kinking, shaking quiet, breath held like borrowed air. The final renunciation—walking into the office trembling—is earned by this precise emotional architecture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist crystallizes her stance—“I would walk into the production office shaking”—with visible cost (erasure, betrayal) and reweighted purpose. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density (rusted stacks, whispering shell, smudged cast) until the cipher pattern triggers reconfiguration. Orientation is immediate (“the night I learned…”), and the rusted library under soundstage stars functions as both setting and psychological analog. Cost is legible in the burned file, the crossed-out name, the bruised resume held like a protest sign.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rusted library isn’t backdrop—it’s a crucible. Metal ribs, sealed books like organs, girder holes for wind: every detail mirrors institutional decay and bodily containment. The whispering seashell constrains choice by forcing attention to latent signals; its fake tide syncs breath, enabling the final collaboration. Stars painted on a soundstage ceiling charge the ending: transformation occurs not in reality but within the manufactured world that tried to erase her. Sensory hierarchy narrows appropriately under stress—wind, plastic, plaster—not tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—existential erasure vs. self-authorship—is signaled early (“not who I thought”) and tightens when the cast list replaces her name. The meaningful deepening occurs at the cipher table: decoding fear into agency (“FALL → LEARN”) shifts tactics from passive endurance to active defiance. Agency is clear—she chooses to write “TRUST HURTS, TRUST HEALS”—with conceptual cost: embracing visibility despite studio’s demand for invisibility. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; coincidence (child’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the real turn is her interpretation of his cast.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: vulnerability as power, not liability, refracted through stunt work, erased identity, and coded fear. The seashell’s fake tide and the boy’s cast aren’t symbols—they’re tools that reweight meaning. Final image (“writer of my own danger”) offers non-literal answer: authorship resides in trembling certainty, not manufactured invincibility. No moralizing; resonance accrues through particulars—smudged ink, burned files, rust—that avoid abstraction while inviting reflection on performance, labor, and self-naming.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV is flawlessly controlled: perception filtered through phobia (“body kinked around fear like a wire”), diction calibrated to stunt-double lexicon (“call sheets,” “stunt mark”), syntax tightening under stress. Voice modulates rhythm—long, lyrical sentences for decay; short, staccato phrases for panic (“knives, crowds, deep water”). Dialogue feels authentic: child’s plain “What happened to your name?” contrasts her steady-but-shaking reply, revealing status shift without exposition. No head-hopping; even the boy’s interiority is inferred through action (scribbling codes, grinning).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or conflict (“books sealed in clear plastic like organs in jars”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (decay, wiring, coding) and pays off—fear “kinked like a wire” echoes in the shell “half wired.” Zero paraphrase loops; syntactic variety mirrors emotional cadence. Final paragraph’s block letters (“TRUST HURTS…”) land with rhythmic clarity. Minor deduction: one slightly elevated phrase (“transformative betrayal”) risks register drift but is offset by concrete context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms tropes (stunt double, erased identity) through hyper-specificity: phobias named like colleagues, fear decrypted via child’s cast, rebellion staged in a rusted library under fake stars. The core premise—betrayal as catalyst for self-authorship—feels fresh because mechanics are grounded in occupational reality (burned files, call sheets) and emotional truth (trembling as power). Risk-taking (lyric density, Accumulative lens) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration (“writer of my own danger”) synthesizes theme, character, and setting inevitably.</comment>
