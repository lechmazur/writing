<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority is exquisitely concrete and contradictory—Keeper’s hope is “thistle-blown,” his retrocognition a “tethered beast.” His motivation (to recover his childhood plea) intensifies credibly, culminating in a renunciation of despair that forecloses resignation with palpable cost. The child’s voice release reconfigures his identity without sentimentality. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied through tactile ritual (carrying the prism “like a sleeping animal”).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the universe “confessed to caring at least once” not through spectacle but the survival of a fragile message. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story builds density via recurring images (prism, stars, hush) until the comet triggers a pattern-break that reweights meaning. Cost is legible: Keeper’s decades of exhaustion crystallize into one earned moment of resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glass humming pavilion functions as micro-setting: its vibrating panes channel “radio ghosts,” directly enabling Keeper’s retrocognition and shaping his nightly ritual. The fused-bone pedestal and ashen sky aren’t backdrop—they constrain tactics (climbing corroded steps) and charge the final image (starlight caught by shards). Sensory hierarchy reflects crisis: focus narrows to prism, comet, child’s voice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (“prove coincidences have meaning”) tightens when the comet appears—protagonist agency drives escalation as he “redrew his charts,” fitting new data into old destinies. Cost is unmistakable: “oil nearly gone,” “knees mutinying.” The shard’s release of his plea validates his endurance, making coincidence meaningful through earned reconfiguration, not luck.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the “shard of hush” swallowing “unsent pleas” reframes silence as preservation, not absence. The ending offers non-literal resolution—the universe’s “care” is proven by message survival, not divine intervention. Avoids moralizing; complexity lingers in the tension between cosmic indifference and fragile human meaning-making.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Keeper notices “thistle-blown hope snagging on rusted railings,” hears glass “singing under the comet’s pale roar.” Rhythmic control modulates with pressure—longer sentences for reflection, fragmented urgency during the comet’s arrival. No head-hopping; single POV remains immersive even in retrocognitive flashes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “dusk bleed through cracks,” “sky mosaicked with satellites.” Minor overwriting in “war-bright flares” slightly muddles imagery, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence (“broken prisms and stray comets could conspire…”) perfectly modulates rhythm to deliver closure without artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes through specificity: the “shard of hush” as emotional amber, retrocognition as burden. Risk-taking (lyric structure, conceptual stakes) heightens meaning without gimmickry. The synthesis of comet, prism, and child’s voice feels inevitable yet fresh—no derivative templates.</comment>
