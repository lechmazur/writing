<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrator’s interiority is vividly embodied—trauma manifests through tactile memory (“fingers brushing shoulders”), not therapy-speak. Their motivation to archive gestures emerges from crisis actor experience, grounding their present renunciation in credible history. The final choice—to walk stories into the floor—is earned by prior micro-choices (logging exchanges, tracing sentences) and carries visible cost: silence where truth should be spoken. Flaws like passivity are consistent and thematically resonant, not safety-hedged.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the gallery becomes a vessel of luminous absence charged by the narrator’s walking archive, reweighting the premise that ordinary voices matter even without a throne. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—density builds via whispered exchanges, phantom chess games, and footstep inscriptions—culminating in a Charged Poise where the dome itself remembers. Cost is legible in the final image: “routes of words only my feet could have written” implies irreplaceable labor and erasure. Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The whispering gallery functions as both setting and micro-setting: its acoustics pressure choices (whispers become confessions), its dome absorbs meaning, and its floor becomes an archive medium. The chessboard, footsteps, and draft all interact with spatial logic coherently. Sensory detail is purposeful—sound dominates, fitting the acoustic theme—and evolves causally (e.g., the glass case appears mid-story and alters visitor behavior). The final image charges the dome as a living repository, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving fragile human connection during political void—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator chooses silence over correcting the boy’s parents, then deepens with the decision to “unbind” the archive into the floor. Agency is expressed through attention and endurance, not action, fitting the Situational lens. Cost is felt in lost truth and looming closure, though escalation lacks a second concrete turn—still sufficient for this length. Coincidence never resolves; pressure remains coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: how people reach for each other when institutions fail. Subtext lives in gestures—knocks translating to consent, coughs as swallowed confessions—not exposition. The ending offers a non-literal answer to the central question (what does a pawn become?): it becomes a walker, a scribe of absence, reweighting expendability as quiet resistance. No moralizing; resonance arises from particulars like the pawnless chessboard and luminous echoes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is singular and controlled: syntax modulates with emotional intensity (longer sentences for reflection, fragments for tension), diction stays within the narrator’s plausible lexicon (“Acoustic Integrity Liaison” as dry irony), and perceptual bias filters everything through sound and stone. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained (only knows what’s heard or felt). Elision is pattern-taught (whispers stripped of faces) and paid off in closure. Rhythmic control under pressure is exceptional—e.g., the three-beat knock scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is consistent (“luminous absence,” “nomadic penumbra”) and never muddled. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary naturally. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “field medic of silences” beat, but clarity at closure remains intact. Read-aloud rhythm is masterful—cadence mirrors the dome’s echoes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise transforms familiar tropes (interregnum, whispering gallery) through specific synthesis: crisis actor + acoustic archivist + pawnless chess creates a fresh meditation on voice and expendability. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over plot) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic trauma; the boy reciting the narrator’s disaster is unforgettable. Vision feels authentic, not prompt-driven—the final image would collapse without this exact constellation of elements.</comment>
