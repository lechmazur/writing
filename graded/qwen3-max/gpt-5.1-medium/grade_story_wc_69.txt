<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maro’s interiority is richly embodied—his “traveled stillness,” wartime guilt, and ache of resignation manifest in gesture, not exposition. Dari and Ilan arrive with legible histories that pressure their choices without caricature. The choir’s micro-choices (waiting to sing, cracking on certain words) reveal hierarchies of fear and hope. Their final chord isn’t forgiveness but a credible, costly first step earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tentative chord between Dari and Ilan crystallizes altered stakes without resolving hatred. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story deepens through cadence shifts (silence → dissonance → fragile harmony) and patterned returns to the zither’s rosette. Cost is legible in Maro’s folded regrets and the students’ withheld voices. Orientation anchors firmly by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The velvet library isn’t backdrop—it’s a crucible. Heavy curtains enable subtraction of noise; bowed hymnal shelves imply accumulated border-crossing songs; autumn frost mirrors emotional thaw. The zither functions as micro-setting: its rosette constrains choice (students must gather around it) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective (wine curtains, rain-ticked windows) and filtered through Maro’s weary attention.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether fractured voices can coexist—is signaled early and tightens weekly as chairs shrink and glances lengthen. The meaningful deepening occurs when Dari and Ilan stay late, transforming abstract “vanishing arts” into embodied risk. Agency drives escalation: Maro’s method forces students to choose silence or vulnerable sound. Cost is felt in cracked voices and unshared silences, though the lens slightly softens concrete trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: interlocking hands on the zither, hymnals in ten languages, breath between pages. The ending offers no moral but a resonant image—a chord held between enemies—that reweights every prior silence. Subtext thrives in what’s unsung (slurs, beatings) and in Maro’s unspoken guilt. Complexity endures: harmony isn’t reconciliation, just “the patience that precedes it.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, filtered through Maro’s perceptual signature (“music lingered there like breath between pages”). Syntax modulates with pressure: long, velvet sentences early; fragmented urgency during the first note (“No one began at once; the silence held”). Diction stays within Maro’s lexicon—no register drift. The prose itself enacts “traveled stillness,” its rhythm embodying the theme.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “slurs in the marketplaces,” “ache worn thin and expectantly resigned.” Figurative language is purposeful (frost-quiet library, voices as barricades) without muddle. Minor overwriting in “stillness sewn into its seams” slightly strains metaphor coherence. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms choir-as-healing trope through specificity: zither rosette, factory-sung lullabies, hymnals at borders. The “vanishing arts” frame feels fresh, grounded in post-skirmish social fractures. Risk-taking in lyric structure pays off—accumulative texture heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final chord avoids sentimentality, offering charged ambiguity instead of tidy resolution.</comment>
