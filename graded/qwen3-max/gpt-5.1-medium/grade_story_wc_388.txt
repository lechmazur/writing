<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theo’s motivation—excavating truth from lies—is dramatized through embodied choices: reassembling shredded letters, digging in irradiated soil, and ultimately withholding the diamond. His internal contradiction (debunker who now guards a secret) manifests physically and ethically, culminating in an Earned Stasis with visible cost: he sacrifices his professional identity and possibly survival to deny the Committee leverage. The final renunciation feels inevitable yet costly, rooted in consistent traits and prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Theo holds the diamond, understanding its power, and chooses not to deliver it—foreclosing institutional control while accepting moral and physical risk. The Causal lens holds tightly: each beat (shed discovery → letter reconstruction → root excavation → decision) links by “therefore,” narrowing options until only one fraught choice remains. Cost is legible in the final image—the orchard’s survival vs. systemic weaponization—and the persistent constraint (radioactive environment, sealed records) shapes every tactic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard isn’t backdrop but active crucible: poisoned aquifers feed engineered resilience, dust storms limit visibility and time, and gnarled trees conceal the diamond’s burial site. Crucially, the setting constrains Theo’s final choice—the fruit sustains survivors, so destroying the diamond starves them—making environment inseparable from stakes. Sensory detail (glowing fruit dust, flaking bark, luminous veils) is filtered through Theo’s observational POV, never touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—control over engineered resilience—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Theo learns the diamond is a “crystalline stillpoint” that can propagate or withdraw survival. His agency drives escalation: reconstructing letters reveals the experiment; digging retrieves the key; choosing silence denies power. The cost is unmistakable: he becomes complicit in a new secrecy, trading debunker’s clarity for stewardship of a dangerous truth, with survivors’ lives hanging in the balance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: truth isn’t neutral but a lever of power, and some secrets must be kept to prevent weaponization. The flawed diamond—a cursed object transformed into a biotech template—reweights the premise: resilience is designed, not divine, and governance can weaponize biology. Final image offers non-literal answer: Theo’s silence protects the vulnerable not through revelation but restraint, rejecting both conspiracy fantasy and state control without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled single-third with a distinct perceptual signature: Theo notices bureaucratic residue (shredded invoices), geometric scars, microscopic ridges—details reflecting his debunker’s eye. Voice modulates under pressure: clinical during reconstruction, visceral during digging (“spade struck something that rang like glass but felt like ice”). No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon; rhythm accelerates during discovery, breathes in contemplation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful: “radioactive dust storms scratched the sky,” “fruit dust glowing faintly under his ultraviolet lamp,” “bark flaked like ash.” Sentences vary in length and structure, avoiding monotony. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “luminous veils” and “crushed, fractured halo”—elevated but not jarring. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; every line advances character, plot, or atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis: conspiracy debunker meets post-apocalyptic biotech parable, where the “cursed diamond” is a genetic key. Tropes are transformed—radiation-resilient orchard as engineered failsafe, not miracle; truth-seeking as ethical burden, not heroic triumph. Bold risk: ending with quiet refusal rather than action, trusting resonance over spectacle. Vision coheres singularly; removing any core element (diamond, letters, orchard) collapses logic.</comment>
