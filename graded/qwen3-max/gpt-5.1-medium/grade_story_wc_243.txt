<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The archivist’s interiority is richly embodied—walnut ink on fingers, locket warmth, bruising paper—and her micro-choices (pressing the photo, waiting for the nib to quiver) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on memory-as-weight. Her motivation intertwines grief and duty without sentimentality, and Mara’s spectral return tests but does not override her agency. The final act—writing until the paper feels “heavy enough”—is an Earned Stasis that forecloses closure yet affirms purpose, with visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions (preserving joy while haunted by loss) pulse through every gesture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the ledger’s ghost-ink reweights memory from clarity to weight, with undeniable cost (Mara’s absence, the city’s forgetting). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via sensory layering (barnacle crowns, phosphor footprints) until the sea “curls like a page,” revealing annotated jetties. Orientation anchors instantly (“twilight on the blooming jetty”), and the locket photo’s steeping triggers the climax causally within the established logic. Cost is legible in the final line: “paper finally felt heavy enough” implies ongoing labor, not resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The “blooming jetty” functions as micro-setting: barnacles wear “crowns,” mussel shells unfold like tulips, and the rail is “damp”—all constraining the archivist’s actions (steadying ledger, pressing photo). Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: salt and walnut ink early, iron/lilac/static at climax. The locket’s cheap metal and stiff hinge charge the final image when its photo births luminous script. Environment doesn’t just mirror—it enables the covenant’s regeneration, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving the weight of small moments—is signaled early and tightens when the archivist chooses to steep the locket despite knowing “context would change.” This deepening forces a trade-off: confronting Mara’s ghost risks emotional collapse but regenerates the covenant. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency (aligning ink/tide/memory), not coincidence, and the cost—haunted euphoria replacing simple grief—is unmistakable in Mara’s “sharper than joy” expression. Closure crystallizes stakes: keep writing, even when it hurts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: paper bruises, footprints are commas, laughter blurs photos. The ending reweights memory—not as record but as weight that “weighs us into meaning”—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (Mara’s unmoving mouth, gulls circling emptiness) and charged objects (locket, ledger). Ambiguity lingers (What are the sea’s terms?), but the core question—how do we honor what’s lost?—is answered non-literally by the archivist’s pen crawling with silhouettes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is singular: walnut-ink archivist’s lexicon blends archival precision (“regenerated covenant”) with lyrical tactility (“paper that can bruise”). Syntax modulates under pressure—shorter clauses during Mara’s emergence (“She looked exactly...”) contrast with flowing descriptions earlier. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices barnacle crowns, not festival crowds. No head-hopping; POV modesty holds (she infers Mara’s intent from waves, not omniscience). Elision (cuttlefish ink backstory) is taught early and paid off in thematic contrast.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “streamers dripping like tired snakes,” “footprints... dark comma linking heartbeats.” Figurative language serves causality—phosphor footprints lead to Mara; no mixed metaphors. Sentence openings vary (“It was twilight...”, “My fingers smelled...”, “Ten years ago...”), and paragraph cuts heighten rhythm (e.g., post-festival detachment before locket reveal). Minor overwriting in “iron and lilac and something like static” slightly muddles sensory hierarchy, but closure remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms archival tropes via specificity: walnut ink, bruising paper, proximate causes. The “regenerated covenant” isn’t mystical—it’s procedural, tied to tides and ink chemistry. Risk-taking (lyric structure, ghost dialogue via waves) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight: only this archivist, with this locket, on this jetty, could summon Mara. No derivative echoes; voice, concept, and setting cohere as a singular artistic stance.</comment>
