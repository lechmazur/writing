<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s stoic sensitivity and grief are embodied through tactile, precise actions—kneeling, gloved fingers tracing fractures, tucking notes like tucking someone to sleep—not diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (writing secret ledgers, using her grandfather’s inkwell) reveal a hierarchy of values that privilege memory over municipal utility. The final renunciation—accepting invisibility as witness—is earned by layered backstory and present ritual. Flawlessly avoids therapy-speak; emotion lives in cement grout and salt light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: absence “properly mapped, can burn” reweights engineering data into elegy, with cost legible in the drowned pavilion’s swallowed lights and Mara’s solitary return. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first image to last ripple—each note deepens the archive, each tide rise narrows her window. No causality breaks; orientation anchors instantly (“After the drawbridge rises...”). Final image crystallizes stakes without spectacle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion functions as micro-setting: its slick steps, fractured columns, and waist-deep balustrades directly constrain Mara’s movements and repair choices. The antique inkwell (brass corners “rubbed to a crescent shine”) charges the final image as both tool and heirloom. Sensory detail—“tang of old iron gall mingling with brine,” “stars cracked and scattered”—is filtered through professional and personal urgency. Environment actively shapes every beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resisting oceanic forgetting through hidden testimony—is signaled early and tightens as tide rises, forcing faster repairs and shallower ink. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to write, to place notes, to endure solitude. Cost is unmistakable: her labor vanishes into concrete, her name erased, yet she persists. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of loss (boy on seawall, grandfather’s death) reweights each repair.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through particulars: broken mosaics = missing voices, foundation cracks = interlaced absences. Final image—harbor holding “hidden sentences like lungs full of air”—offers non-literal answer: memory breathes in structural bones. Resists moralizing; complexity thrives in tension between civic duty (“certify concrete”) and private archaeology. Epiphanies arise from barnacles on marble, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is immaculate: surveyor’s precision (“measures, photographs, notes”) fused with poetic sensitivity (“drowned lantern,” “hushed blaze”). Syntax modulates with pressure—longer cadences for reflection, clipped phrases during tide-rise urgency. Zero head-hopping; POV modesty maintained (no omniscience). Voice remains consistent even in lyric height: “absence, properly mapped, can burn” feels earned, not imposed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “cement grout flows... swallowing the note so gently it feels like tucking someone into sleep” does triple duty (action, emotion, theme). Figurative language is coherent—light, water, breath motifs recur without strain. Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor deduction only because one or two high-pressure beats lean slightly purple (“oceanic smoothness”), but never obscures clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms “surveyor” trope into radical witness; the inkwell-as-archive is fresh and inevitable. Emotional specificity (grandfather’s pneumonia coinciding with dikes) avoids generic elegy. Bold risk: making bureaucratic labor sacred. Synthesis of engineering rigor and lyrical resistance feels singular. No derivative echoes; authenticity of vision permeates every line.</comment>
