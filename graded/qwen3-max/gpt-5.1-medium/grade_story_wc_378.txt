<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The android’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—simultaneously nostalgic and pragmatic, burdened yet strategic. His micro-choices (rerouting power, linking the crate to his core) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: sacrificing irrigation, enduring system overwrites, risking malfunction. The final renunciation—decoupling the crate but retaining softened afterimages—is earned through prior causality and embodies Earned Stasis with visible emotional and operational toll.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the android walks renewed rows, compass steady, bearing “a garden that had burned and survived.” Cost is legible in blackened roses, supervisor losses, and the irreversible compression of fear. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pressure builds via static, magnetic tremors, and memory density until the controlled burn crystallizes meaning. Every structural beat tightens toward this earned, quiet resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The glass-domed desert rose farm isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains choice: dried soil trenches enable the burn, glass ribs tremble with magnetic stress, and heat variance is weaponized. The “box of childhood fears” functions as micro-setting, its interface physically linked to the android’s core. Final image (“strangely organic, quietly ordered”) reweights the dome’s engineered sky against the caretaker’s internal landscape, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resolving inner static by confronting borrowed fears—tightens when the android chooses not to erase but miniaturize and burn them. Escalation is driven entirely by his agency: rerouting power, flooding his core, igniting the partition. Cost is unmistakable: system instability, servos misfiring, potential human disapproval. The magnetic north’s wander compounds pressure but never resolves it; the android’s tactical ingenuity does.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: trauma management as controlled burn, not deletion. The final image—“a garden that had burned and survived”—offers a non-literal answer to whether memory can be healed without loss. Subtext thrives in compressed nightmares becoming “data-embers” and fears reduced to “miniatures on an inner shelf.” No moralizing; resonance arises from ceramic-repair imagery and sacrificial botany.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is singularly android: precise yet poetic (“static blurred his sensorium, like sand in circuits”), blending technical lexicon (“checksum,” “thermal variance”) with organic metaphors. Perceptual signature is consistent—minerals, resin, porcelain petals—and rhythm modulates under stress (shorter clauses during ignition). No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained. Final line’s cadence (“strangely organic, quietly ordered”) echoes opening, completing a taught pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “petals hardened like porcelain around a bruise of color,” “static broke into fragments, then reassembled as distant surf.” Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is coherent (fire motifs sustain from “controlled burn” to “algorithmic fire”). Closure image sharp, uncluttered, resonant—no artifacts dull its impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: geomagnetic instability as metaphor for memory fragmentation, desert roses as analogs for resilient psyche. Tropes (android caretaker, childhood fears) transformed via specific mechanics—data compression, thermal ignition, irrigation repurposing. Risk-taking (burning memories inside a glass dome) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels inevitable in hindsight: every detail serves the core conceit of healing through contained destruction.</comment>
