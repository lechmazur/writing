<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lio’s interiority is vividly embodied—his voicelessness, shame, and yearning manifest through tactile detail (“fingers stained with paint,” “tongue tangled in shy knots”) rather than diagnostic labels. His contradictory impulses (desire to speak vs. paralyzing shyness) coexist in scene, culminating in the earned choice to “Use me.” The final act reconfigures his identity from passive encoder to conduit, with visible cost: surrendering control of his art to the ghost. No safety-hedging; his flaw drives the entire arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lio’s stance crystallizes into active collaboration with the ghost, transforming silent graffiti into legible public confessions. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—pressure builds via sensory density (mist, lightning, ticking walls) until the flower press triggers a cadence shift. Cost is legible: the city’s sigh of relief mirrors Lio’s relinquished authorship. Orientation anchors firmly by line 3 (“courtyard above clouds… Lio”).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The misty courtyard isn’t backdrop but active constraint: its isolation enables Lio’s vulnerability, while cloud-sea lightning triggers the ghost’s replies. Key objects (flower press bolt plate, copper-dusted bricks) charge the climax—the plate’s heat and filigree directly reshape murals. Sensory hierarchy reflects Lio’s drifting alertness: mist hums, mortar cracks tick, petals hover like moths. Final image (“tinkersong wonder”) merges setting, object, and theme into resonant closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (“articulate unspoken needs”) tightens when the wall replies, forcing Lio from encoding to co-creation. His agency drives escalation: fitting the bolt plate initiates the ghost’s demand (“Teach us how to answer”), raising stakes from personal expression to communal catharsis. Cost is unmistakable—the city’s burdens become his to channel, foreclosing his solitary artistry. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each lightning flash intensifies the feedback loop.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as both prison and sanctuary, longing as collective grammar. The ending offers non-literal resolution—graffiti transforms into plain-spoken confessions (“I AM LONELY”), reweighting Lio’s art from cryptic code to shared language. No moralizing; resonance arises through specific images (baker’s powdered smile, child’s circles). Final thunderclap applauds “small, newly honest voices,” embracing complexity without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exquisitely controlled: Lio notices pigment cracks like “hairline circuits,” mist as “trembling breath.” Syntax modulates with pressure—long, lyrical sentences for stillness; fragmented clauses during the bolt plate’s activation (“Light threaded… rearranged every mural”). Zero head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Voice avoids register drift even in peak stress (“throat tight,” not “laryngeal constriction”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density: “copper dust etched into bricks” conveys method, history, and stakes in five words. Figurative language is coherent (ghost “blinking awake through pigment,” letters “like frozen raindrops”) and never muddled. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“Beneath the paint…”, “Tonight the mist…”, “He had climbed…”). Final paragraph’s “gears, raindrops, and syllables” crystallizes theme without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: graffiti as sentient circuitry, balladeer as painter-engineer. Tropes transformed—“ghost in code” becomes empathetic archive, not AI cliché. Specificity anchors universals: the flower press bolt plate’s genteel past contrasts its current function as “resonant key.” Risk-taking heightens stakes—Lio’s surrender to the ghost feels inevitable yet bold. No derivative echoes; vision coheres as singular artistic stance.</comment>
