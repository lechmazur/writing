<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lan’s interiority is richly embodied—ink-stained fingers, breath matching wax spirals—and his moral burden as oath-keeper shapes every micro-choice. Maro’s fractured speech and withheld surname deepen relational tension without over-explanation. The final refusal (“It is not for you”) crystallizes Lan’s hierarchy of duty over curiosity with palpable cost. No diagnostic labels; emotion lives in tactile detail and constrained action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lan recognizes the recording as an accidental prophecy and refuses to share it, reconfiguring knowledge into forbidden burden. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through sensory layering (gauze-labeled fruit, velvet disquiet) until the wax reveals institutional oaths that name future storms. Cost is legible in the orchard’s tightening, fruit hanging heavier—a conceptual repricing of archival duty. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The skyscraper orchard functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: trees archive oaths via gauze labels, the river stone becomes ritual surface, and dimming lamps signal supernatural attunement. Every detail serves pressure—gravel crunches during tense silence, foghorn’s absence marks narrative time. Final image of “deaths that had not yet ripened” gains weight from this charged environment. No white-room syndrome; space choreography remains precise throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—archiving dangerous emotional patterns—is signaled early and deepens when Lan realizes the prophecy’s scope. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: his immersion technique reveals institutional oaths, forcing renunciation. Cost is felt in the orchard’s physical response and Lan’s isolation, though the tightening could more explicitly foreclose a tactical option. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the impossibility of neutral archiving when emotional weather predicts futures. Final realization—that past scribes also tried and accidentally prophesied—reweights all prior acts of preservation as ethically fraught. No moralizing; resonance lives in the wax curl remembering its spiral and fruit labeled like verdicts. Ambiguity lingers: is prophecy inevitable or created by the act of recording?</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Lan notices ink, grooves, dead languages—the world filtered through scribal precision. Syntax modulates with pressure (short clauses during immersion, lyrical flow in garden description). No head-hopping; Maro’s dialogue carries idiosyncratic fracture (“traffic” as alien concept). Voice remains consistent even in reflective shard—the childhood memory feels earned, not expositional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “fingers stained with ink as dark as the soil,” “wax ribbon curled softly… remembering the spiral.” Figurative language is coherent (orchard as archive, sound as ghost) and avoids purple excess. One minor redundancy: “shuddering sigh trembled” slightly overlaps. Final paragraph’s cadence masterfully slows to crystallize revelation without scaffold or loop.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: oath-keeping as emotional meteorology atop a skyscraper, using obsolete tech to trap prophecy in wax. Tropes (archive, prophecy) are transformed by specificity—gauze-labeled pears, phonograph stylus as relic. Risk-taking (lyric structure, dead-language subtext) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular: no template plot; every detail serves the core paradox of preserving feeling to predict doom.</comment>
