<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motivation—to defeat emotional numbness through responsibility—is embodied in micro-choices (e.g., lowering his blade to preserve guilt) that reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority avoids diagnostic label-speak, rendering emotion as faint pressure and embodied absence rather than therapy jargon. Arin-2’s resentment sharpens the conflict without caricature, and both clones’ speech carries distinct idiom. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality: defending memories over attacking builds toward the climactic refusal to erase guilt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dojo rocks drift closer as Kesh’s verdict forms, crystallizing options without explicit resolution but making cost undeniable—numbness vs. monstrous vivification. The drive lens is Situational: coherent pressure (memory duels under arbiter law) forces stance crystallization, not coincidence. Orientation anchors are clear by line 3 (“floating rock dojo,” “I stood,” “after my mind shattered last year”). History’s rewriting serves closure—it frames the argument as a stubborn annotation against erasure, reinforcing the thematic cost of selfhood.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo functions as micro-setting: spatial choreography (stepping onto sound-floor, converging at the node) pressures choices, and the glass tendrils securing the brain jar enable the final confrontation. Sensory detail is selective—wind carrying “fragments of forgotten verdicts,” fluid fizzing like soda—and filtered through the narrator’s numb POV. However, the setting doesn’t *constrain* the final choice (the memory duel could occur anywhere), missing the 9+ gate for environmental constraint on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—custody of consciousness to combat numbness—is signaled early and tightens when Kesh introduces memory-striking blades, forcing trade-offs: each parry or strike alters what can be felt. Protagonist agency drives escalation; choosing to defend memories over attack deepens his emotional reawakening. Cost is unmistakable: preserving guilt means accepting monstrous potential in the jarred mind, while victory risks becoming unrecognizable. The single meaningful tightening (from abstract custody claim to embodied memory defense) suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: selfhood requires painful continuity, not origin. The brain labeled “duplicate” becomes the crucible where authenticity is tested through preserved guilt, not primacy. Final image—rocks drifting closer as verdict forms—offers non-literal answer: self is relational, forged in shared memory’s cost. Avoids moralizing; complexity lingers (is numbness preferable to monstrous vivification?), and the clone’s resentment refracts the theme without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with perceptual signature: noticing dust, paper, and verdict fragments before bodies, reflecting dissociation. Voice modulates under pressure—syntax shortens during duels (“Strike,” “Wait”) while maintaining lyrical texture elsewhere. Dialogue distinguishes characters: Arin-2’s sharp logic (“duplication is origin”) vs. protagonist’s vulnerable plea (“my days are data”). No head-hopping; elision (e.g., skipping procedure details) is taught early via fragmented setting and pays off in memory-duel immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density: “feelings returned only as faint shadows” conveys numbness economically. Rhythm varies—long descriptive sentences contrast with staccato duel commands—without syntactic monotony. Figurative language is purposeful (“voice equal parts warmth and frost”) and consistent; no mixed metaphors. Minor artifact: “fizzed like soda disturbed by an unseen hand” slightly strains physical logic, but doesn’t obscure closure. Zero paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise transforms cloning tropes through specific moral calculus: custody hinges not on origin but willingness to bear guilt. Floating dojo, memory-striking blades, and history-rewriting sky cohere into singular vision where legal ritual embodies psychological stakes. Risk-taking (abstract setting, conceptual conflict) heightens meaning without gimmickry—the brain jar’s label “duplicate” becomes ironic anchor. Every element feels inevitable in hindsight; removing any (e.g., orange robe, black/white blades) would fracture the thematic symmetry.</comment>
