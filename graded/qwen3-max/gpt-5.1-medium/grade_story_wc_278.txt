<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist’s grief, guilt, and reluctant duty are embodied with visceral specificity—tattoos as memory, translating cries as burden—and culminate in a micro-choice (playing the voicemail) that forecloses perpetual haunting at tangible emotional cost. Interior contradiction thrums throughout: drawn to silence the firmware yet terrified of hearing his brother again. The final act is earned by prior causality, not sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the narrator chooses to offer his “truest sound,” accepting irreversible vulnerability to break the loop of guilt. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of sensory echoes builds until the voicemail’s playback reweights everything. Cost is legible in the trembling hands, the meteors finally burning. Orientation is deliberately disorienting early but pays off thematically and structurally at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The laboratory functions as both setting and crucible—the amber, server rack, and mixing board constrain choices and charge the ending. Sensory details (dusted vinyl, rain in microphones) are filtered through the narrator’s profession and trauma, never decorative. The piece of amber evolves from curiosity to totem to sacrificial anchor, directly shaping the final act.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silencing guilt through recovered voice—is signaled early and tightens when the firmware mimics the brother’s cry via infantile static. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: fetching the box, threading cables, playing the tape. Cost is unmistakable: confronting the raw, living voice of his dead brother, an act that risks psychological collapse but ends the haunting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through precise particulars: grief as unerased data, memory as fragile medium. The ending reweights the premise—haunting isn’t silenced by deletion but by offering presence—without moralizing. The amber’s trapped insect mirrors both the brother’s voicemail and the narrator’s suspended grief, making the final release resonate conceptually and emotionally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is singular: lyric yet grounded, technical yet tender (“tape catching on a bent reel”). Perceptual signature is consistent—sound as physical texture, time as folding fabric. Syntax modulates under pressure (shorter clauses during cable-connection), and elision (no explanation of firmware mechanics) serves mystery without confusion. No head-hopping; interiority remains tightly focalized.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is coherent (meteors “hush” then “burn”; firmware “feeds on old frequencies”). No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Minor deduction for slight overuse of metaphor in one high-pressure beat (“hands shaking as if meteors drag my bones”), but clarity at closure remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital haunting, analog nostalgia, and sibling grief feels inevitable in hindsight. Core elements—constellation tattoos, baby-cry translation, amber—are irreplaceable and causally active. Risk-taking (lyric structure, speculative tech) heightens stakes without gimmickry. No derivative tropes; every detail serves emotional truth and narrative logic.</comment>
