<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marek’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—his grief, duty, and moral precision coexist without resolution. The woman’s micro-choices (hesitation, frozen tears) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Both characters avoid diagnostic self-awareness; emotions are embodied (“cheeks windburned,” “crystalline drops that froze”). Final renunciation—truth woven carefully, not softened—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the woman’s tear-frozen realization crystallizes options—confession, unsealing records, redirecting inheritance—with undeniable conceptual and emotional cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: dream cameos braid into revelation, escalating via density and pattern break (recognition of surname). Cost is legible in the final image: candles flare then sink, glacier creaks—truth offered, burden accepted, no neat absolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The glacier shrine functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its fragility mirrors truth’s delicacy; candlelight multiplies reflections like fractured memory. The melted snow globe on the altar charges the final image—glitter arrested in cloudy water echoing stalled justice. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (Marek notices wax rivers, borrowed starlight), never decorative. Environment directly enables the ritual of listening and shapes how truth is delivered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—exposing buried corporate crime—is signaled early and deepens when the woman’s lineage is revealed. Escalation is driven by Marek’s agency: he opens dream-windows, interprets patterns, names complicity. Cost is unmistakable: the woman’s flinch, frozen tears, and implied lifelong reckoning. One meaningful tightening suffices—her family sealed doors; now she must open them—even if symbolic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: truth as raft for drowned voices, justice as salvage, not vengeance. No moralizing; insight arises from the snow globe’s dissolution and the woman’s silent cry. Final image reweights the premise—“borrowed starlight” flickers but persists, suggesting truth’s fragility yet endurance. Subtext operates in silence, gesture, and object; the central question (“Why me?”) is answered through action, not thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Marek notices ice like breath on glass, dreams as thin places, glitter like wet ash. Voice modulates with pressure—syntax tightens during revelation (“Your family helped seal those doors”). No head-hopping; single POV maintained with controlled psychic distance. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven, carrying subtext (“not to punish the dead, but to salvage something pure”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is consistent (candlelight as “uncertain stars,” dreams as “windows”) and never muddled. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; rhythm varies naturally. Final paragraph’s cadence—glacier creak, candles flare, starlight returns—resolves with lyrical precision without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise transforms ghost-whispering trope through specific mechanics (dream cameos), setting (glacial shrine), and moral calculus (truth as raft, not weapon). Emotional specificity avoids generic grief; Marek’s method ties oceanic loss to glacial silence. Risk-taking (non-seance mediumship, corporate villainy embedded in dream logic) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular—haunting, restrained, socially resonant.</comment>
