<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The registrar’s internal conflict—between duty and curiosity, silence and connection—is rendered with embodied specificity: her “notebook scarred with ink and doubt,” her “thin, brittle self” shaped by years of secrecy. Her final approach to the hooded figure feels earned, not sentimental, as it emerges from mirrored isolation and a shared language of mistrust. The micro-choice to pocket the tickets and later offer the lens reveals a hierarchy of values shifting under pressure. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in graphite smudges, trembling light, and unspoken intention.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the registrar steps from observer to participant, cracking mutual mistrust “like thin ice,” with cost felt in her exposed vulnerability (“heart pounding so loudly”). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—pressure builds through pattern (anonymous deliveries, doodled maps) until density breaks into action. Orientation is clear by line 30; causality flows via character agency (her projector trick, archive search). The final image reweights silence from refuge to bridge, with conceptual cost: she abandons archival neutrality for human risk.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The “crystal whispering forecourt after rain” isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint and mirror: droplets “listen,” crystals “sigh,” streetlight bends into “slow breathing halos,” all reflecting the registrar’s hyper-attuned solitude. The projector lens functions as micro-setting, enabling discovery and later becoming a “passport” of trust. Final image ties environment to transformation: silver mist translates music as crowds’ minds “unfurl,” yet the fringe where she stands becomes charged ground for human contact. Every sensory detail serves pressure or perception, never stalls momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to preserve sterile archival order or risk connection through contraband memories—tightens decisively when she chooses to investigate rather than destroy. Her agency drives escalation: unlocking the projector, cross-referencing footage, attending the concert. Cost is unmistakable: abandoning her shadow-self (“pressed flat” by secrecy) for exposure. Under the Accumulative lens, each doodle deepens stakes until the final choice crystallizes pressure into action, with coincidence (the hooded figure’s return) complicating but not resolving—the resolution stems from her courage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme—trust as fragile, nonverbal exchange in a post-linguistic world—emerges through concrete particulars: graphite storms on tickets, communal “radiant silence,” sensor beams versus paper. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: honesty isn’t spoken but enacted through shared objects and proximity, thawing mistrust without words. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers (who is the stranger?), yet the cost of isolation versus connection is undeniable. Recurring images (crystals, tickets, lens) reweight meaning: what was contraband becomes covenant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is exquisitely controlled: lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature fixated on light refraction, silence, and texture (“damp concert tickets… curled like fallen petals”). Syntax modulates with pressure—long, braided sentences early give way to taut fragments at climax (“heart pounding so loudly”). No head-hopping; single POV remains immersive even during reflection, which is anchored in present stimuli (tickets → memory of her own muteness). Diction stays within the registrar’s plausible lexicon—no register drift—making elevated phrases (“braided with the lamps”) feel earned, not ornamental.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“beading condensation as though it had been sweating fear”). Figurative language is coherent and purposeful—no mixed metaphors; vehicles align (ink as living, silence as fabric). Minor deduction for slight over-density in opening paragraph (“humming with spent thunder” / “bending streetlight into slow breathing halos” risks stacking), but clarity never falters. Final lines achieve perfect cadence: “shared paper and shared silence” echoes opening motifs while crystallizing closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in its fusion of speculative worldbuilding (post-linguistic society, crystal archives) with intimate emotional stakes. The core concept—eavesdropping on a concert via doodled maps—is fresh, specific, and fully integrated. Avoids tropes by grounding high-concept elements in tactile reality (sweating packages, heavy glass lens). Risk-taking (minimal dialogue, accumulative structure) heightens thematic resonance without gimmickry. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight: every image, object, and silence serves the central question of how trust forms when words fail.</comment>
