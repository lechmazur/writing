<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her fever-memory shivers, splinter-gripping palms, and metallic premonition feel specific and sensorially grounded. Her contradictory impulses (to unearth vs. re-bury the truth) operate simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation (“the weight is mine to carry”) is earned through prior micro-choices: pacing, questioning, gripping the desk. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression avoids tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara’s admission crystallizes her stance with visible cost—the burden of knowledge she can no longer outsource. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, escalating via pattern intensification (recurring Feverwhisper image, oracle’s static-laced voice, storm motifs) that reweights the central stake. Cost is legible in the final image: “swallowed truth settled low in her chest.” Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mountain station functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: isolation forces reliance on the oracle, rime-crusted railings mirror fragility of memory, wind turbines power the oracle’s persistence. Sensory hierarchy reflects crisis (Mara notices metal taste, splinters, green auroral light). Feverwhisper illustration charges the final image—its extinction ties environmental loss to institutional erasure. Weather actively shapes action (storms steerable; snow like ash during fever).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—validating whether storms are steered—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the oracle confirms Mara’s buried hypothesis. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each recurrence of Feverwhisper or storm reference deepens the moral weight. Mara’s agency drives escalation (she insists they speak; asks for the truth); cost is felt in her bodily reactions and social alienation (“margins of other people’s graphs”). Final crystallization carries opportunity cost: she accepts lifelong burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: institutional gaslighting masked as “anomaly,” ecological erasure, and the ethics of witnessing. The Feverwhisper—once healing, now extinct—becomes a silent indictment of predictive systems that serve power. Final image (“dawn bled green over the peaks, thin and sorrowful”) offers non-literal answer: truth persists even when unacted upon, and sorrow is the price of clarity. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers (who steers? why?) without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices botanical precision, thermal shifts, and data smudges—marking her as scientist and daughter of herbal tradition. Syntax modulates under pressure (shorter clauses during fever recall; lyrical cadence at dawn). Oracle’s voice—“rough with static and old storm records”—contrasts Mara’s embodied prose without convergence. POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping. Elision (fever confession off-page) is taught early and paid off through emotional residue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “rime crusted the railings in fragile, furred geometry” does atmospheric, tactile, and thematic work. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“On the ridge…”, “Inside…”, “Outside…”). Figurative language is coherent (mechanical lung, bright ash, invisible satellites). Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors resignation—longer sentences taper into stark declaration (“the weight is mine to carry”) then visual closure. No register drift or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: climate anxiety refracted through intimate loss (extinct plant, betrayed mentors) and speculative tech (fault-tolerant oracle as ethical witness). Tropes transformed—“steered storms” feel newly sinister via bureaucratic erasure (“error, an unavoidable anomaly”). Bold risk: making data storage architecture emotionally resonant. Irreplaceable specificity: Feverwhisper’s stippled leaves, smudged ink, and reservoir backstory root universal themes in lived detail. Vision feels singular, not prompt-derived.</comment>
