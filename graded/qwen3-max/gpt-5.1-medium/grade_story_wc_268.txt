<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The titan’s regal unpretentiousness and internal contradiction—caretaker vs. sovereign—are embodied in micro-choices (e.g., grinding ink pellets, seeding marginalia) that reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost. His motivation stems from a deeply personal flaw: having written the genealogical lie himself, he must now correct it without direct intervention. The scholar’s arrival triggers no external action but an internal surrender—his truth now entrusted to another—which constitutes Earned Stasis with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the scholar’s realization reweights the entire premise—the legitimacy of rule, the power of texts—and crystallizes the titan’s indirect victory. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; patterned messages intensify until the final beat where meaning collapses “with the graceful collapse of a thought realizing it has stood on air.” Cost is legible in the titan’s isolation and the frozen world’s dependence on his silent labor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ancient temple library functions as micro-setting: its time-dilated shelves, drifting patrons, and hairline-ceiling rainwater directly enable the titan’s tactics and charge the final image. Every sensory detail (dust-heavy light, worm-eaten scrolls, iron gall ink) filters through his caretaker POV and constrains choice—e.g., only books “that still remembered being read” can carry his message. The setting’s temporal fragility mirrors the blurred constellations and illegitimate throne.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preventing enthronement of a pretender—is signaled early and escalates through the titan’s agency: each cryptic insertion narrows the pretender’s legitimacy while deepening the cost of inaction. The tightening occurs not through physical confrontation but textual erosion, culminating in the scholar’s arrival as the sole conduit for truth. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure grows via density of symbols, not violence, and the cost is the titan’s enduring invisibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme—authority as fragile inscription, truth as marginalia—emerges through the rune of drift, split crowns, and corrected indexes, never stated outright. The final image offers a non-literal answer: legitimacy unravels not by decree but by quiet doubt seeded in unread books. Subtext thrives in the tension between monumental architecture and diminutive agency, rejecting tidy moralism for resonant ambiguity: correction requires relinquishment, not control.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is exquisitely calibrated: lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature that notices “ribs of stone,” “mute moons” of ink, and stars as “unfinished thoughts.” Syntax modulates with pressure—long, arching sentences for contemplation; tighter phrasing during the scholar’s arrival. POV remains tightly focalized; even cosmic stakes are filtered through the titan’s tactile rituals. No head-hopping, no register drift, no exposition—only implication and image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme without redundancy. Figurative language is consistent (architectural/biological hybrids: “fossilized sky,” “crown split like a seed pod”) and never muddled. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and the final paragraph’s cadence (“graceful collapse of a thought realizing it has stood on air”) delivers closure with poetic inevitability. No loops, no scaffold, no overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality lies in recasting political usurpation as bibliomancy—truth disseminated through marginalia in a temporally fractured library. The diminutive titan subverts epic expectations; power resides not in thrones but in index corrections. Every trope (forgotten guardian, celestial pause) is grounded in specific, irreplaceable details: iron gall ink from broken oaths, rainwater from ceiling cracks. Risk-taking (accumulative structure, passive protagonist) heightens thematic stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
