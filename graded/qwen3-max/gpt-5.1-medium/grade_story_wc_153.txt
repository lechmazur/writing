<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lysa’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “fierce tenderness,” tactile relationship with the shard, and moral restraint (“not to decide for the living man”) reveal layered contradiction under pressure. Her micro-choices (touching the shard, stretching fingers toward the pane) align with her role as witness rather than solver. The drowned brother’s pride-driven silence and the client’s fear of forgiveness are rendered with psychological precision, avoiding diagnostic labels. Final renunciation (“carry not absolution, but a fragile map”) is earned through prior causality and carries visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image crystallizes the before/after of withheld truth (“I was afraid”) with undeniable emotional cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density increases via sensory layering (condensation letters, phosphorescent wounds), culminating in a cadence shift that rewinds time only to isolate one pivotal sentence. Orientation is immediate and functional; disorientation serves closure by mirroring the liminal space of unspoken apology. Cost is legible in the shard’s quieted pulse and the spirits’ softened song.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice—roots as ribs, algae-painted trunks, invisible windows—all shape Lysa’s ritual and perception. The shard (tool-as-setting) charges the final image through its salt-veined history and regret-sensing pulse. Sensory detail is selective and urgent: crabs’ clicks narrow perception during climax; moonlight-healing algae mirrors thematic repair. Environment directly enables the vision and reconfigures stakes without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—accessing the pre-decision moment—is signaled early and tightens through protagonist agency: Lysa’s invocation triggers the spirits’ song shift, which rewinds time to isolate the critical pane. Escalation is driven by her choice to touch the shard and whisper her request, narrowing options to one unfinished sentence. Cost is unmistakable: the brother’s death, the client’s frozen grief, and Lysa’s burden of witnessing without fixing. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens until the final reweighting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: unsent letters, condensation sentences, and the shard’s storm-tasted mouth converge on the cost of unspoken words. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—“I was afraid”—that reweights the entire premise without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence, smearing gestures, and the brother’s pride-clamped tongue. Ambiguity lingers (will the client burn or send?), but the emotional truth—fear beneath anger—is earned through concrete vision, not assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable, immersive third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Lysa notices “gusts of vowels,” “breathing green wounds,” and “swallowed consonants,” filtering all through her medium’s sensibility. Voice modulates under pressure—syntax tightens during the vision (“hands balled, an apology banging against his ribs”), then breathes in the return. No head-hopping; even the brother’s POV is channeled through Lysa’s evocation. Diction remains within her plausible lexicon—no register drift or artificial constructions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control: sentences vary in length and structure to match scene needs (e.g., staccato during rewind, lyrical in aftermath). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“lullaby turned inside out,” “apology waits unspoken”) and pays off in closure. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every image advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in the vision transition, but clarity at closure remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of mediumship, mangrove liminality, and linguistic regret—the shard as cathedral mouth tasting storms is a fresh, irreplaceable conceit. Tropes (drowned brother, unsent letters) are transformed through specific rituals (condensation windows, spirit song). Risk-taking (nonlinear time, lyric density) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core insight—that the crucial moment is *before* the choice—is non-obvious and feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
