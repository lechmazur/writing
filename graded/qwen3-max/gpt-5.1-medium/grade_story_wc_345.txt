<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kerran’s altruistic ghost is vividly particular—organizing in death as in life—with interior contradiction (drowning in hospital light vs. posthumous efficacy) and micro-choices (scraping chalk despite spectral limits). Mara’s “strangely trustworthy” line crystallizes relational stakes without head-hopping. Flaws feel lived-in, not diagnostic; the ghost’s competence is balanced by helplessness (can’t be seen). Final endurance forecloses personal redemption but enables communal survival—cost felt in shattered bell and brambled hope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the nebula lifts orchards but costs homes, heirlooms, and the bell itself—“sap and dust streaking their faces” makes loss visceral. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through chime→chalk→crisis→nebula, each intensifying communal trust. Cost is legible in the cracked bell and abandoned ladders. Orientation anchors immediately (“orchard planet,” “twin moons,” “I was one of those dead”).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The floating arches, watering bell, and violet nebula aren’t backdrop—they constrain every choice (groves swung on harnesses, routes marked between arches). The bell’s mineral ghosts and auroral etchings charge the final image when it shatters. Sensory hierarchy narrows under quake stress (wind threading arches → gas flaring → planetary groan). Setting evolves causally: arches hum → crack → collapse, never static.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—saving orchards through collective action—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Kerran writes “Move now” after the bell cracks. Protagonist agency drives escalation: chalk messages → reexamined plans → grav-cranes deployed. Cost is unmistakable: elders abandon heirlooms, ladders spill like “discarded vertebrae.” The nebula complicates but doesn’t resolve—their labor earns respite.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: altruism’s legacy isn’t petitions but chalk-scraped trust; “brambled hope” rejects tidy salvation. The bell’s shift from weather-marker to communal oracle reweights all prior organizing. Final image—strangers holding each other amid shards—answers the central question: connection persists when systems fail. No moralizing; resonance lives in sap-streaked faces and solar-paint veins.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Kerran’s perceptual signature is precise (“mineral ghosts” in glass, “gauze separates living from organizing dead”) and consistent. Syntax modulates with pressure: lyrical cadence early (“trees bowed with fruit and lanterns”), fragmented urgency at climax (“Move now”). First-person ghost POV stays bounded—no omniscience, only what chalk and chiming reveal. Voice never slips into exposition or diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “luminous bruise,” “solar paint, tiny glowing veins over stone.” Zero loops or scaffold; every image pulls weight (butterfly garden’s absence haunts the bell). Figurative coherence: arches as reefs, ladders as vertebrae, nebula as harbor—all obey the world’s physics. Final line’s “brambled hope” crystallizes tone without abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms ghost tropes: the dead don’t haunt but organize via chalk and chiming. Floating arches + altruistic bureaucracy + nebula-as-respite synthesize into a fresh cosmology where collective care bends physics. Risk-taking (ghost POV, lyric escalation) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Every detail feels irreplaceable—swap “watering bell” for “church bell” and the orchard’s ethos collapses.</comment>
