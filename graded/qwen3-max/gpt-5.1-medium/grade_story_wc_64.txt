<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The gardener’s interiority is vividly embodied—his blithe demeanor masks a profound refusal to abandon the dead, revealed through tactile actions (raking, climbing, pressing palms) rather than exposition. His contradictory impulses—whistling cheer while haunted by unfinished intentions—are active throughout. The final renunciation (choosing to stay) is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost: he trades peace for stewardship of unresolved grief. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion arises from frayed tapestry threads, not therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the protagonist accepts his role as keeper of loose strands, foreclosing personal peace with visible cost (“I could not bear to leave the unfinished intentions”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via recurring motifs (chess clock, tapestry, sovereign case) until the silo hums and images rise. Cost is legible in the final image: “the night itself had finally exhaled,” implying burden shared but not lifted. Orientation is swift and functional disorientation (velveteen gloom, murmurs) pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt silo functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—it’s the only place where tapestry fragments reunite—and charges the final image (humming walls, starlit hatch). Sensory detail is selective and pressure-driven: cracked glass, frayed edges, cold wind. The sovereign case, rake, and soil-for-hands man all tie environment to theme. Crucially, the silo’s transformation from grain store to observatory reweights its meaning and the protagonist’s purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deciphering unfinished intentions to ease the dead—is signaled early and tightens when the tapestry strip ticks “with its own impatient heartbeat.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: he climbs, matches edges, presses palm. The deepening reveals his own identity as the soil-handed man, raising emotional cost. Closure crystallizes stance: he endures as gardener, trading grave for shed. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his choices under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory persists not through flowers but through resolving unfinished human business. The tapestry’s border—connecting graves to loom—embodies this without moralizing. Final image offers non-literal answer: velveteen gloom softens because he accepts his role, not because grief vanishes. Subtext thrives in silence (whistling off-key, unreadable symbols) and avoids binaries; some threads remain loose, honoring complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is singularly lyrical yet precise—“velveteen gloom that seeped from headstone to headstone like ink through watered silk”—with rhythmic control that breathes during calm and tightens during ascent. Perceptual signature is consistent: a gardener notices lichen patterns, frayed edges, soil textures. No head-hopping; first-person POV modestly infers only what hands and eyes confirm. Elision (how he died) is purposeful and paid off by thematic resonance, not confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is coherent (tapestry as memory loom, chess clock as life meter) and avoids muddle. Minor overwriting in one beat (“cobalt candle… stars that watched with unwinking, indifferent eyes”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift harm closure. Final paragraph’s cadence—“softer, as if the night itself had finally exhaled”—resolves with perfect propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cemetery as archive of unresolved human gestures, tended by a ghost who forgot he’s dead. Tropes (chess, tapestry, silo) are transformed through specific, grounded choices—the soil-handed man moves pawns like seedlings. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure, blurred life/death boundary) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise feels inevitable in hindsight and irreplaceable; swapping any key element would collapse the delicate metaphysical ecosystem.</comment>
