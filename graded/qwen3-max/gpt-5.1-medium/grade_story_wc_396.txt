<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ira’s internal conflict—between peacekeeper training and empathic intuition—is rendered through embodied choices (e.g., silence as listening, using mirrors as cognitive tools). The anomaly’s raw desire for self-determination feels earned, not allegorical. Their dialogue crackles with subtext, and the shadow-asymmetry visually externalizes inner dissonance without therapy-speak. Final micro-choice—to reconstitute rather than impose—flows directly from his flaw: mapping empathy onto action even when it defies protocol.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the treaty is reframed from ownership to recognition, with the orchard as deciding voice. Cost is legible in Ira’s risk of moral forfeiture and the Keepers’ potential loss of legitimacy. The inferred lens is Causal—each beat follows “because/therefore” logic (e.g., because the anomaly shows futures, Ira adapts method). Spatial and temporal anchors are clear by line 30; no orientation penalty applies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint: ice floes limit access, fog obscures, lanterns guide perception. The vintage store’s mirrors aren’t decorative; they’re tactical tools that enable the accord’s reconstitution. Final image—fragment held to glass—charges closure by transforming setting into deliberative instrument. Sensory hierarchy (grinding ice, stormwater smell) reflects Ira’s urgency without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent war by integrating the anomaly—is signaled early and tightens when Ira sees himself causing both tragedies. His agency drives escalation: he doesn’t just observe futures but tests visions in mirrors, narrowing options via the anomaly’s reactions. Cost is unmistakable: either path sacrifices sanctuary or supervision, and his final choice risks total rejection by Keepers. Pressure coheres under Causal lens without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: compassion as refusal of instrumentalization. No moralizing—the crystal fragment’s “restless light” becomes a metaphor for contested futures only through use. Final image reweights premise: treaties aren’t about control but witness. Ambiguity lingers (will Keepers agree?), but the conceptual cost—moral legitimacy vs. conquest—is undeniable and non-literal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Ira’s “calmly intuitive” perception (“silence tasted like fear wrapped in stubbornness”). Voice modulates under pressure: shorter sentences during mirror visions, lyrical cadence in descriptive passages. Dialogue distinguishes characters—the anomaly’s clipped irony vs. Ira’s measured phrasing—and indirection carries subtext (“You called for mediation… though we both know you do not believe in our laws”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “lanterns swinging like low moons,” “choices kneeling on his ribs.” Figurative language is purposeful, not decorative—each image advances atmosphere or character. Minor redundancy in “mapping fear onto vision” / “map empathy onto action,” but no scaffold loops. Final paragraph’s rhythm accelerates then crystallizes, matching the reconstitution act. One near-mixed metaphor (“choir” for ice, then “choir” implied in mirrors) slightly muddles, hence no 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise fuses geopolitical treaty-making with magical realism in a fresh synthesis: the “courageous anomaly” isn’t a rebel but a place asserting agency. Tropes (lighthouse, crystal ball) are transformed—mirrors become diplomatic tools, ice floes geopolitical fault lines. Risk-taking (trees/tides having legal standing) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular, not prompt-derived; every detail serves the core question: can compassion be institutionalized?</comment>
