<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her skepticism, bone-setting expertise, and moral calculus manifest in precise sensory detail (“limbs posed exactly right,” “forgave only people, and only if they learned from the smudges”). Her final choice to step through the doorway emerges directly from her established contradiction: mistrusting miracles yet compelled by empathy. The displaced boy’s “shrewdly innocent” eyes mirror Tomas’s ethos, forcing Mara to reconcile doubt with action. Every micro-choice—from rejecting the corpse to realigning alien bones—reveals a hierarchy of values with tangible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: doubt accrues as texture until it becomes a portal. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Mara’s fractured certainty widens into a doorway, and she chooses to cross, transforming doubt into action. The cost is legible in the crumbling substitute body and the physical toll of realigning the boy’s bones. The hedge maze’s seasonal shifts and the tooth’s warmth are not just motifs but causal constraints that shape every turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The secret garden functions as both setting and micro-setting: its shifting hedges, rusted tools, and starlight-humming instruments actively constrain choice and charge the ending. The tin box “breathing faintly” and the tooth “still wet with impossible warmth” fuse environment with emotional stakes. Spatial choreography is flawless—from bone-setter’s table to violet sky—and the dawn “snagging on the hedge” crystallizes the return. Every detail serves pressure, never stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to trust Tomas’s hidden truth—is signaled early and deepens when Mara finds the tooth. Escalation is driven by her agency: she follows the map, interprets the folios, steps through the doorway. The cost is unmistakable: she abandons village consensus, risks disbelief, and physically remakes a child’s body. Tomas’s plan to “turn mistakes into constellations” isn’t abstract—it demands Mara’s hands, her doubt, her forgiveness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through particulars: the counterfeit body, the changeling tooth, the hedge maze as mutable horizon. The final image—doubt made bearable through action—reweights the entire premise without moralizing. Tomas’s “nostalgic innovation” and Mara’s bone-setting become metaphors for repair across ontological rifts. The story refuses tidy resolution; instead, it offers a constellation of smudges, scars, and missteps navigated by those “still foolish enough to yearn.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Mara’s voice is singular: skeptical yet tender, precise yet poetic (“scars arranged like careful handwriting,” “experiments grew beside rumors”). Syntax modulates under pressure—longer, lyrical sentences in reflection; taut phrases during action (“Bone by bone I guided him”). POV remains tightly controlled; no head-hopping, no omniscience. Even elision (e.g., Tomas’s off-page attempt) serves the Accumulative lens, paying off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—every sentence multitasks. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“smudges,” “constellations,” “borrowed starlight”) and culminates in the tooth’s “impossible warmth” tugging at “the empty space where my certainty had fractured.” No loops, no scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. The final line—“doubt felt almost bearable”—resonates because it’s earned by concrete action, not abstraction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The fusion of faerie lore, bone-setting pragmatism, and epistemological doubt feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (changelings, secret gardens) are transformed by specificity: Tomas’s glass instruments, Mara’s professional gaze, the tooth as receipt. The risk—making doubt a literal portal—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Originality lies in the moral calculus: forgiveness extended not to people, but to the universe’s “clumsy paperwork.”</comment>
