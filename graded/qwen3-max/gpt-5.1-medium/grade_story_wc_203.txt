<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motivation—to discover what ceilings hide—is embodied through micro-choices (kneeling, analyzing dust, touching the barrel) that reveal a hierarchy of curiosity over caution. His ghost-seeing trait is not expositional but operational, shaping his perception and actions without melodrama. The boy ghost functions as secondary pressure, not a foil, and their interaction tightens stakes without diluting focus. Final choice to “engage” feels earned by prior behavior and carries the weight of irreversible exposure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ceiling breach reveals an inverted room, reconfiguring reality itself, with cost legible in the ghosts’ bracing and the mainspring’s tremor. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds via sensory density (humming wires, flickering light, pulsing bulge) until the final cadence shift (“the contract torn”). Orientation is immediate (“abandoned circus ticket office,” “elevator repair technician who sees ghosts”), and causality flows through observation → inference → action. Every image feeds the ending’s conceptual rupture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting functions as active constraint: the ticket office’s reflective windows, cracked plaster, and humming wires shape perception and action. The brass mainspring barrel—dusty yet polished—acts as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is precise (ghosts along walls, boy leaning over shoulder, bulge in ceiling), and the inverted room payoff hinges on earlier ceiling fixation. Environment doesn’t just mirror theme—it enforces it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering hidden truths—tightens when the fluorescent buzz dies, shifting from maintenance to revelation. Protagonist agency drives escalation: his decision to touch the barrel directly causes the ceiling breach. Cost is felt in the ghosts’ tension and the irreversible exposure to the inverted room. One meaningful deepening suffices, though a second tactical consequence (e.g., loss of escape route) would elevate further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the recurring idea that facades crack from within—applied to buildings, reality, and perception. The final image of the upside-down room reweights the premise: ceilings aren’t barriers but fragile treaties. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete particulars (dust patterns, trembling barrel). Subtext thrives in silence—the boy’s murmur, the ghosts’ stillness—and the cost is conceptual: once seen, the breach cannot be unseen.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinctively technical yet poetic (“read residue like a slow-motion film,” “humming faintly through old wiring like a distant, anxious beehive”). Perceptual signature is consistent: the narrator notices occupational details (cables, counterweights) and spectral anomalies with equal precision. Syntax modulates under pressure—shorter clauses during the ceiling pulse—and POV remains tightly controlled. No head-hopping; even the boy ghost’s dialogue filters through the protagonist’s haunted professionalism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“facades crack from the inside”) and pays off in the ceiling rupture. No paraphrase loops or scaffold—each image builds toward the breach. Minor deduction for one slightly ornate phrase (“entrails” for dying hum), but closure remains crystalline and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</question><comment>Premise transforms elevator repair and ghost-seeing into a metaphysical investigation of structural lies. The inverted room is a fresh, non-obvious twist that feels inevitable given the obsession with ceilings. Risk-taking (textural accumulation over causal plotting) heightens thematic stakes without sacrificing clarity. Voice, concept, and setting cohere into a singular vision—no hedging, no template echoes.</comment>
