<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Nari’s motivation—carrying a message to her vanished brother—is rooted in specific, embodied grief (the amber bead, the fraying of promises) and intensifies through micro-choices: trading wool for puzzle pieces, unwinding her life’s work. Her internal conflict—between hope and resignation—is rendered without diagnostic labels, shown via tactile actions (pressing bead to lips, feeding threads into cardboard gaps). The final renunciation—sacrificing her tapestry—is earned by ten years of latent sacrifice already woven into every thread. Flaws like stubborn hope feel human, not contrived.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Nari forecloses her weaving path with visible cost (bare loom, older orchard), crystallizing a Charged Poise where footsteps turn “as if hearing.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via recurring motifs (threads, silence, raveling) until the puzzle becomes a sideways loom. Cost is legible in the skeletal loom and exhaled breath; causality is maintained through consistent rules (threads bind only with sacrifice). Orientation anchors firmly by line 3: who (Nari), where (orchard in bamboo forest), when (autumn, ten winters post-vanishing).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The forgotten orchard functions as micro-setting: crooked apple trees among bamboo constrain solitude, which “makes the threads listen,” directly enabling Nari’s craft. The environment charges the final image—the bare loom amid frost-silvered apples mirrors her emptied self. Sensory detail is selective (moonlight threading bamboo, cardboard edges sparking in fingers) and filtered through Nari’s tactile obsession. Crucially, the setting supplies the puzzle’s spatial logic: bamboo swallows paths, just as blizzard swallowed Haru—mirroring without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reaching Haru across impossible distance—is signaled early and tightens when the puzzle demands equal sacrifice. Nari’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to unweave her tapestry, narrowing options irrevocably. Cost is unmistakable: “the loom stood bare and skeletal,” and the orchard “felt abruptly older.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each thread fed deepens the blizzard image until a lone figure appears, making the conceptual cost (youth, art, voice) viscerally felt in the final breath and turning footsteps.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme—communication across loss—emerges through concrete particulars: threads catching unborn echoes, puzzles knowing where corners belong. Subtext lives in silence, beads, and unwoven cloth; no moralizing. The ending reweights prior material non-literally: the puzzle isn’t solved but transformed into a conduit, suggesting messages transcend physical completion. Ambiguity lingers (do footsteps mean Haru hears, or is it hope?), yet cost is undeniable—her art is gone, replaced by fragile possibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled single-third, with a distinct perceptual signature: Nari notices textures (cardboard sparks, amber bubbles) and silences over sounds. Voice modulates under pressure—syntax shortens during puzzle assembly (“Hours slipped past; frost silvered…”), then expands at climax. No head-hopping; focalization stays anchored in her tactile, weaving-centric worldview. Diction (“raveling silence,” “brittle line of the horizon”) feels organic, never academic or ornamental.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “bamboo swallowed the paths, apples shriveled unpicked” conveys decay in 7 words. Figurative language is coherent—threads, puzzles, and silence all orbit the core metaphor of connection/fraying. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“She wove because…”, “Once, long ago…”, “That night…”). Final line (“distant footsteps turned, as if hearing”) resolves with charged ambiguity, echoing the walking stick’s “stubborn question” without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms tropes (vanished sibling, magical craft) through specificity: weaving as temporal messaging, puzzles as spatial looms. The bamboo-orchard graft failure mirrors Nari’s attempt to fuse memory and hope. Risk-taking—silent protagonist, no dialogue, abstract stakes—heightens emotional truth. Originality peaks in the puzzle’s function: not a map but a loom turned sideways, warping space via sacrificed art. Feels inevitable in hindsight; no derivative beats.</comment>
