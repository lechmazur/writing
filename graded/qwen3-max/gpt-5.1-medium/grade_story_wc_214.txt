<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The janitor’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—shy yet spiritually curious, invisible yet yearning to witness—and his micro-choices (lifting the glass, whispering a promise) arise from consistent traits. His emotional arc avoids diagnostic label-speak; instead, feelings are embodied (“chest ached,” “hurt felt spacious”). The final stance crystallizes through earned vulnerability, not epiphany, with visible cost in relinquished invisibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the janitor’s vow to “keep watching” reconfigures his role from cleaner to witness, foreclosing his prior path of invisibility with palpable emotional cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pressure builds via sensory density and pattern shifts (dust → projections → visions), culminating in a resonant stillness that reweights the entire premise. Orientation is clear by line 3; causality remains intact without retroactive patches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The shooting star station functions as micro-setting: its dust, consoles, and dome directly constrain action (mopping, monitoring) and charge the ending—the broom becomes a staff, the lantern glass a projector. Sensory detail (ozone, metallic tang, crushed-nebulae dust) is filtered through the janitor’s custodial POV, avoiding tourist cataloging. The recurring object (lantern glass) and tool (broom) both shape tactics and crystallize the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—being seen versus remaining invisible—is signaled early and deepens when the lantern reveals falling stars as human moments. The janitor’s agency drives escalation: lifting the glass, stepping closer, taking the broom as a staff. Cost is legible in his chest’s “spacious hurt” and the risk of standing exposed. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length, though a second reversal (from cleaning to witnessing) would push it higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the universe, like the overlooked worker, needs tending in its vulnerable pauses. The final image—stars charted by human feeling, not cold data—offers a non-literal answer to “why the sky bothers to move at all.” No moralizing; resonance arises from particulars (kite, window, ship). Subtext operates through silence, gesture, and the broom’s transformation into a staff of witness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable, intimate third-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the janitor notices dust, vents, and instrument hums, not celestial mechanics. Voice modulates under pressure—syntax tightens during revelation (“He saw not stars but moments”), then expands in stillness. Diction stays within his lexicon (“mops,” “buckets,” “pipes”) without academic drift. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests entirely on internal rhythm and selective attention, which remain impeccable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“meteors stitched white scars,” “dust that glimmered like crushed nebulae”), but occasional overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“molten silver hanging almost still, like thoughts before they learn their names”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, yet two adjacent sentences slightly restate the stillness concept. Sentence variety and paragraph rhythm support emotional cadence, though one mixed metaphor (“universe rearranged its bones and left the marrow bare”) borders on strained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cosmic janitor trope is transformed through grounded specificity: his empathy for flickering lights and weary vents makes the metaphysical feel tactile. The fusion of custodial labor with cosmic witness feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmicky. Risk-taking (lyric structure, conceptual stillness) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative echoes; the vision coheres as singular, anchored in emotional truth rather than surface novelty.</comment>
