<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—smoke-knot in the chest, feather as failed pen—and their micro-choices (dimming lights against protocol) reveal a hierarchy of values. Mira’s “softly ingenious economy” manifests in precise gestures and voice-blur from rebreather, avoiding stereotype. Their shared exhale and near-touch crystallize a relationship that evolves under pressure, culminating in collaborative redesign. The burnt feather’s emotional weight ties flaw to motivation without diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: belonging redefined as “the interval between breaths shared in noticing,” charged by the cost of the village fire. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story builds through sensory density and patterned light/dark until bioluminescent shrimp rewrite the dome’s script. Orientation anchors immediately (“ocean above the dome,” “landscape astrologer”), and causality flows through observation → hypothesis → action → shared rhythm. Final image pulses with earned resonance, not mechanical resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting functions as active crucible: the dome’s failing lights dictate human and marine movement, algae-furred statues evoke decayed memory, and pressure-thick rooms shape posture and speech. The burnt feather (micro-setting) constrains choice—it traces patterns on fogged glass that become lighting sequences. Bioluminescent shrimp transform external ruins into living constellations, directly charging the final image. Every detail filters through the astrologer’s sky-trained perception, avoiding museum-tour detachment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning “the rhythm of belonging”—tightens when the protagonist abandons chart-based diagnosis for embodied attention, narrowing options from repair to co-creation. Agency drives escalation: overriding protocol to dim lights reveals the true problem isn’t electrical but perceptual. Cost is legible in the feather’s ash-smell and the relinquished surface identity. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens—each flickering light deepens the thematic question without false resets.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the feather’s transformation—from relic of failure to drafting tool—and the dome’s shift from malfunctioning grid to breathing rhythm. Subtext thrives in silence: Mira’s mirrored nod, shared shoulder proximity, and unspoken grief for lost homes. The ending offers no moral but a resonant image: wild shrimp-script over faces as belonging becomes mutual attunement. Avoids sentimentality by rooting epiphany in concrete collaboration (“mapped where people gathered”) rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is singularly lyrical yet precise—“mountain shadows and river constellations,” “towers like reefs made from forgotten errands”—with syntax modulating from long, flowing sentences to terse realizations (“It is not failure”). POV remains tightly focalized; even Mira’s dialogue carries underwater distortion (“voice blurred slightly by the rebreather collar”). Perceptual signature is consistent: sky-reader notices light as harbor, constellations in shrimp. No head-hopping; prose rhythm mirrors the story’s tidal cadence without monotony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density: “algae-furred statues frozen in parade” conveys decay, stillness, and civic memory in seven words. Figurative language is coherent—light as harbor, city as reef—and never muddled. Sentence openings vary (“Floodlights combed…”, “I had charted…”, “She offered no handshake…”), and paragraph lengths breathe with scene pressure. One minor density risk: “shadowseam wonder” borders on neologism, but context earns it. No loops, scaffolds, or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms the “haunted facility” trope through the landscape astrologer’s unique epistemology—reading earth-folds as sky—and the underwater setting’s inversion of celestial navigation. Original synthesis: electrical faults diagnosed as attention architecture, repaired via bioluminescent mimicry. Emotional specificity (village wildfire, kestrel feather) grounds speculative elements. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; the “breathing rhythm” closure feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
