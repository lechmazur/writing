<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrator’s interiority is vividly specific—Ora’s humane design ethos, the “stone in my shoe” of not-knowing, the tactile memory of her bug reports—all ground motivation in character rather than plot convenience. Their obsessive tracing of 713 emerges credibly from grief and professional ethics, culminating in a final choice (closing the interface) that embodies Earned Stasis: they know where deleted files go but accept they cannot retrieve Ora, foreclosing action with palpable cost. The patch functions as both talisman and moral compass, linking past and present without sentimentality. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied through micro-choices like spoofing an audit or pinning the patch to their lanyard.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “deleted does not mean gone” shifts from corporate euphemism to ontological truth when the narrator discovers profiles persisting in Deep Cold, reweighting the entire archive’s premise with chilling social cost. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—the story builds through pattern recognition (713’s recurrence) until silence itself becomes data, yielding coordinates. Cost is legible in the final line: “knowing at last where deleted files go, and who chooses to stay” implies complicity and resignation, not rescue. Orientation is immediate (“I am the corporate memory keeper”), and every shard serves the central mystery without disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The social network archive functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains choice: chilled racks, memorial gardens, and Deep Cold aren’t backdrop but operational realities shaping access and ethics. Sensory detail is purposeful—the “humming cathedral,” “soft blue” interface, “brief pressure in a room”—filtered through the narrator’s professional gaze. The crashed spaceship patch evolves from souvenir to keycard substitute, charging the final image when pinned to the lanyard. Environment directly enables the climax: the archive’s “tendency to echo” allows the 713 pattern to surface, making the setting a co-conspirator in revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding Ora’s fate—is signaled early and tightens through the narrator’s escalating breaches (spoofing audits, querying silence). The meaningful deepening occurs when 713 leads not just to her but to a systemic purge of privacy/compliance staff, raising stakes from personal grief to institutional conspiracy. Agency drives escalation: each lie and query narrows options until the final renunciation (closing the interface) crystallizes stance with conceptual cost—truth without recourse. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with coincidence (713 appearing everywhere) complicating but never resolving the core conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the collision of digital immortality and corporate erasure: deletion as relocation, silence as data, archives as prisons. The final image—profiles continuing “stripped of ads and metrics”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: some vanishings are chosen refusals of commodification. Subtext thrives in gaps: Ora’s “crash was really an escape,” the system’s “stutter” as resistance. No moralizing; resonance accrues through particulars like checksum tails and birthday reminders, avoiding binaries while implicating the reader in complicity (“we tell regulators and ourselves”).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is a masterclass in perceptual signature: syntax mirrors archival logic (“Every scroll… backed up in chilled racks”), diction blends tech jargon (“checksum tails”) with poetic precision (“choir forced to sing commercial jingles”). POV modesty is impeccable—no knowledge beyond what the narrator could infer, with elision (Deep Cold’s mechanics) creating friction paid off through pattern recognition. Rhythmic control under pressure shines in the climax: short clauses (“I closed the interface”) after lyrical density embody Charged Poise. No head-hopping; the single perspective’s texture deepens without register drift or filter-verb stacks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density: “RESOLVED is not a verdict, it is a lie” compresses institutional critique into eight words. Figurative language is pattern-taught (the archive as cathedral/choir) and payoff-earned (silences as “doorways”). Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“My office sits…”, “People think…”, “Officially…”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Minor deduction for one slightly over-compressed clause (“Threaded between them were moments of silence tagged 7:01:03”), but no artifacts dull the closure image—final lines land with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes digital-age tropes (data ghosts, corporate cover-ups) through a uniquely humane lens: Ora’s bug reports as art, silence as interface design. The risk of treating absence as content pays off in the climax, transforming technical minutiae (checksums, timestamps) into emotional vectors. No derivative beats; even the “missing persons” frame is subverted—victims choose deletion as sanctuary. Bold structural choices (accumulative patterning, lyric closure) heighten stakes without gimmickry, and the spaceship patch metaphor feels inevitable yet fresh in hindsight.</comment>
