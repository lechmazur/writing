<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The explorer’s claustrophobia and "prudently adventurous" nature manifest as embodied contradictions—measuring risks while trembling, trusting a broken compass over instinct. His micro-choices (reciting measurements, selecting the central hall) reveal a hierarchy of values under spatial duress. The final descent is earned through consistent interior struggle, not epiphany, and carries visible cost: surrendering safety for meaning. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are tactile (“walls shivering nearer in imagination”).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the explorer descends into compressed midnight, accepting transformation as cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens via sensory density and patterned disorientation that reweights stakes without causal turns. Orientation anchors instantly (“claustrophobic explorer… canyon path… moonrise”), and spatial mutiny pays off at closure through architecture’s reconfiguration. Cost is legible in the final breath before descent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting functions as active antagonist: canyon walls “press like accusations,” corridors “disagree with intuition,” and flagstones “glimmer with dewless sheen.” The temple’s mutable geometry constrains every choice and culminates in the spiraling staircase cut from “compressed midnight”—a micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective (dust-and-thunder air, bone-threading vibration) and filtered through the explorer’s phobia. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite distortion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the key—tightens when spatial mutiny manifests in diverging halls, forcing a choice with mortal consequence (“air itself might tighten until his ribs protested”). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: aligning the compass fragment triggers architectural response, proving spatial rebellion is real. Cost is unmistakable—the explorer trades open sky for buried lung, enduring claustrophobia to fulfill legacy. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via sensory intensification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between measurement and mystery: maps become rumors, distances lie, yet the explorer trusts flawed tools over fear. The final descent offers a non-literal answer—truth requires surrendering control, not conquering space. Subtext thrives in objects (broken compass, brass tube) and silence; no moralizing. The “wistful rebellion” of stone against imposed silence mirrors the explorer’s own patient defiance, reweighting legacy as communion rather than conquest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is exquisitely calibrated to a claustrophobic surveyor: syntax tightens under stress (“breath shortened, walls shivering nearer”), then expands in awe (“walking inside someone's slow, reluctant sigh”). Perceptual signature is consistent—starlight as “silver lattice,” shadows as “deepening water.” No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained (he infers temple’s resentment but doesn’t claim certainty). Rhythmic control peaks in the silent chord that “bruises geometry,” where compression heightens pressure without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“dust and old thunder” conveys history and decay in four words). Figurative language is coherent—spatial mutiny as “wounded wings,” light as “disciplined column.” No loops or scaffold; metaphors accumulate meaning (compass fragment → spatial alignment → descent). Minor deduction for slight overuse of semicolons in mid-story, but closure beat (“accepting the key might change him first”) is flawlessly clear and resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Originality lies in fusing architectural horror with emotional archaeology: the temple isn’t haunted but *resentful*, its rebellion expressed through warped geometry. “Spatial mutiny” transcends metaphor—it’s a lived constraint that reshapes tactics. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over causality) heightens stakes by making disorientation visceral. The synthesis of grandmother’s lore, drafting tools, and organ resonance feels inevitable yet fresh, avoiding genre clichés through specificity (“extinct ink,” “compressed midnight” steps).</comment>
