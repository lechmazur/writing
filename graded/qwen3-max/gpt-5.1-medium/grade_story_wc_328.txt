<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The protagonist’s internal conflict—between scientific detachment and awe—is embodied in precise, contradictory impulses (e.g., the urge to catalog vs. surrender to wonder). Mara’s cryptic authority exerts steady pressure, and the researcher’s final realization (“Maybe work now was to turn bitterness into a cosmic joke”) is earned through visceral exposure to the mountain’s logic. Minor deduction for slight emotional summarization in the last line, though it serves Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the “harmony untamed” reframes loss not as erasure but transformation, with clear conceptual cost—the institute’s mission collapses, replaced by a mythic ecology. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, escalating via sensory density and confessional static until the final reconfiguration. Orientation is immediate (“first time I saw…”), and the flint arrowhead’s vibration signals early that classification fails here.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The underground garden functions as active micro-setting: inverted trees, pulsing soil, and bone bowls directly enable the metamorphosis revelation. Every sensory detail (chamomile fog, metallic air) filters through the researcher’s professional bias yet destabilizes it. The cordless phone—a tool—constrains the climax: only by touching it does the protagonist access the mountain’s archive, charging the final image with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding what takes people—tightens when the phone reveals confessions-as-seeds, forcing the researcher to abandon extraction for witness. Agency is shown through tactile choices (accepting the phone, resisting cataloging), and the cost is conceptual: the institute’s framework becomes obsolete. Escalation is driven by the protagonist’s willingness to listen, not coincidence, under an Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between institutional knowledge and mythic reciprocity, crystallized in the final line’s “cosmic joke”—a non-literal answer that reweights the entire premise. Subtext thrives in objects: the arrowhead shrugs off taxonomy; plants echo lost voices. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers (Is this salvation or assimilation?), yet the emotional aftereffect—grief composted into chorus—is concrete and haunting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is singularly textured: clinical lexicon (“cryptid researcher,” “taxonomy”) fractures under lyrical pressure (“fallen through a bruise in reality”). Perceptual signature is consistent—botanical precision meets poetic destabilization—and rhythm modulates with stress (static burst = short clauses; revelation = flowing cadence). No head-hopping; Mara’s dialogue carries distinct idiom (“You carry the mountain on your face”), deepening mystery without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “frostbitten hope, brittle and persistent”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“bruise” motif returns in leaf color) and payoff-earned. Minor overwriting in “gravitationally playful spirals”—slightly ornamental—but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops or scaffold; sentence variety supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise transforms missing-person tropes into ecological mythos with rigorous internal logic: confessions seed plants, the mountain “carries” grief. Risk-taking (cordless phone as mystical receiver) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Every element feels inevitable in hindsight—the arrowhead’s age, the phone’s red light—and specificity (cracked plastic, chamomile fog) grounds the uncanny. Bold, cohesive vision.</comment>
