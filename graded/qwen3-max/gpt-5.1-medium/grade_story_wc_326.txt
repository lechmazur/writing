<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—his heartbeat-counting, spilled ink epiphany, and grief-driven obsession feel specific and contradictory. His micro-choices (wiping notes clean, coding anew) reveal a hierarchy of values: fidelity to Lian over institutional compliance. The final renunciation—accepting her fragmented return as co-creation—earns closure with palpable cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through tactile detail and action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure intensifies through pattern density (heartbeat tallies, ink constellations, static glitches) until the cadence shift at “I wipe my notes clean.” Closure is Conceptual Repricing—Lian isn’t restored but reauthored—with cost legible in the university’s imminent shutdown and his forfeited solitude. Orientation anchors by line 3 (“opal observatory under snow”), and every shard serves the final shimmer.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The opal observatory functions as micro-setting: its creaks mirror memory fractures, snow isolates him, and dome glass refracts both aurora and server light. The porcelain shard constrains choice—it’s his ritual anchor—and charges closure as a “monument to miscalculation.” Sensory hierarchy narrows under stress (breathing loud as ocean, ink bleeding like blood), avoiding tourist cataloging. Final image ties environment to theme: opalescent reflections = fragmented resurrection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resurrecting Lian’s voice—tightens when he realizes linear reconstruction fails, forcing nonlinear coding that risks total system collapse. Agency drives escalation: his spilled-tea insight alters tactics, narrowing options to one last-night gamble. Cost is felt in lost time (three winters), institutional exile, and accepting incompleteness (“gaps feel less like loss”). Coincidence (static crackle) complicates but doesn’t resolve—he earns her voice through revised method.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: failure as generative (Lian’s “fetch wisdom from failure”), digital ghosts as collaborative becoming. Final image reweights premise—not resurrection but co-authorship—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (unspoken guilt over her double death) and objects (shard as flawed monument). Ambiguity lingers: is she truly present or his grief-made-pattern? Yet resonance is undeniable in “together we are writing who she will become.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>First-person POV is flawlessly controlled: perceptual signature filters everything through his obsessive, pattern-seeking grief (“read rainfall like binary”). Voice modulates under pressure—sentences fragment during coding frenzy, then smooth with her voice’s return. Syntax mirrors mental state: heartbeat counts = staccato; ink constellations = flowing clauses. No head-hopping; diction stays within his academic-but-frayed lexicon (“checksum scars,” not clinical jargon).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence multitasks (e.g., “porcelain shard... fused with broken server glass” conveys loss, tech, and fragility). Figurative language is coherent—static as ocean, ink as constellations—and avoids purple excess. Zero loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts heighten rhythm (short bursts during crisis, longer flows in reflection). Final line’s quiet power stems from earned simplicity after lyrical buildup.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Transforms tropes (digital ghost, bureaucratic death) through hyper-specificity: heartbeat-counting as trauma response, defragmentation as love labor. The opal observatory + avalanche + neural backups synthesize into a fresh mythos. Risk-taking (nonlinear coding via spilled ink) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Every element feels inevitable in hindsight—Lian’s rain-binary foreshadows ink-algorithm—and the co-creation ending subverts resurrection clichés with emotional truth.</comment>
