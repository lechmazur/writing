<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s "logically emotional" core drives every micro-choice, from vibrational matching to singing through the key—embodied, contradictory, and consistent. Her internal hierarchy (love for the sea over fear of violence) manifests in action, not exposition. The final renunciation of control for consonance feels earned by seventeen winters of calibration. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is bone-deep and tactile.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she emerges not just intact but transformed into a "weaver of waves," with the Heartstone now pulsing in time with her breath—a legible before/after. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through sensory and sonic layering until the climax reweights the stake via cadence shift. Cost is felt in exhaustion and the relinquishing of engineering-as-control. Orientation anchors are immediate and precise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina isn’t backdrop—it actively resists then guides her, its groans shaping tactics. The azure coat, frost, mercury basin, and bioluminescent moss all constrain or charge choices. Final image (brushing frost from her coat under stars) ties setting to transformation. Sensory hierarchy shifts under pressure: crisis narrows to vibration and breath, then expands into awe.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting the Heartstone from discordant sound—is signaled early and tightens when sonic harpoons strike. Escalation is driven by her agency: she adapts, sings, becomes the buffer. Cost is visible in exhaustion and the irreversible shift from engineer to guardian. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each sonic layer intensifies until transmutation occurs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme—violence answered by frequency, not force—emerges through action, not assertion. The Heartstone’s "sonic absolution" reframes power as resonance, not domination. Final image (scavengers kneeling in revelation, ice stilled) offers non-literal resolution that reweights every prior beat. No moralizing; complexity remains (malice dissolved, not punished).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-limited, filtered through her profession (“calibrating beacon harmonics”) and sensory bias. Voice modulates rhythmically: short, percussive phrases during attack; lyrical flow in awe. Distinct perceptual signature—she notices harmonic frequencies, ice stress patterns, thermal gradients. No head-hopping; prose-as-character evident in technical-poetic diction (“vibrational matching”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density: nearly every line advances character, stakes, or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught (sound as texture, ice as sentient) and pays off at closure. Minor overwriting in “bones ache with purity” slightly strains physical logic, but not enough to obscure causality. Sentence variety supports propulsion; no loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic physics, lighthouse lore, and ecological guardianship. Tropes (chosen one, sacred artifact) are grounded in specific professional detail and emotional contradiction. Risk-taking (nonviolent resolution via frequency) heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular—“logically emotional grace” as heroic mode is both original and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
