<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas’s motivation—decoding through “borrowed memory”—is consistent, embodied, and drives micro-choices (e.g., tucking the Edelweiss over his heart, returning to the dock nightly). His internal contradiction—detached observer yet emotionally receptive—fuels credible endurance without sentimentality. The final renunciation (not reporting findings) is earned by his worldview and carries conceptual cost: truth belongs to the sea, not institutions. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges via sensory residue (“crackled faintly with each breath”).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the Edelweiss reweights from morbid curiosity to a signature of shared sacrifice, revealing the stranger’s death as intentional witness-bearing. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds via sensory gaps until the fourth night’s shard-memory crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible in Silas’s silent stewardship and the unspoken bond between two ghosts. Orientation anchors firmly by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The opal dock, mist, and nautical twilight aren’t backdrop but active constraints: the dock’s slick planks and recurring twilight frame Silas’s ritual, while mist literalizes the “gaps” he observes. The Edelweiss functions as micro-setting—its texture, scent, and placement directly enable the climactic memory shard. Final image charges the setting: lantern beam “guiding no ships tonight—only ghosts,” fusing environment with theme. Sensory hierarchy reflects Silas’s profession and obsession.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decoding the stranger’s final gesture—is signaled early and deepens into understanding a pact of borrowed memory. Escalation occurs through Silas’s method: each twilight visit tightens focus until the fourth night yields a decisive intensification (mountain-pass memory). Agency is clear—his choice to withhold findings forecloses official resolution with conceptual cost. Coincidence (matching Elara’s photo) complicates but doesn’t resolve; insight arises from his accumulated observation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme—love and memory as softly persistent, transcending death—emerges through concrete particulars: the brittle flower, alpine scent, Swiss photograph. Subtext thrives in silence and gaps; no moralizing. The ending reweights the premise: gestures outlive givers, and some truths resist institutional capture. Final image (lantern guiding ghosts) offers resonant, non-literal answer to “what did the stranger intend?” without stating it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is exquisitely calibrated to Silas’s perceptual signature: lyrical but precise, favoring tactile and auditory detail (“crackled,” “hollows between waves”). Syntax modulates with pressure—longer, flowing sentences for reflection; shorter phrases for revelation (“He understood now”). No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained (he infers, never knows outright). Diction remains within his eccentric keeper lexicon—no register drift—even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“mist thickened like breath held too long”) and paid off (“mist curled around his ankles like a question”). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in the mountain-pass shard—could risk clarity, but context sustains legibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms familiar tropes (lighthouse keeper, mysterious corpse) through specific synthesis: “borrowed memory” as investigative method, Edelweiss as alpine-maritime cipher. Emotional truth grounds ingenuity—Silas’s quiet stewardship feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (accumulative structure, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision coheres fully: tone, setting, and concept fuse into singular artistic stance.</comment>
