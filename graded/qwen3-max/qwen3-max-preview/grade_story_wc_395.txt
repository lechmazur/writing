<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The memory keeper’s interiority is concrete, contradictory, and embodied—her obsession masked as duty, her lies layered with self-deception. Her micro-choices (slipping the janitor a burner phone, triggering the restore) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final renunciation—accepting she’s not just a keeper but an anchor—is earned through prior causality. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in scorched thread and server hum.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “deleted files don’t go—they linger”—a rule-set shift with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, escalating via pattern density (0707 recurrence) to a cadence shift at 07:07. Cost is legible in her daily lies, her isolation, and the irreversible stance crystallized in the final image. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The archive functions as micro-setting—server racks as mausoleums, frosted glass as barrier—and directly constrains choice (she accesses quarantined DMs, triggers resonance in the deepest vault). The Helios-7 patch, body, and corrupted thumbnails act as tactile extensions of setting. Sensory detail (hum, flicker, warmth of spinning drive) is selective, urgent, and POV-filtered. Final image charged by the patch stitched to sleeve—setting fused with character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering where deleted files (and people) go—is signaled early and tightens into a moral imperative. Protagonist agency drives escalation: mapping 0707, deceiving supervisor/janitor, flooding the system. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits professional integrity, personal safety, and emotional detachment. The deepening—from curiosity to communion—narrows options until only silent witness remains viable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: deletion as de-referencing, memory as rhythm, silence as scream. The final image—“they linger… wait… humming back”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext thrives in negative space: gaps between posts, ghost pixels, unsent goodbyes. No tidy resolution; ambiguity lingers with emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, rhythmic, and perceptually biased—the keeper notices metadata, server hums, flickers. Syntax modulates under pressure: short staccato phrases (“She lied… She lied…”) contrast lyrical passages about resonance. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained. Elision (e.g., skipping mission details) is purposeful and paid off in closure. Diction stays within plausible lexicon—no register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense, varied, and propulsive—every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or concept. Figurative language is controlled (“mausoleum of deleted posts,” “resonance chamber”) and never muddled. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Final line (“humming back”) recharges the opening motif with earned resonance. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms digital-age tropes (deleted data, corporate erasure) into haunting metaphysical inquiry. Synthesis of astronaut mythos, archival labor, and networked grief feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking (lyric structure, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Voice, subject, and style cohere as singular artistic stance—no template echoes. Irreplaceable specificity: 0707 as temporal coordinate, not random code.</comment>
