<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The technician’s motivation—rooted in quiet responsibility rather than trauma or spectacle—feels deeply individualized and consistent. His micro-choices (using the mainspring barrel, whispering “I see you,” tucking the evidence bag near his daughter’s photo) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible emotional cost. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are embodied through tactile observation and restrained action. The final renunciation—bearing witness without extraction or exploitation—is earned by every prior beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the technician’s act of witnessing releases the ghost not through exorcism but acknowledgment, crystallizing his role as keeper of neglected stories. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—dust patterns, light angles, and sensory residues build toward the ceiling-tile revelation. Cost is legible in the weightless burden he accepts and the deliberate gentleness of his exit. Every structural choice serves the final image: the building keeping vigil, him as its long-awaited witness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The abandoned ticket office isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures choices: dust reveals paths, the wobbling stool limits access, the water-stained tile marks the hiding place. Sensory detail is filtered through the technician’s professional and emotional priorities (popcorn smell, sawdust, moonlight on brass). The setting culminates in the final line—“as if tucking in a child”—which reweights the entire space from ruin to sanctuary. The mainspring barrel and ceiling function as micro-settings that constrain and enable discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering what silence smothers—is signaled early and deepens when dust patterns lead to the drawing. The technician’s agency drives escalation: his choice to reflect light, climb, pry, and finally acknowledge reshapes the ghost’s presence. Cost is felt in the emotional gravity of handling the child’s artifact and the irreversible shift from observer to custodian. Pressure tightens coherently under an Accumulative lens, with each observation narrowing the field to one sacred point beneath the tile.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: ghosts haunt neglect, not places—and witnessing is an act of repair. The final image—the building keeping vigil—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: memory persists where attention returns. Subtext lives in silence, dust, and the pearl button’s gleam; no moral is stated. The technician’s parallel with his unseen daughter (“she’d never seen one”) deepens resonance without sentimentality, making closure feel both personal and universal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is singular: precise, tactile, reverent without piety. Syntax modulates with pressure—longer sentences for observation, shorter for revelation (“He didn’t move for a full minute”). Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices drag-marks, dust curls, light angles. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized, with inference grounded in physical cues (“a sigh woven into the settling of old timber”). Prose rhythm mirrors the ritual of witnessing—measured, deliberate, luminous at climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is purposeful (“dust curled away from the baseboard like fleeing children”) and never muddled. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual breath. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. The only minor slip: “weightless burden” slightly edges toward abstraction but is immediately grounded by concrete action (placing items in evidence bag).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms ghost tropes through specificity: ghosts as dust disturbances, the technician as horological detective, closure via archival care rather than banishment. The synthesis of circus ephemera, forensic observation, and paternal longing feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk: making silence and stillness the climax—and it works. Every detail (pearl button, marquee spelling “C_R_U_”) feels irreplaceable, not decorative.</comment>
