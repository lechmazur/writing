<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The diminutive titan’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her regal restraint, exile-born silence, and strategic patience manifest through micro-choices like folded pages and ciphered marginalia. Her final renunciation (“I am the rune of drift”) is earned by prior causality and carries palpable emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak or unearned epiphanies; emotion is embodied in tactile actions (ink pellet as grief, footfalls swallowed by silence). The protagonist reads as an individual, not a trope, with flaws that complicate rather than resolve her path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she refuses the throne, crystallizing her role as truth’s custodian, with visible cost—the people’s self-inflicted blindness, her hollow justice. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through layered runes, converging witnesses, and the ink’s delayed revelation. Constellations’ pause/resume frames temporal stakes coherently. Cost is legible in the final image—open book, unworn crown, another pellet “just in case”—making before/after undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ancient temple library functions as micro-setting: books as tombstones, dust motes in starlight, vaulted halls—all constrain and enable her tactics (hidden messages, vellum sigil placement). The iron gall ink pellet, recurring object, charges the final image when dissolved in the font. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (cracked marble, starlight older than kingdoms), filtered through her exile-worn perception. Environment directly shapes outcome—without the library’s forgotten tomes, rebellion couldn’t seed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unmasking the pretender—is signaled early and escalates through her cryptic campaign, culminating in the ink’s revelation. Agency is clear: every rune, folded corner, and riddle is her choice, narrowing the pretender’s illusion until it collapses. Cost is unmistakable: years of exile, voicelessness, and the people’s collective shame. Escalation is driven by her patience-turned-action under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: truth as mirror, not weapon; power as burden carried, not worn. The final line—“The crown is not worn. It is carried”—reweights all prior imagery (unclaimed throne, drifting runes) without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence, marginalia, and the pretender’s glowing sigils—no overt allegory. Complexity remains: she declines rule not from purity but weariness, and the people’s complicity isn’t absolved.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors her stealth (“moved like ink bleeding through parchment”). POV is stable third-limited, focalized entirely through her; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is sharp—she notices spines as sentinels, constellations mid-drift—filtered by exile and mission. Diction stays within plausible lexicon; elevated phrases (“velvet tyranny,” “rune of drift”) feel earned, not ornamental.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“iron gall ink pellet... dense as grief”). Figurative language is coherent—ink as bloodline, books as tombstones—and avoids muddle. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats (“graceful collapse of a lie too heavy to stand”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s moss-on-stone image lands with quiet clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise transforms familiar tropes (exiled heir, usurper) through specific, grounded choices: rebellion via library marginalia, truth as slow erosion, crown as carried burden. Emotional truth outweighs novelty—the hollow justice, communal shame—feels human, not archetypal. Risk-taking (accumulative structure, passive climax) heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular: a myth told through dust, ink, and silence.</comment>
