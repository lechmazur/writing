<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The investigator’s motivation—rooted in intergenerational trauma and professional rigor—is rendered with visceral specificity. Her “watchfully calm” demeanor isn’t passive but a practiced discipline that enables her to perceive spectral data others miss. The final act of leaving the lantern as an anchor, etching names on her forearm, embodies Earned Stasis with visible cost. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are channeled through empirical ritual (“measuring echo decay”) that reveals her hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the city’s enforced amnesia is exposed as the true killer, reweighting all prior “routine” investigations. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens via sensory layering (whispers, wool scent, silver light) until the final image crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible in the worker’s death, the mother’s buried trauma, and the protagonist’s permanent marking. Orientation is immediate and functional disorientation (ghostly voices) pays off in the closure’s thematic charge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The subway tunnel functions as micro-setting and haunted archive; its damp bricks, rails, and runoff directly enable spectral perception and constrain action (kneeling on rail, placing lantern). The lantern—treated as both tool and relic—charges the final image when left behind, stilling the air. Sensory detail (wet wool, diesel residue, cold iron) is filtered through the investigator’s professional and ancestral attention. Environment doesn’t just mirror theme—it *is* the conflict’s physical substrate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—breaking the city’s cycle of historical erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the worker’s death is reframed as ancestral dread, not accident. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: her empirical method summons memories, her choice to “show me” triggers the vision, her decision to leave the lantern alters the tunnel’s resonance. Cost is felt in bureaucratic dismissal, inherited trauma, and the weight of names on her skin. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens without reliance on coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the entanglement of infrastructure and memory—progress built on buried pain. The final image (lantern glowing in apartment window, tunnel stilled but not silenced) offers a non-literal answer: witness as repair, not resolution. Avoids moralizing; instead, the inked names and pulsing lantern reprice “evidence” as embodied remembrance. Subtext thrives in silence—the rushing oblivious citizens contrast the protagonist’s fortified vulnerability without authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is singular: forensic lyricism fused with ancestral intuition (“data wrapped in sorrow, physics steeped in trauma”). Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices thermal anomalies before ghosts, measures before mourning. Syntax modulates under pressure: short clauses during vision cascade (“Images cascade: a woman… a man… her own mother”), then steady cadence at closure. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized even amid spectral input, with diction calibrated to her hybrid identity (scientist/conductor descendant).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“boots crunching over grit and discarded bolts” establishes setting and profession in one beat). Figurative language is purposeful and coherent—silver light casts “no shadows, only clarity”—avoiding purple excess. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally (long descriptive sentences punctuated by stark dialogue: “Don’t let them take me back.”). Final line’s heartbeat pulse ties motif to physiology without overstatement.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms the ghost story into a critique of institutional amnesia through a wholly original conceit: spectral resonance as measurable phenomenon. The fusion of Underground Railroad legacy with municipal infrastructure feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking (treating trauma as physics) heightens stakes without gimmickry—the lantern’s cold iron and silver light obey internal rules established early. Every element serves the core question: what happens when a city refuses to mourn?</comment>
