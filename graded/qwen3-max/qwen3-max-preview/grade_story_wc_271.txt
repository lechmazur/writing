<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s trauma is embodied with precision—phantom twinges, crumpled photograph, barefoot grounding—never lapsing into diagnostic abstraction. Contradictory impulses (avoidance vs. witnessing, grief vs. joy) coexist in scene, especially during the freeze. The final renunciation of survival-only artistry for generative sketching feels earned through micro-choices (sitting, crying, drawing). Cost is visible: tears uncounted, vulnerability reclaimed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the narrator stops fleeing memory and begins creating from it. The “Pearl of Stillness” crystallizes a Charged Poise—options reconfigured (sketches left for others), cost felt (ongoing tremors, unhealed loss). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of somatic markers intensifies to cadence shift at dawn return. No causality breaks; every image tightens the thematic coil.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The arboretum isn’t backdrop but active collaborator: ivy swallows benches, vines frame drawings, broken panes fracture light. Body functions as micro-setting—soles register soil, sternum holds stillness. Final image (pearl-dew in spiderweb) charges closure by merging environment, object, and internal state. Salt-crusted benches and storm-bent cypress constrain choice (barefoot walking, shelter-seeking) and mirror psychological wildness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—anchoring optimism in realism—is signaled early and deepens through the freeze, which shifts the photograph from relic to compass. Agency is quiet but decisive: choosing to cry, to draw, to return daily. Cost is legible in phantom pain and unguarded tears. Escalation is textural (density of noticing → creation), not causal, fitting the Accumulative lens perfectly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: ruin/regrowth, terror/tenderness, collapse/green insistence. No moralizing—wisdom arises from sketching roots and leaving gifts. Final image reweights the wedding photo not as loss but motion, answering the central question: Can joy coexist with trauma? Yes, if held like a shell cradling sea-memory without drowning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exquisitely consistent: noticing spirals, gull cries, stitchable silence. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity—longer, lyrical sentences in stillness; clipped phrases during tremors. Voice remains within plausible lexicon (“somatic markers” is justified by therapist reference). No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained throughout. Prose-as-character: rhythm mirrors breath, attention, healing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density: “paper fibers have memorized my fingers’ tremors” does triple duty (object, emotion, embodiment). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent (pearl, shell, compass) and peaks without muddle. Final line (“carry the pearl... in my pulse”) recharges motif with propulsion. Minor deduction for one slightly ornate phrase (“ghostly outline of the old lighthouse beam”), but no artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms drone-strike survivor trope through specificity: wedding context, sister’s laugh, jasmine-gunpowder scent. “Quietly talented” reframed as radical attention. Pearl of Stillness avoids cliché by being dew, not gem—ephemeral yet enduring in memory. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over plot) heightens stakes by making stillness the climax. Vision feels singular, not prompt-derived.</comment>
