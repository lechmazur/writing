<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inspector’s motivation—“purposefully curious”—is embodied in micro-choices (brushing frost, labeling the casing) that reveal a hierarchy of values: bearing witness over data collection. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion manifests through tactile specificity (“throat tight,” “shadow stretching long and thin”). The final renunciation—walking away without looking back—is earned by her prior commitment to vigil rather than utility, with visible cost in solitude and irrelevance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the hourglass’s unreceived message reweights human ingenuity as elegiac rather than functional. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds through sensory layering until dawn’s light triggers the final grain’s dissolution. Cost is legible in the empty casing and the inspector’s silent vow: knowledge exists even when unobserved. Orientation anchors are immediate (“moonlit summit,” “Survey Marker Theta-9”) and serve closure’s thematic weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The moonlit summit functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: vacuum dictates the hourglass’s final trigger, dawn’s thermal spike fractures its shell, and regolith preserves memory. Sensory detail is selective and profession-filtered (“cryo-stabilized film,” “spectral filters”), never touristy. The body (fogged visor, crunching boots) and tool (camera) merge with environment to charge the final image—the shadow as “final signature” ties spatial choreography to thematic closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bearing witness to obsolescence—tightens at 04:57 when the inspector realizes she alone can fulfill the engineers’ intent. Escalation is driven by her agency: kneeling, photographing, labeling. The cost is conceptual yet palpable: her communion replaces documentation, and the message’s deliberate unreadability becomes the point. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, culminating in Charged Poise—she carries the image “in marrow,” not film.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the hourglass’s design: human cleverness meant to outlast its audience. Subtext thrives in silence, frost, and chemical sighs—not moralizing. The ending reweights prior material: “Some things aren’t meant to be seen. They’re meant to be known” offers a non-literal answer to the central question of legacy. Complexity endures—beauty persists precisely because it’s unreceived, resisting sentimentality through lunar indifference.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled first-person limited, with perceptual signature rooted in scientific lyricism (“sodium metasilicate layered with lunar ilmenite”). Syntax modulates under pressure: short clauses at climax (“Beautiful, she thought. A message wrapped in erosion.”). No head-hopping; voice remains consistent even in reflection. Diction stays within plausible lexicon—technical terms serve character, not exposition—and rhythm mirrors lunar stillness then dawn’s arrival.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“Her camera... clicked softly as she framed the hourglass against the bleeding dawn”). Figurative language is coherent (“chemical sigh,” “dawnlit melancholy”) and never muddled. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Closure beat (“You outlasted them all”) resonates without overwriting, though one minor register lift (“marrow”) slightly edges poetic convention.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing celestial chronometry, chemical messaging, and lunar archaeology into a fresh elegy for obsolete care. The premise transforms tropes of last witnesses and dying tech through specific world logic (vacuum-triggered reactions) and moral calculus (building messages knowing no one will hear). Risk-taking—foregrounding silence over spectacle—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular: a requiem for precision engineered to vanish.</comment>
