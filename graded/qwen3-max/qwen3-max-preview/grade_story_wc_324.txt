<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tracer’s motivation—protecting vulnerable voices—is embodied through micro-choices (kneeling at distance, broadcasting resonance) that reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The girl’s fractured state is rendered without therapy-speak, her silence more potent than dialogue. Both characters feel individuated: the tracer’s competence is balanced by emotional labor fatigue; the girl’s trauma manifests in physical stillness, not melodrama. Their final hand-clasp earns closure through prior causality, not sentiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the girl accepts her parents won’t return but is anchored by love’s enduring frequency—a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (abandoning hope for reunion). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, validated by escalating sensory density (mist → condensation → lilies → heartbeat static) that reweights the stake. Orientation anchors firmly by line 3 (“contact tracer for hearts,” “atrium at twilight”). Every beat tightens pressure toward the girl’s revelation without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atrium functions as micro-setting: wet stone and velvet ropes constrain movement; the cracked fountain supplies lilies that mirror surrender. Crucially, the hearing aid and photograph—tools as setting—charge the final image when their pulses synchronize. Sensory hierarchy reflects the tracer’s professional bias (noticing marble veins, tarnish on brass). Weather (mist, twilight) evolves causally, thinning only after emotional resolution, proving environment isn’t backdrop but active participant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—answering the dead’s summons to prevent hauntings—is signaled early and deepens when the tracer shifts from listening to broadcasting, narrowing her tactic under urgency. The girl’s whispered “They told me to wait” raises stakes by revealing decades of limbo. Cost is legible: the tracer expends emotional labor to recalibrate reality for a ghost, accepting she can’t restore life but can validate love’s persistence. No coincidence resolves conflict; agency drives every turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: love as frequency that changes but doesn’t die, validated by the hearing aid’s counter-pulse. The final image—walking toward exit with calm photograph—reweights the premise non-literally: heroism is quiet co-presence, not rescue. Avoids moralizing; subtext lives in gestures (girl’s twitching fingers, tracer’s ash-low voice). Complexity endures—the parents are gone forever—but resonance offers bittersweet reconfiguration, not tidy solace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: the tracer notices “marble veined with forgotten histories” and “brass casing tarnished green,” filtering world through emotional archaeology. Rhythmic control under pressure shines in the colonnade chase (“rhythm stuttered, then surged—a panicked flutter”), varying sentence length to mirror heartbeat. No head-hopping; single POV remains consistent even during the girl’s dialogue. Voice modulates from curiosity to urgency to tenderness without register drift or filter-verb stacks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose avoids overwriting: metaphors (“lilies floated like surrendered hands”) serve theme without muddle. Information density is high—e.g., “syncopated ache only she could interpret” conveys profession, isolation, and sensory specificity in one phrase. Minor deduction for slight figurative density in opening paragraph (“mist-clad atrium,” “marble veined,” “bruised twilight”), though pattern pays off in closure’s “mist thinned.” No loops, scaffold, or simultaneity errors; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms tropes (ghost stories, contact tracing) through grounded specificity: emotional resonance as measurable frequency, heroism as tuning broken devices. The core concept—love changing frequency—feels inevitable yet fresh, synthesized from hearing aid mechanics and photograph’s vibration. Risk-taking (lyric structure, abstract stakes) heightens meaning without gimmickry; no near-echoes of famous works. Authentic vision coheres voice, concept, and closure into singular artistic stance.</comment>
