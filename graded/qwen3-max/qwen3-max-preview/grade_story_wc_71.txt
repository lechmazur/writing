<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motivation—to understand why houses feel alive—is embodied through tactile, sensory rituals rather than exposition. Her internal contradiction (tracking creeping normality while sanctifying loss) manifests in micro-choices: placing the shard, pressing her palm, walking barefoot. Emotions are rendered through concrete textures (“velvet curtains,” “chalk drawing beneath paint”) avoiding diagnostic language. The final renunciation—leaving the shard to dissolve—earns an Earned Stasis with visible cost: she accepts impermanence, yet continues her work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (shard, hush, thresholds) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration: the vanished cottage “unclenches its ghostly fingers.” Cost is legible in the closing image—the shard dissolves, but sanctification lingers as emotional and atmospheric change. Orientation is immediate (“barefoot along the quiet bay in spring”), and the single scene tightens around one meaningful deepening: the act of placement reweights memory as sacred. Closure lands with conceptual cost: honoring requires release, not preservation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The bay functions as micro-setting and emotional scaffold—moss-slick stone, salt-kissed air, dew-laden rock—all constrain and charge the protagonist’s ritual. The orris root shard acts as object-as-setting, its scent-memory (“ghost-notes of violet and damp earth”) directly enabling the climax. Final image is charged by environment: streetlights “lean closer,” tide carries molecules back to soil. Every sensory detail serves the thematic pulse—no postcard description; setting breathes with the houses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—sanctifying forgotten architectures—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s intentional placement of the shard. Agency is expressed through attention and ritual, not confrontation; her choice to leave the shard forecloses preservation but enables release. Pressure escalates texturally: from whispered reeds to suspended gulls to the “hushed blaze” in her chest. Cost is unmistakable: the cottage’s spirit departs, and she walks on, barefoot and alone, bearing the weight of remembrance without possession.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as architecture, reverence as navigation, not resistance, to time’s creep. Subtext thrives in silence, placement, and dissolution—never moralized. The ending offers a non-literal answer: some houses live because they’re loved beyond their time, and sanctification is an act of letting go. Final line (“keep walking… heart alight with hushed blaze”) reweights the entire premise—normality isn’t defeated but walked beside, with eyes open. No platitudes; wisdom arises from chalk dust, chamomile steam, and dissolving root.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is exquisitely controlled—third-person limited fused with lyrical interiority. Voice modulates rhythmically: long, flowing sentences for reflection (“scent as architecture, aroma as emotional scaffolding”), short cadences for intensity (“The bay stilled. Even the gulls paused mid-cry”). Perceptual signature is distinct: she notices thresholds, breath-held hallways, blinking windows. No head-hopping, no register drift—diction remains poetic yet grounded (“butter-yellow glow,” “sliver of suspended time”). Elision is purposeful; every image serves the accumulative drive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence multitasks (e.g., “silence pooled like spilled ink” establishes tone, setting, and metaphor). Figurative language is coherent: hush as “pollen on ribs,” presence as “heartbeat pressed against glass.” No loops or scaffold; syntax varies naturally. Minor deduction for slight overuse of metaphor in mid-section (“emotional scaffolding,” “breadcrumb for the soul”), but none obscure causality or dull closure. Final paragraph’s rhythm—short clauses, then expansive resolve—mirrors the thematic cadence perfectly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: “creeping normality” as observable tide, sanctification via displaced objects, houses as sentient through collective memory. Tropes (ghost houses, memory shards) are transformed by specificity—orrice root’s botany, chalk beneath paint, porch swings in windless dark. Bold risk: a plotless, ritual-driven narrative that earns emotional stakes through texture alone. Vision is singular—quiet, reverent, anti-nostalgic. Originality lies not in concept but in execution: every image feels inevitable, irreplaceable, and deeply human.</comment>
