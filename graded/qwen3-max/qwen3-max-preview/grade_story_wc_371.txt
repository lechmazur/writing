<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her grief, ritual, and quiet rebellion arise from specific sensory memory (the bakery’s bell, flour-dusted smile) rather than abstraction. Her micro-choices (offering bread, uncloaking, planting seeds) reveal a hierarchy of values: sacred attention over spectacle. The final act—wearing spring wheat after seasons in gray—feels earned through accumulated emotional weight, not epiphany. No diagnostic label-speak; even “creeping normality” is dramatized as lived erosion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she refuses to let beauty be erased, foreclosing passive grief with guerrilla gardening and uncloaking, at the cost of vulnerability (no birds to take the offering, no guarantee seeds grow). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via recurring motifs (bread, ivy, silence) until the final drip reweights everything. Orientation anchors instantly (“barefoot through overgrown palace courtyard”), and causality flows through tactile beats, not summary. Cost is legible in the untouched bread and hardened crust—old promises left to decompose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting is active crucible: vines swallow statues, moss muffles footsteps, wisteria buries the tea house—each detail constrains movement and amplifies silence. The courtyard isn’t backdrop but antagonist and sanctuary; its decay pressures her ritual (kneeling by cracked fountain, warped floorboards). Final image—the hidden spring stirred—charges closure by proving the earth responds to her defiance. Every sensory cue (damp soil, spider silk, rustling leaves) filters through her trauma and hope, never tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—permission from the earth to feel sacred again—is signaled early and deepens through her actions. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: from passive noticing (“learns truth hides in slow dissolve”) to active resistance (guerrilla gardening, uncloaking). The tightening is decisive: she moves from offering bread (question) to planting seeds (defiance), narrowing options from waiting to creating. Cost is felt in stale bread and empty teacups—sacrifices with no audience, only earth as witness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through image and action: the sacred resides in crumb, seed, and uncloaking—not cathedrals. No moralizing; the final drip reweights all prior loss as fertile ground. Subtext thrives in silence (untouched bread, dark lanterns) and gesture (brushing soil from knees). The central question—can beauty persist amid erasure?—is answered non-literally by wildflowers pressed into cracks, making forgetting an act of violence she refuses.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is singularly lyrical yet precise—“heuristically gentle,” “grammar of absolution”—with rhythm modulating from meditative (long sentences tracing vines) to taut (short clauses during uncloaking). Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices decay’s textures (yellowed wax paper, chipped saucer) because they echo emotional states. No head-hopping; free indirect thought blends seamlessly (“she knows patience is the grammar…”). Diction stays within her poetic-but-grounded lexicon—no register drift even in peak emotion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: “crust hardened like old promises” does character, setting, and theme in five words. Zero loops or scaffold—every sentence propels. Figurative language is coherent (ivy absorbs laughter, silence steeps like tea) and peaks without muddle. Final paragraph’s cadence—short, breath-like sentences—mirrors her deeper breathing, tying syntax to emotional shift. Only minor deduction: one slightly stacked modifier (“flour-dusted smile”) risks preciousness, but earns its place through specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms familiar tropes (ruined palace, vanished bakery) through hyper-specific rituals (bread offering, seed defiance) that feel inevitable yet fresh. The “creeping normality noticer” reframes grief as environmental awareness—a non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over plot) heightens stakes by making every moss patch a battlefield. No derivative echoes; authenticity pulses in details like jasmine-tea sipping from a cracked cup while twilight softens stone.</comment>
