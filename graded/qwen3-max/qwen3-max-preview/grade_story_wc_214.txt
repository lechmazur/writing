<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The janitor’s interiority is vividly embodied—his tactile relationship with the lantern glass, his breath caught at the comet’s efflorescence, his tears of recognition—all reveal a hierarchy of values centered on reverence for impermanence. His motivation (to find strength in vulnerability) is dramatized through micro-choices: kneeling to trace the rogue comet’s arc, sweeping dust as benediction. The backstory of his transfer from the Grand Archive is anchored in present stimuli (the lantern) and tilts his stance without flattening pressure. His flaws—withdrawal, quiet defiance—are consistent and shape his credible endurance (Earned Stasis).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): he reaffirms his role by returning to sweeping after witnessing unrecorded peace, foreclosing any return to institutional astronomy with visible cost (isolation, obscurity). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—density builds via layered images of dust, light, and surrender until the rogue comet’s silent bloom reweights “flourishing stillness” as active witnessing. Cost is legible in the final image: tears on weathered cheeks, the patched tunic, the station’s analog hum. Orientation is immediate (“cosmic janitor,” “Andromeda Drift,” “observation deck”) and serves closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The yellow lantern glass functions as micro-setting: it constrains how he perceives meteors (filtering streaks into golden threads) and charges the final image (glowing faintly as a beacon of reverence). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—crystalline floor whispering, wind-chime sensors humming, velvet dark—never touristy. The shooting star tracking station’s obsolete analog dials and forgotten location pressure his renunciation of institutional validation. Every atmospheric detail mirrors his thematic stance: entropy as release, collapse as sacred.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honoring celestial vulnerability through presence—is signaled early and tightens when the rogue comet demands interpretation over prediction. The meaningful deepening occurs when he chooses empathy over protocol, tracing intent rather than impact, which crystallizes his stance under Accumulative pressure. Cost is felt in his isolation (“They called him mad”) and embodied in his tears and patched tunic. Agency is clear: his attention itself is the act that forecloses detachment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the lantern glass, comet-dust, archival glass—all accrue meaning through use, not assertion. The ending offers a non-literal answer to “How do we face impermanence?”: by holding space for unrecorded beauty, strength arises in surrender. Subtext operates in silence (sensors register nothing), gesture (wiping tears with tunic hem), and image (lantern glowing as beacon of reverence). No moralizing; wisdom is earned through the janitor’s lived ritual.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is singular—a lyrical, cosmic-weary third-person limited that modulates rhythm with emotional intensity (short sentences during comet plunge, flowing cadence in reflection). Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices color as soul, motion as psalm, dust as residue of farewells. No head-hopping; psychic distance remains intimate yet restrained. Prose-as-character: syntax mirrors deep-space breathing—unhurried, rhythmic, with precise verbs (“fraying,” “unraveled,” “efflorescence”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“Empathy was his compass”; “Flourishing stillness”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (light as psalm, dust as benediction) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in “blue-white shard tumbling end over end, its brilliance fraying”—slightly ornate but legible under voice. Zero loops or scaffold; information density high (“patched tunic,” “wind-chime sensors,” “gravitational sigh”). Final line (“He kept sweeping”) resonates with opening broom whisper.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Transforms the “lonely watcher” trope through specific, grounded choices: janitorial labor as sacred practice, vulnerability as radiant armor, unrecorded events as most meaningful. The synthesis of spiritual curiosity, obsolete tech, and cosmic scale feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk: prioritizing quiet witnessing over discovery, with no dialogue or external conflict—yet stakes feel urgent. Authentic vision: every element coheres around “flourishing stillness” without abstraction.</comment>
