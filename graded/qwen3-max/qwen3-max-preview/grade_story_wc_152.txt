<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The embroiderer’s interiority is richly embodied—her needlework as cognition, her surrender to the flame’s rhythm as strategy. Her disguise of wisdom as foolishness drives key tactical choices with visible cost (e.g., conspirators dismissing her tapestries). Contradictory impulses—artistic devotion vs. political urgency—act simultaneously in high-pressure beats. Final renunciation (sleeping post-victory) earns closure through sustained causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she endures, foreclosing anonymity at great personal risk, and the cobalt flame’s steadiness confirms adjacent possibilities collapsed into her truth. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via stitched patterns until the solstice coup fractures, then reconfigures. Cost is legible in the final image: loyalty preserved, power shifted, all through thread. No causality breaks; every beat tightens pressure toward that charged poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory isn’t backdrop—it’s micro-setting that constrains choice: cliff-edge isolation enables secrecy; autumn light thins perception, mirroring political blindness. The eternal candle functions as tool and compass, its tremor dictating stitch timing. Final image charges the setting: once a place of silent watching, now a sanctuary of stitched truth. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—visual silk constellations dominate early, tactile aurora strands intensify mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving royal truth against coup—is signaled early and tightens at the flame’s shudder, which triggers her dimensional leap. Agency is clear: she chooses synchronization over flight, deception over declaration. Cost is unmistakable: she risks being labeled mad while weaving decoys that save lives. Escalation stems from her actions, not coincidence—the crimson stitch directly reveals the conspiracy masked as meteor showers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: unheard stories surface not via proclamation but through thread, flame, and quiet courage. Final image reweights the premise—wisdom need not shout—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in negative space: sanctuaries mapped between constellations, lies stitched to save truths. No tidy binaries; conspirators are arrogant but human, loyalty costly but unglamorous.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is exquisitely calibrated—lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature that filters cosmos through needle and flame. Syntax modulates under pressure: longer, fluid sentences during stitching; fragmented urgency during dimensional shift (“She returned, gasping”). No head-hopping; single POV remains stable even in adjacent possibilities. Elision is pattern-taught early (“listen for unheard stories”) and paid off in closure’s echoed silence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is patterned and purposeful (e.g., “needle flashing like a comet’s tail” → “silver filament drawn from the candle’s own wick”). No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Minor density in high-pressure beats (flame shudders described twice) costs 0.3, but clarity at closure remains pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesis: embroidery as intelligence-gathering, aurora strands as dimensional conduits, foolishness as camouflage. Tropes (court intrigue, hidden savior) are transformed by specific craft logic. Risk-taking—non-causal escalation via resonance—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular: a quiet war waged in silk, where thread outmaneuvers steel.</comment>
