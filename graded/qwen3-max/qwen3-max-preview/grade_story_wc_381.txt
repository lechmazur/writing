<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The summoner’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied perception (“knees damp with dew and resolve,” “heartbeat syncing with rustle of ferns”) rather than diagnostic labels. Her motivation—to hush a prophecy by listening, not silencing—emerges organically from trauma (the wind-whisperer’s dissolution) and deepens into a renunciation of control. The final choice to become a vessel for coded cries feels inevitable yet costly, crystallizing her identity as listener over savior. No emotional summarization; every insight arises from tactile ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the prophecy reframes from doom to plea, reweighting the sky’s “forgetting” as a call for guardianship. Cost is legible in the summoner’s damp knees, bare feet, and nightly returns—endurance as Earned Stasis that forecloses easier paths. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: density builds via sensory layering (“murmur flowed not as sound but as texture”) until the crane’s wing pulsed with “constellations shaped like lullabies.” No causality breaks; every image tightens the thematic coil.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven isn’t backdrop but active crucible: brook’s lullaby cadence syncs the summoner’s breath, moss-root air shapes her stillness, and water’s surface becomes altar for the origami wing. Crucially, the setting constrains tactics—silence must be mapped *here*, where earth listens—and charges closure as stars lean closer to hear. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: moonlight as liquid, sound as texture, silence as “velvet void.” Every detail serves the Accumulative lens without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preventing the sky’s forgetting—is signaled early and deepens when the prophecy reveals itself as a plea, not a threat. The tightening occurs when the summoner shifts from silencing to cradling, narrowing options to perpetual vigilance (“return tomorrow, and the night after”). Cost is felt in her resolve-damp knees and barefoot commitment; agency drives escalation as she flows into the whisper, altering the prophecy’s fate through attention alone. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: true guardianship lies in listening, not controlling. The crane’s wing—first a vessel for unsaid futures, then a carrier of lullaby-light—reweights silence from absence to reverence. Final image offers non-literal answer: stars absorb sorrow to weave “gentler patterns,” proving the earth’s listening heals the sky. No moralizing; resonance blooms from particulars (drowned bells → constellations, origami fibers drinking moonlight). Complexity endures—prophecy’s code stems from truth’s unbearable weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is singular: the summoner notices through synesthetic filters (“murmur as texture,” “silence as velvet void”), and prose rhythm mirrors her cadence—long, flowing sentences slowing to breath-pauses at climax. Voice remains consistent in elevated diction because it’s character-bound (a summoner trained by wind-whisperers). No head-hopping; focalization stays tight within her sensory field. Elision is purposeful (“not in words, but in breath… hollow between heartbeats”) and pays off in closure’s charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves near-flawless density: each line advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“paper fibers drinking moonlight like roots drink rain”). Figurative language is coherent—water as cosmic stitch, silence as second skin—and never muddles peak beats. Sentence openings vary (“She had come…”, “Flow was…”, “Her breath slowed…”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Minor deduction for slight overuse of em-dashes in mid-text, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift dulls the closure’s “tranquil blaze.”</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms prophecy tropes through specificity: the summoner’s method (mapping silence) and tool (origami older than trees) feel irreplaceable. Core premise—a sky forgetting dawn—gains freshness via emotional calculus: truth too heavy for direct tongue must be cradled like a fledgling. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure, no dialogue) heightens stakes by making silence the protagonist. Vision coheres fully; removing any element (e.g., “terrestrially cosmic rhythm”) would fracture the conceptual spine.</comment>
