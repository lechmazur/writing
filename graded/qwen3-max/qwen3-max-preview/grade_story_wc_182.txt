<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is concrete and linguistically embodied; her contradictions—between scholarly patience and urgent purpose—manifest in micro-choices like kneeling to listen rather than extract. Kael’s disorientation reads as authentic temporal trauma, not exposition. Their dynamic crystallizes under pressure without head-hopping or diagnostic self-awareness. The final renunciation of extraction-as-rescue feels earned through prior linguistic philosophy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “rescue is reconciliation,” with visible cost in Kael’s fractured chrono-core harmonizing only after mindset shift. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of linguistic imagery builds to the hollow-codex revelation. Orientation anchors firmly by line 30; causality flows via semantic logic, not coincidence. Every lacuna functions as a taught door, paid off at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The mountain-bookstore constrains every choice: gravity stutters where syntax breaks, shelves rearrange to signal comprehension, and the hollow codex replaces physical text. Sensory hierarchy prioritizes tactile (petals, ozone, crumbling spines) over visual, reflecting Elira’s profession. Final image—semantic blossoms pressing into diary—is charged by recurring botanical motif. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent even during reality shifts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redefining rescue—tightens when Elira rejects extraction for renegotiation, foreclosing Kael’s original mission with conceptual cost. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her research into gaps directly enables the climax. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each linguistic detail deepens the central question. The chrono-core’s stabilization proves stakes were viscerally felt, not abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from semantic struggle: rescue as removal vs. reconciliation, taught through botanical diary and chrono-core. Final sentence—“the library... turned a page”—reweights all prior images without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (“listen to dislocated verbs”) and absence (hollow codex). Ambiguity lingers (will they stay? teach?), but complexity never confuses.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: Elira notices linguistic strata, not titles; Kael perceives time as flickering pupils. Voice modulates rhythmically—longer sentences for contemplation, fragmented beats during gravity stutter. No head-hopping; dual focalizers remain distinct yet converge intentionally at closure. Diction stays within arcane linguist lexicon (“subjunctive branches,” “semantic blooms”) without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose maintains high information density: “syntax that bent causality” does worldbuilding, character, and theme in five words. Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors cohere (tuning fork, metronome, symphony). Sentence openings vary naturally; paragraph cuts always shift knowledge or pressure. Minor deduction: “fractured chrono-core, pulsing erratically like a dying metronome” slightly over-modifies, but clarity remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: linguistics as temporal physics, rescue as grammatical negotiation. Tropes (time travelers, sentient books) transformed through precise semantic logic. Bold risk—making grammar the antagonist—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable: every petal, gap, and verb root scaffolds the CR. Irreplaceable specificity: only an arcane linguist could solve this.</comment>
