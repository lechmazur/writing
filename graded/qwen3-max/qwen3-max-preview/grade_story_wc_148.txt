<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The boy’s motivation—threading his story before bodies are found—is compelling and rooted in generational mistrust. His internal conflict (truth vs. disbelief) manifests physically through trembling hands, shallow breath, and embodied dread. The final act of kneeling and saying “I believe you” is a credible renunciation of his lineage’s curse, earned by prior pressure. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion stays tactile and contradictory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the lighthouse beam now carries truth as luminous testimony, reweighting the premise that cries go unheard. Cost is legible—the boy’s exhaustion, his surrender to being called mad—and the drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds throughout. Orientation anchors firmly by line 2. Every beat tightens toward the lattice’s activation, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison, reef, and salt-crusted stones aren’t backdrop—they constrain every move. The lattice functions as micro-setting: its warped slats, candle-wax air, and brine taste directly enable the climax. Final image (“light… hovering in the air like breath before a kiss”) is charged by environment. Sensory hierarchy narrows under stress (palms slick, wind gnawing), then expands at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—making silenced truth visible—is signaled early and deepens via the boy’s agency: he chooses to wedge the lattice, press it into the lens, seal voices into light. Each action forecloses escape or anonymity. Cost is unmistakable: dawn arrives as search party nears; he accepts being branded mad. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of whispers intensifies until light fractures meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme—truth dismissed as fiction until made undeniable—emerges through concrete acts, not moralizing. The lattice’s transformation from confessional relic to truth-conduit reweights all prior “cries.” Final image offers non-literal resolution: ships carry “unsilenced truth… sustained, gentle,” rejecting redemption for resonance. No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers (Are they ghosts? Witnesses?), yet cost is clear.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled single-third, with a perceptual signature steeped in maritime decay and inherited shame. Voice modulates rhythmically: short, tense clauses during entry (“breath shallow, palms slick”), lyrical cadence at climax (“hover… like breath before a kiss”). No head-hopping; diction stays within lexicon (“copperlight repose,” “tide-scoured rock”). Elision is purposeful—backstory compressed into “father’s legacy was a noose”—and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“air tasted of brine and candle wax, thick with ghosts of confessions never absolved”) and varied syntax. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats (“wind gnawed,” “groaning like a throat”) slightly dilutes propulsion but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors thematic stasis. One paraphrase risk (“fractured glow” / “fractured light”) but not repetitive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms “cry wolf” trope through generational trauma, object-based magic realism, and institutional silence. The lattice-as-truth-amplifier feels inevitable in hindsight, grounded in chapel debris and lighthouse mechanics. Risk-taking (ghosts as witnesses, not spirits) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision is singular: truth isn’t shouted but sustained—a quiet, luminous persistence.</comment>
