<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mender’s interiority is vividly embodied—her calloused hands, frayed ribbon, and stubborn hope reveal contradiction without therapy-speak. Her micro-choices (coaxing the vow with honey, stitching it to the ribbon) align precisely with her belief in repair over redemption. The daughter’s off-page presence exerts credible pressure through artifacts and memory. Final renunciation isn’t tidy; she persists not for reconciliation but because tending wisdom across generations is her irreducible duty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the green scrap signals return without resolution, reconfiguring hope as active tending rather than passive waiting. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—vows accrue like fruit, and the final image reweights all prior gathering. Cost is legible in the mender’s solitude, the unharvested pears, and the daughter’s hesitant footprints. Every beat tightens around the central act of retrieval and repair.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The orchard-cathedral fusion isn’t backdrop—it actively supplies vows as physical objects, constrains movement (ivy ladders, thorned doorways), and dictates tools (honey for sticky promises). Sensory detail is selective: gold/crimson leaves from magic, not autumn; pear branches groaning under unharvested weight. The setting charges the final image—the green scrap caught on a wild rose thorn ties environment to emotional possibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bridging generational wisdom before it’s lost—is signaled early and deepens when the daughter’s vow appears fresh on the branch. Escalation is protagonist-driven: she climbs, improvises with spoon and honey, and stitches vow to ribbon. Cost is felt in silence, exile, and the daughter’s initial rejection; the green scrap offers not resolution but renewed pressure to persist. Coincidence never resolves; every advance is earned by grit and unorthodox method.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: repair as intergenerational labor, not redemption. The recurring ribbon shifts from symbol of loss to vessel of stitched-together hope. Final image—green scrap on thorn—offers non-literal answer: wisdom grows in returns, however tentative. No moralizing; resonance arises from quartz lenses, silver thread, and deciduous vows that shed like foliage, making abstraction tactile.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature that notices “deciduous vows” and “stubborn as a root cracking pavement.” Syntax modulates—longer sentences for reflection, tighter phrases for action (“She sighed, then grinned”). No head-hopping; single POV remains anchored in the mender’s sensory world. Elision is purposeful (dream sequence compressed), and closure pays off the taught pattern of vows as harvestable fruit.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid—each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language is consistent (“vows curled like maple leaves,” “ribbon fluttering like captured sky”) without muddle. Rhythm varies: humming swells “through the nave like a forgotten hymn,” while footprints are “small, hesitant.” No loops or scaffold; even minor artifacts (“forgotten bag’s contents” repeated) serve thematic emphasis, not redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise transforms familiar tropes—exiled artisan, mother-daughter rift—through the original conceit of “deciduous vows” made visible in an orchard-cathedral. Tools (bent spoon, honey) feel specific and necessary, not quirky. Emotional truth outweighs novelty: the daughter’s feistiness mirrors the mother’s, making their conflict intimate, not archetypal. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over causality) heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
