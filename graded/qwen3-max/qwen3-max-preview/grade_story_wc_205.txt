<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The defunct revolutionary’s interiority is richly embodied—his poetic inclination emerges not as affectation but as erosion of purpose, each metaphor a “tombstone for ideals.” His micro-choices (covering mirrors, transcribing haiku on silk) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on listening over spectacle. The arrival of Voss tests his isolation without flattening his agency; their collaboration feels earned, not convenient. His final realization—that the real rebellion is against forgetting—is rooted in prior behavior and carries the cost of abandoning triumph for translation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: time’s visibility shifts from spectacle to scripture, reweighting the entire premise with social cost (the archaeological dispute continues, but meaning is reclaimed). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density increases via glyphs, storms, and haiku until the ceiling blooms with full poems. Cost is legible in the protagonist’s renunciation of victory for fragile co-creation. Every beat tightens around the shard’s refracted truth, culminating in Charged Poise beneath velvet-draped stillness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid isn’t backdrop—it constrains choice: low gravity shapes dust motes, gilt balconies frame dawn, fossilized starlight veins marble under Voss’s boots. The crystal shard functions as micro-setting, its refractions dictating when and how the past speaks. Time-streams pulse visibly, making history tangible yet contested, directly enabling the glyphs’ emergence. The final image—stellar dawn on gilt balconies—charges the closure by contrasting cosmic scale with intimate transcription.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decoding lost utopia through silence between artifacts—is signaled early and deepens when Voss confirms harmonic resonance. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: covering mirrors isn’t superstition but tactical innovation that steadies glyphs. Cost is unmistakable—he abandons the revolution’s legacy to pursue fragile, unverifiable truth. The chrono-wind storm forces a trade-off: reflectivity versus clarity, spectacle versus scripture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: civilization measured in shared silence, leadership in listening, legacy in unfinished songs. The ending offers a non-literal answer—the real rebellion is translation, not conquest—reweighting the barricades’ failure as misdirected energy. Subtext thrives in negative space: truth resides not in archives but in erasures, not in monuments but in living questions. No moralizing; resonance arises from glyphs blooming into poems only when mirrors are veiled.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is exquisitely calibrated: lyrical but precise, with a perceptual signature that notices “fossilized starlight” and “ghost-letters.” Syntax modulates under pressure—long, baroque sentences fracture during storms, then settle into haiku cadence. Free indirect style merges the revolutionary’s poetic erosion with narrative texture (“each metaphor a tombstone”). No head-hopping; Voss’s skepticism sharpens his interiority without intrusion. The final haiku crystallizes voice and theme without didacticism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “rosary of regrets,” “chrono-winds howled like widows,” “velvet drapes stitched from comet-tail silk” avoid purple excess by grounding metaphor in character need. Minor overwriting in “gilded ruin of the baroque asteroid’s grand salon”—three adjectives where two suffice—but never muddles causality. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve rhythm (e.g., single-line haiku). Final line’s “alive, not in triumph, but in translation” earns its weight through accumulated specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing archaeology, visible time, and poetic epistemology into a coherent vision. Tropes—revolutionary regret, lost utopia—are transformed by concrete mechanics: mirrors multiply time’s fractures, silence measures wealth. The core premise feels inevitable in hindsight yet fresh: truth in negative space, rebellion as anti-forgetting. Risk-taking (lyric structure, conceptual time) heightens stakes without gimmickry; every detail serves the reimagining imperative.</comment>
