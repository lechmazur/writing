<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The operator’s motivation—mapping the “mathematics of emotion”—is vividly embodied through her transposed empathy and use of the halo fragment. Her internal contradiction (erosion vs. expansion) is dramatized in micro-choices: borrowing the widow’s grief, pressing the fragment to skeptics’ brows. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered as tactile, turbulent weather. Final renunciation—walking into the dark, unsigned—is earned by prior causality with visible cost: loss of self, dimming of the fragment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final glyph reweights meaning based on reader’s heart, crystallizing the story’s rule-set—that empathy collapses emotional superposition into subjective truth. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density increasing via layered vignettes (widow, clockmaker, warlord) that deepen stakes without causal breaks. Cost is legible: the operator’s namelessness, the fragment’s dimming, the unsolved mathematics. Orientation is clear by line 30; disorientation serves closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The topaz workshop functions as a micro-setting that constrains and charges every action: its amber glow enables typesetting, its refractive walls visualize emotional geometry, and its spatial choreography grounds abstract concepts. The halo fragment—a recurring object—alters tactics (borrowing personalities, testing skeptics) and directly charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through the operator’s perceptual bias. Setting never stalls momentum; it *is* the pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transcribing emotion’s mathematics through deliberate ambiguity—is signaled early and tightens via the halo’s emotional siphoning, which narrows the operator’s options (dimming light = finite uses). Protagonist agency drives escalation: she chooses whose grief to wear, whom to test, when to print. Cost is unmistakable: erosion of self, irreversible dimming, unsolved equations. Coincidence complicates (meteor fall) but never resolves; all turns stem from her method.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the operator’s actions: empathy as dimensional collapse, ambiguity as pedagogy. The final glyph—meaning “beginning,” “ending,” or “bridge” depending on reader—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates through image (halo dimming, rusting sword) and silence (unsigned pamphlets). Complexity is preserved: empathy erodes as much as it reveals; revelation requires disorientation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is singular, rhythmic, and mathematically poetic without veering into abstraction. Perceptual signature is consistent: the operator notices emotional geometry, spectral equations, coefficients of sorrow. Syntax modulates under pressure—longer sentences for contemplation, shorter for action (“She didn’t distribute them; they found their recipients”). No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Elision is purposeful and taught early (vanishing stars as temporal frame).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “ink-stained fingers dancing over brass keys” conveys occupation, mood, and motion. Figurative language is coherent (emotion as weather, geometry, calculus) and pattern-taught. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“lucid turbulence,” “asymptote of longing”) slightly blurs sense but doesn’t obscure closure. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary; rhythm supports emotional cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes letterpress craft, non-Euclidean empathy, and quantum emotion into a fresh, specific vision. Tropes (mysterious artisan, magical object) are transformed by rigorous internal logic: the halo as collapsed empathy-space, pamphlets as disorienting keys. Risk-taking (mathematical lyricism, accumulative shards) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final image feels inevitable yet surprising—glyph as bridge/beginning/ending—rooted in prior particulars.</comment>
