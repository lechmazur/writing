<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her aromatically cautious nature, grief for extinct scents, and fear of beauty’s pain shape every micro-choice. Her final decision to open the vial and embrace memory feels earned through consistent traits and escalating emotional pressure. The transformation from resistance to acceptance carries visible cost: the surrender of protective numbness. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through sensory perception and physical reaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she redefines her role from hoarder of grief to broker of remembrance, with the empty vial now a compass. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—density builds via scent, light, and glyph until the UV beam crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible in her buckled knees, weeping, and the lanterns’ reawakening. Orientation anchors are immediate (“greenhouse for extinct plants,” “lantern broker”), and causality flows through sensory triggers to revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as both setting and crucible—its preserved extinction pressures her grief and enables the ritual. The crystal vial, lanterns, and UV lamp are micro-settings that constrain and charge choices: gloves withheld, cap unscrewed, light aimed at air. Sensory hierarchy reflects her profession—smell dominates, then sight under UV—and tactile details (moss-stained tiles, trembling precision) ground abstraction. Final image of trailing crystal shadows ties environment to emotional transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding why smells trigger tears—is signaled early and deepens into a confrontation with encoded grief. The tightening occurs when she opens the vial despite decades of caution, narrowing her path from preservation to release. Agency drives escalation: her choice to deploy the UV lamp transforms passive mourning into active decoding. Cost is felt in bodily collapse and emotional exposure, reweighting her entire vocation by story’s end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: grief is memory’s guardian, not its enemy. This insight arises from concrete particulars—the vial, glyphs, lanterns—not abstraction. The ending offers a non-literal answer to her childhood question through resonant images (glowing lanterns, compass-vial), reweighting all prior moments without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and the ultraviolet rendering of intangible memory into visible script.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is singular, lyrical, and precise—filtered through a perfumer’s hyper-awareness of scent and volatility. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer, fluid sentences for reflection; fractured urgency during the glyph vision. POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping or omniscience. Diction (“aromatically cautious,” “crystal shadows”) is character-specific, and the perceptual signature—noticing scent before sight, handling vials with ritual care—never wavers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “faceted like frozen tears” conveys form, emotion, and motif. Figurative language is coherent—light, glass, and scent metaphors interlock without contradiction. Minor overwriting in glyph description (“curling indigo,” “jagged sapphire stroke”) borders on ornamental but serves closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm varies naturally to mirror emotional cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of olfactory memory, extinct botany, and grief-as-curation feels inevitable in hindsight. The UV lamp as memory decoder is ingenious yet grounded in her profession. Avoids sentimentality by tethering epiphany to tangible tools and biological loss. Bold risk—making scent visible—heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the concept commits fully to its own logic.</comment>
