<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The gazer’s interiority is vividly embodied—her spatial imagination, unsent letters, and empathetic absorption of others’ grief feel specific and lived-in. Her micro-choices (pressing film to forehead, gathering then releasing letters) reveal a hierarchy of values: witness over possession. The parallel between her and the projectionist deepens motivation without sentimentality. Final renunciation—mailing letters decades late—is earned by prior emotional alignment and carries resonant cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “unused love doesn’t vanish—it incubates” reweights the entire premise, crystallized in the act of releasing letters. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—density builds via sensory echoes (rain, piano keys, sprocket holes), culminating in the marquee’s unprogrammed message as Charged Poise. Cost is legible: she carries grief not to resolve it but to honor its existence. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The vintage projection booth functions as micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: dust, ozone, velvet, and projector mechanics shape tactile choices (finding the hidden compartment). Weather (rain as “hushed thunder”) mirrors internal rhythm and evolves with emotional arc, softening as closure nears. Final image—marquee flickering an unprogrammed line—charges the environment with thematic resonance. Every detail serves pressure or perception, never decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—giving witness to unused love—is signaled early and tightens through protagonist agency: her psychometric act uncovers letters, which she chooses to release rather than hoard. Escalation is textural but decisive: from personal memory (“origami birds”) to inherited grief (“Eleanor, Who Laughs Like Church Bells”), culminating in public release. Cost is felt: she bears emotional weight without resolution, only acknowledgment. Coincidence (finding letters) is grounded in character ability, not convenience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete particulars—film strips, wax seals, cedar boxes—not abstraction. The final image (letters cradled like birds, marquee glitch) offers a non-literal answer: love persists in motion, not silence. Avoids moralizing; instead, the theater “exhales” as walls lighten, implying collective burden lifted by individual witness. Subtext thrives in silence, folded paper, and unmailed ink—never stated, always embodied.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyrically precise yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: emotions mapped as constellations, loneliness “pooling in corners of frames.” Syntax modulates with pressure—longer, flowing sentences during immersion; shorter, rhythmic beats during action (“She rose, knees stiff”). No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Diction stays within gazer’s plausible lexicon—no register drift—even at peak intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is consistent (love as incubating, letters as birds) without muddle. Minor deduction for slight overuse of metaphor in mid-text (“stitch itself into her ribs like a second skeleton”), but no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dull closure. Final paragraph’s rhythm—boots on wet pavement syncing with “forgotten lyrics”—exemplifies propulsion through poetic compression.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms tropes (psychic, forgotten love) through specificity: celluloid as emotional archive, projection booth as reliquary. The synthesis of film preservation and unsent letters feels inevitable yet fresh. Bold risk: a quiet, non-cathartic resolution where love is released, not reciprocated—heightening thematic stakes without gimmickry. Vision coheres across voice, setting, and concept; no derivative echoes.</comment>
