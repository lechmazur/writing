<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The guardian’s motivation is deeply rooted in silent empathy and past trauma (the boy from Bridge Seven), driving precise, costly micro-choices—nudging shutters, angling the mirror—that reveal a hierarchy of values. Her interiority is embodied through ink-stained fingers tracing wood grain and breath-like calm, avoiding diagnostic labels. The drowned woman’s arc functions as secondary pressure, not a crucible, but the single-POV focus remains unbroken and potent. Final renunciation—stepping back into shadow—is earned by prior causality with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate: “cobalt dock after rain,” lone guardian, vanished ferryman. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds via recurring motifs (mirror, shutters, spirals) culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the star piercing the canal unswallowed. Cost is legible in the drowned woman’s gentler sinking and the guardian’s solitary endurance. Closure lands with conceptual repricing: darkness can witness light without consuming it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, rusted awning, iron grates, and rain-slick planks aren’t backdrop—they enable the guardian’s method. The dental mirror and shutters function as micro-settings that constrain action: only their specific properties allow glyph-weaving. Weather (post-rain clarity) and lamplight are tactically exploited. Final image—the single star falling unbroken into water—is charged by the setting’s earlier textures, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guiding the drowned toward witnessed hope—is signaled early and deepens when the drowned woman appears. The guardian’s agency drives escalation: she actively weaves glyphs via shutter manipulation, narrowing the canal’s darkness into readable symbols. Cost is felt in her solitude and the fishermen’s avoidance, crystallizing in the drowned woman’s choice to sink gently—a trade-off between release and recognition. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens with one decisive intensification.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: silence as dialect, light as witness, darkness as audience—not enemy. The mirror’s reuse transforms it from child’s toy to sacred tool, reweighting regret into shimmer. Final image—starlight unswallowed—offers non-literal answer: value persists even in submersion. No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete particulars (constellations on mirror handle, triple spiral glyph), embracing ambiguity without false equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: the guardian notices braille-like wood grain, lamplight’s “mercy,” and shutter whispers. Syntax modulates—long, liquid sentences for stillness; clipped phrases (“left—then right—then left”) during glyph-weaving. POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping. Voice merges lyric precision with tactile restraint, never slipping into exposition or register drift, even at emotional peak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “spiralingly calm as the tide’s whisper” establishes rhythm without overwriting. Figurative language is pattern-taught (sapphires, constellations, glyphs) and pays off in closure. Minor density in high-pressure beat (“shutter-clicks soft as moth wings… ladder of light, door of dawn…”) edges toward overload but doesn’t obscure causality. Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or tactic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms “ferryman” trope into silent female guardian using dental mirror and canal shutters—specific, irreplaceable choices. Emotional truth outweighs novelty: grief as geometry, shame as weight heavier than water. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight; no derivative echoes. Risk-taking (silent protagonist, abstract stakes) heightens thematic coherence without gimmickry, fully committing to its lyrical logic.</comment>
