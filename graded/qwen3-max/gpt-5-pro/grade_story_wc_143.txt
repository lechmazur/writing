<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist’s “purposefully curious” trait manifests in concrete micro-choices—kneeling to breathe through the mask, reciting bolide names—that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead embodying grief and duty through tactile rituals (film, vial, foil pennants). The final act—photographing the unbranded dawn—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the acceptance that silence and memory are all that remain against corporate colonization of the sky.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the final image of film holding “unpurchased sky” reweights the entire premise, asserting that witnessing without ownership is resistance. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pressure builds via sensory density (cinder, cold iron, blue script) until dawn’s arrival forces a crystallized stance. Cost is legible in the stained sand grain left on the rim: a tiny monument that “will outlast no storm,” yet gives the moment weight. Every beat tightens around the central stake—preserving the last unbranded light—and nothing deflates it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The moonlit summit isn’t backdrop but active constraint: pumice anchors the tripod, basalt chips cradle the vial, the crater lake reflects stars only while darkness holds. These micro-settings directly enable or shape key actions—the chemical reaction requires cold stone, the camera needs stable ground, the foil pennants mark absent winds as elegy. The final image charges the setting: the crater “remembers impacts without caring who paid for the light,” making geology the true archive. Sensory specificity (smell of juniper, clink of vial) filters through the inspector’s professional attention without tourist detachment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capturing the last uncommodified dawn—is signaled early and escalates coherently as the consortium’s countdown nears. The protagonist’s agency drives every turn: smuggling a second mission, threading the paper strip, guessing exposure. Cost is unmistakable: the mentor’s message warns of “billboards” teaching “new names for light,” and the inspector pays with irreversible loss—after this shutter press, there is “no second last.” Pressure tightens not through external reversal but through the dawning hush itself, which forces a choice between documentation and surrender.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the blue-scripted message, the branded mirrors, the film that “forgives trembling.” The ending offers a non-literal answer to the central question—how to witness extinction?—by framing the crater itself, scars and all, as proof that “stone remembers impacts without caring who paid for the light.” This reweights prior material: meteors become sacred not because they’re rare, but because they’re free. No moralizing; resonance accrues through the stained sand grain, the tarnished lake, the radio’s hollow congratulations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is singular and perceptually precise: “swallowing the Milky Way like bread,” “logos comb their antlers across the day.” Syntax modulates with pressure—long, lyrical sentences for waiting; short, percussive phrases (“I press the shutter”) for action. POV remains tightly focalized; even backstory (the shepherd’s pine) is anchored in present sensation. The prose breathes like the inspector’s own lungs—rhythmic, restrained, charged with quiet fury—and never slips into exposition or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent (“dawnlit melancholy hangs like smoke”), avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. Sentence openings vary organically; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence (e.g., the single-line “The vial clinks…”). No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks—even under peak stress, the voice remains taut and specific, with high information density: “iron meets ferrocyanide, and blue letters will bloom” conveys chemistry, hope, and elegy in one clause.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of crater inspection, chemical timekeeping, and orbital capitalism feels inevitable in hindsight yet wholly original. Tropes (last photograph, dying mentor) are transformed by grounded detail: real reagents, pumice shoals, foil pennants. The risk—lyric accumulation over causal plot—heightens stakes by making silence the antagonist. Every element coheres into an authentic vision: a future where witnessing is rebellion, and the only monuments are blue-stained grains of sand.</comment>
