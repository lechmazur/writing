<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s “emotionally rational” trait manifests in embodied restraint (“cools it with numbers”) and micro-choices (inviting Tomas to lower the ladder), revealing a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Tomas’s arc—from fear of disruption to communal resolve—feels earned through pressure, not summary. Their dialogue carries distinct idiom: Mara’s precision versus Tomas’s vernacular worry (“blister the town”). The final renunciation of noble lies emerges from consistent interior logic, not epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the pit’s unmasking reweights “noble lies” into theft of breath, crystallized in the calendar-as-reparation. Causal lens holds—Mara’s tracing of vine-to-vine directly enables ledger recovery—and cost is legible in Tomas’s lost innocence (“children will fear the west stair again”) and the town’s shattered peace. Orientation anchors immediately: “disused railway station,” “Mara Dely,” post-petal timeframe. The single tightening—descending the shaft—forecloses ignorance with irreversible consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ivy functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (swallowing the clock, veiling witnesses) and charges closure (“living margin around a reopened page”). Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara’s historian POV: lapis margins mirror ivy, chisel marks align with serifs. Spatial choreography remains coherent—western stair, ticket booth, shaft—and evolves causally (ledgers hauled up alter the bench’s use). The station’s decay isn’t backdrop but active participant, enabling concealment and revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. peace—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Tomas chooses collaboration over complicity. Protagonist agency drives escalation: Mara’s parallel-drawing unlocks the shaft, forcing Tomas’s stance crystallization (“we will build”). Cost is unmistakable: the town’s “polite” stability shatters, replaced by the burden of memory. Under causal lens, each turn narrows options—once the whistle calls neighbors, noble lies cannot be reburied.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ivy-as-truth metaphor that shifts from smothering (“swallowed the station clock”) to sustaining (“hold, a living margin”), avoiding moralizing. The central question—can peace coexist with erased sacrifice?—is answered non-literally via the calendar project, which rejects vengeance for repair. Subtext thrives in silence: neighbors appearing “between veils of ivy” implies collective readiness. Final image reweights prior material—petals, ledgers, whistle—into a system of communal accountability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits distinct perceptual signature: Mara’s historian lens filters everything through archival texture (“gilded initial,” “serifs with chisel marks”). Rhythmic control under pressure shines in the descent (“breath chalking the air, lamps paint the earth with circles”) and avoids filter verbs. Voice modulates from lyrical (“green hush”) to precise (“shift report that lists closed switches”) without register drift. Multi-POV is clean—Tomas’s section break clarifies focal shift—and closure reads under Mara’s dominant lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot or atmosphere (“ivy knows the names it keeps” deepens setting while foreshadowing). Figurative language is pattern-taught (vines/ivy/ledgers) and payoff-integrated (ivy as “living margin”). Syntax varies purposefully: short staccato beats during descent (“They descend... breath chalking”) contrast with flowing descriptions of the letter. Final line (“rescue truth from any pit...”) recharges the opening petal image without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms “historian uncovers truth” trope through specific mechanics: truth as ivy-like growth requiring parallel-drawing, not excavation. Emotional specificity avoids genericity—Mara’s “emotionally rational” stance creates unique tension between feeling and evidence. Bold risk: making the illuminated letter’s marginalia a literal map pays off causally. The synthesis of railway timetables, union strikes, and archival erasure feels inevitable yet fresh, anchored in concrete stakes (Arlen’s erased death).</comment>
