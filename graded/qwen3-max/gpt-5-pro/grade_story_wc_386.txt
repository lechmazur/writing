<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—“ghost whisperer” isn’t a label but a lived vocation shaped by tactile choices (carrying the globe, reading dreams). Contradictory impulses surface in the tension between salvage and surrender, vengeance and truth. The final renunciation—to carry only the name—feels earned through micro-choices like pressing palms to the globe. Leda’s ghost functions as mirror, not foil, deepening the narrator’s moral calibration without diluting agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “Names cross water better than bodies” reweights the entire premise from physical recovery to linguistic rescue. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—dream fragments accrue into a charged poise where truth becomes a raft, not a weapon. Cost is legible in the melted globe, charred rosaries, and the narrator’s forfeited anonymity. Every shard of backstory serves present pressure, with no orientation debt or causal slippage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The glacier shrine isn’t backdrop but crucible—its ice “listens harder,” its candles “bruise the blue,” its seams seal tears. The snow globe evolves from artifact to vessel to mirror, culminating in the etched name that “fights to be seen.” Cold, light, and glass constrain every choice: the narrator navigates by borrowed starlight because the shrine offers no warmth. Final image ties setting to stakes—“windows of connection” bloom in the ice itself.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—salvaging purity from erasure—tightens when the narrator chooses exposure over vengeance. Agency drives escalation: dream analysis yields location, location yields globe, globe yields name. Cost is felt in the “wobbling star” reflection and the weight-turned-direction of the globe. Coincidence never resolves; pressure builds via the narrator’s methodical stitching of fragile truths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the snow globe’s transformation: from escapist trinket to forensic evidence to mnemonic anchor. Subtext thrives in silence—the girl’s unspoken choice of flakes “like forgiveness,” the dockworker’s frost-taste prophecy. Final image reweights all prior material: truth isn’t recovered but carried, like starlight, “cold as kindness.” No moralizing; resonance blooms from concrete particulars—glass, ash, pennies, braids.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is inseparable from vocation—diction blends maritime (“lifeboat,” “buoys”), forensic (“analyzing cameo appearances”), and liturgical (“charred rosaries”). Syntax modulates under pressure: short clauses during revelation (“Leda, scraped by heat”), lyrical flow in reflection. Perceptual signature is consistent—narrator sees connections others miss, filtering world through “windows” literal and metaphorical. No head-hopping; ghost’s presence intensifies focalization without breach.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density without muddle: “candles bruise the blue with honey” fuses color, texture, and sacrality in one stroke. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“borrowed starlight” opens/closes) and payoff-earned. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in dream summaries—baker/porter/dockworker blur momentarily—but rhythm recovers before climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms ghost story tropes via specific synthesis: wreck-diver meets dream-analyst in glacial cathedral. Originality lies in mechanics—truth woven from cameo appearances—and stakes—name as anti-erasure technology. Bold risk: closure hinges on a burned inscription, not spectral vengeance. Vision feels singular, not templated; every image (paper bird, sea bones, buoys) serves the core question: what survives when bodies don’t?</comment>
