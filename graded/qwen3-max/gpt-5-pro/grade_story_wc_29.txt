<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrator’s interiority is vividly embodied—grease-stained charts, breath fogging the mixer—and their cautious hope drives tangible micro-choices (e.g., recruiting allies, patching frequencies). Contradictory impulses (hope vs. wariness) coexist without resolution, and flaws like isolation compound pressure. The final renunciation isn’t naive optimism but earned stasis: “we have learned to breathe together.” No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile detail.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the tricksters recede not by defeat but by the community’s reconfigured attention, paid for in sleepless labor and social risk (“healing is slower than harm”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds via sensory density until the dawn node crystallizes stakes. Cost is legible in the provost’s softened stance and callers “found[ing] their own wrists again.” Orientation anchors firmly by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting functions as micro-setting: the radio booth’s dust, solder, and resonant milk crates directly shape tactics (dampers, labyrinths). The antenna “hums like a spine,” binding environment to body. Final image—sun sliding up the tower as grease is wiped—charges closure with irreplaceable specificity. Every sensory detail serves pressure or theme; no white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving communal coherence against manipulative attention—is signaled early and tightens when the provost threatens shutdown. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing subsonics over silence, recruiting allies, timing the dawn node. Cost is felt in campus fractures and personal exhaustion; power plays aren’t just backdrop but the tricksters’ “habitat,” making resistance costly and necessary.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: listening as leverage, attention as battleground. Final image reweights prior material—the scaffold’s hum becomes a bridge, not a weapon—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gestures (handing headphones to the provost) and charged objects (charts mapping “signal impurities like thieves”). Complexity endures: tricksters return, but collective breath offers fragile resilience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is singularly percussive and lyrical—“voices arrive as a thin frost across the noise floor”—with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure (short pulses during dissonance wave). POV remains tightly focalized; perceptual bias filters all detail (e.g., noticing grease on charts, not campus politics). No head-hopping; even group actions (“we tune couches”) stem from unified intent. Diction stays within tech-poet lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density: “tricksters wearing vacuum for boots” conveys sound, absurdity, and threat in five words. Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors cohere (frost, scaffolds, rivers under floorboards). Sentence variety propels momentum—staccato during crisis, flowing at dawn. Minor deduction for one slightly over-compressed phrase (“dummy out”), but closure remains crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cosmic horror, radio tech, and campus strife feels inevitable yet fresh. Tropes (angels/criminals) are refracted through signal-science poetics. Risk-taking (subsonics as countermeasure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration—breathing together as resistance—is non-obvious yet rooted in every prior beat. Vision coheres: ethereal grit as an ethic.</comment>
