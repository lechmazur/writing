<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aurel’s interiority is richly embodied—ink under nails, hive of second thoughts—and his ethical struggle manifests in micro-choices (apologizing “without poetry,” drafting reversible text). His flaw (unilateral experimentation) directly causes the rupture and resolution, with visible relational cost. Ferro and Miri exert immediate, character-specific pressure; their distinct voices and stances crystallize around shared values. The renunciation of control earns a resonant reconfiguration grounded in prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: storytelling ethics are reweighted from authorial authority to collective consent, with tangible cost (delayed launch, revised rules). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pressure builds via sensory density (moth taps, charred stick) until the vellum becomes a covenant. Orientation is precise by line 3 (“decommissioned radar dome,” post-argument hush), and the single-scene structure tightens around one dominant stake. Final image (“meteor hush”) reconfigures silence from tool to shared sanctuary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome functions as charged micro-setting: its curvature echoes skullcap and auditorium, fossilizing arguments and enabling reflection. Tactile details (char-blackened stick, metal table, barricaded window) constrain choices—Aurel writes on salvaged vellum, brews coffee on a camping stove—and culminate in the final bar scene where flickering light dictates narrative exposure. Weather (rain as “pencil scratches”) and moth percussion modulate tone without cliché. The dome’s spatial choreography remains coherent across returns, anchoring emotional shifts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ethical storytelling—is signaled early and deepens when Aurel realizes he forgot consent. His agency drives escalation: recalling the troupe, drafting participatory rules, yielding narrative control. Cost is unmistakable: lost bravado, delayed premiere, and Ferro’s weary scrutiny (“weighing a coin he was tired of carrying”). The tightening forecloses unilateral authorship, replacing it with audience sovereignty—a trade-off paid in humility and shared labor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: reversed ink, puppet refusals, stick-passing rituals—not abstract moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer to “Who owns stories?” via participatory mechanics that reweight power dynamics without tidy resolution. Subtext thrives in silence, scars on the stick, and soft strikeouts that “leave the bruise legible but not celebrated.” Complexity endures: manipulation is acknowledged as inevitable, but harm mitigation becomes the new ethic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is exquisitely calibrated to Aurel’s calligraphic sensibility—syntax varies like brushstrokes, rhythm breathes with meteor hush. Perceptual signature filters everything through ink, wood grain, and reflected light. Dialogue is sparse but distinct: Miri’s pragmatic “every story manipulates” versus Ferro’s tactile skepticism. No head-hopping; even group moments stay anchored in Aurel’s POV. Compression is purposeful (“footsteps released echoes that seemed to venture out and never return”), teaching the lyric pattern early and paying off in closure’s quietude.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence multitasks (e.g., “half-lit epiphanies... bright enough to navigate by but dim enough to keep you humble” advances theme, character, and atmosphere). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent (meteor hush, hive of second thoughts) and never muddled. Sentence openings vary organically; paragraph cuts heighten rhythm (e.g., single-line “Listen” beat). Final image (“night once more in meteor hush”) recharges the opening without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesizing puppetry, calligraphy, and radar-dome acoustics into a fresh ethics-of-storytelling frame. The “reverse writing” mechanic transforms a familiar trope (authorial control) into participatory ritual. Specificity abounds: citric cleanser in bars, tally-mark scars on the stick, bunraku frames as “sleeping ideas.” Risk-taking (subverting puppet shows in seedy bars) heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable yet surprising.</comment>
