<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist’s trauma is embodied with visceral specificity—rice falling like snow, iron in the mouth—and their renunciation of extraction feels earned through micro-choices (placing the geode, signing as “unwilling to be a weapon”). Contradictory impulses (desire to map vs. refusal to mine) act simultaneously, not abstractly. Liyun functions as grounded pressure without diluting focus. The final endurance (“saving nothing on purpose”) carries visible cost and forecloses institutional compliance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the deliberate choice to lock the coordinates and preserve the pool, crystallizing a stance against exploitation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds through sensory density and spectral mapping until the valley “deepens and clears,” reconfiguring meaning. Cost is legible in the narrator’s breath-as-waterline and the institution’s looming hatred. Every beat tightens around the central conflict without causal slippage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The floating observatory isn’t backdrop—it’s a crucible that constrains action (tethered by cables and guilt) and charges the final image (geode anchored beside viewport). The salt flats below mirror thematic acceptance, while tools like the interferometer and geode function as micro-settings that enable and limit perception. Sensory detail is selective, urgent, and filtered through trauma—steam hoods shiver, decks hum like dragonflies—never decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to harvest unused potential—is signaled early and deepens when the spectral map reveals the valley at the crater rim. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: they choose to stabilize the readout with the geode, then publish coordinates while locking access. Cost is unmistakable—the grant’s disappointment, the board’s demand, ghosts denied rest—and the final trade-off (mercy over miracle) narrows future options under coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the hunt for “might have been” and culminates in the resonant insight that leaving a wound unharvested is a moral act. The geode’s trapped thunder reframes trauma not as resource but witness. No moralizing; instead, the final image of stars accepted “without expectation” reweights the entire premise. Subtext thrives in silence—the locked coordinates, the unasked question, the wet blade of precision balanced with terror.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is singular, lyric, and pressure-modulated—syntax fractures under memory (“the rice falling like snow… the arc, the afterward”) yet remains controlled. Perceptual signature is consistent: the world is felt through vibration, sound, and residue. No head-hopping; Liyun’s presence sharpens but doesn’t fracture POV. Diction stays within the narrator’s lexicon—“perturbation theory” is used as ritual, not jargon—and elision (e.g., wedding blast details) is taught early and paid off in embodied recall.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (“a cracked ear of the earth listening beside my battered one”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (heat seen on road → wavering fields → spectral map) and never muddled. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“topography of ache and almost”) slightly slows momentum, but closure lines (“jury with a thousand blinking eyes”) land with crystalline clarity. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone warfare, quantum observation, and grief transforms tropes into something singular. The “hunt for minima” as ethical resistance feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric abstraction fused with precise instrumentation) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision is cohesive—every element serves the core question: can we honor what was lost without consuming it? No derivative echoes; authenticity radiates from quartz-scars and salt-flat stars.</comment>
