<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The translator’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “lotus-hearted ache,” the coral as mnemonic anchor, and her calibrated silences reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Sifa’s “shrewdly innocent” trait actively shapes tactics: his cast becomes a coded map that the protagonist must interpret without exposing him. Her final choice—to withhold certain truths—forecloses paths with visible cost (risking mistrust) yet enables fragile consensus. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile detail (scarf as padding, tracing grooves) and constrained agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: translation redefined not as bridge but graft, with cost legible in the withheld truths and the auntie’s reverent recognition of the coral’s encoded shore. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through layered inscriptions on the cast, each reweighting stakes until the final image crystallizes shared anxiety into actionable mercy. Anchors (who, where, when) are clear by line 30; no orientation debt. Persistent constraint—the blurred, tide-altered script—shapes every tactical move and the ending’s charged poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium functions as micro-setting: fog and palms establish rhythm (“metronomes”), while spatial choreography (rail, windows, ferns) grounds tension. Crucially, the brain coral and Sifa’s cast constrain choices—they’re handled repeatedly, their textures dictating how meaning is extracted and delivered. The final image (“atrium glows with a strange inland moon”) charges closure by fusing internal calm with external liminality. Sensory detail is selective, urgent, and filtered through the translator’s conflict-zone expertise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—securing Sifa’s safety amid competing claims—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the translator chooses which truths to deliver. Her agency drives escalation: decrypting the cast reweights options, forcing both sides to confront shared fears rather than blame. Cost is unmistakable: she bears the burden of omission (“not every truth heals”), and the constable/uncle/auntie triangle only softens because she withholds incendiary data. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each decoded note deepens moral complexity without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: translation as ethical grafting, not neutral transmission. The coral and cast motifs accrue weight—both are “pocket atlases” encoding stormpaths and safe harbors—and the final redefinition (“graft... drinks from both roots”) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to heal contested wounds. Subtext thrives in what’s unsaid (the withheld translations) and in bent proverbs that let both sides hear “their own mother.” No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the uncle’s “caution and hunger.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is singularly controlled: the translator’s diction blends medical precision (“lattice to hold joy”), oceanic lexicon (“tidepools,” “reefs”), and conflict-zone pragmatism (“consent without lighting new fires”). Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices power dynamics (constable’s stance), linguistic nuance (three-tongued jokes), and material traces (smudged ink as “blue veins”). Syntax modulates with pressure: short clauses during decryption (“I begin... hunting meanings”), lyrical flow in reflection. No head-hopping; all observation filtered through her embodied expertise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or conflict (“fog stitched itself,” “bone to set,” “vowels into reefs”). Figurative language is coherent—oceanic and medical metaphors intertwine without contradiction. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“lotus-hearted ache” borders on ornamental) prevents a 9.5+, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s cadence (“unknot what I can without tearing”) perfectly echoes the opening’s metronomic palms, closing the rhythmic circuit.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality lies in reframing translation as forensic cartography—the cast’s smudged notes aren’t just messages but maps requiring cultural decryption. The brain coral’s dual role (personal talisman and communal cipher) transforms a familiar “object with history” trope into active narrative machinery. Risk-taking heightens stakes: the translator’s omissions could backfire, yet feel inevitable given the setting’s volatility. Vision is cohesive—every element (coral, cast, jetty) synthesizes conflict-zone trauma with Pacific islander epistemologies without exoticism.</comment>
