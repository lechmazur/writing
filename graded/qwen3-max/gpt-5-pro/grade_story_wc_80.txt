<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The surveyor’s stoic sensitivity is embodied through micro-choices—prying stones, sealing notes—that reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. His interior contradiction (measurer vs. dream-archeologist) acts simultaneously in scene, not as summary. Emotion is rendered through tactile specificity (“fingers burn pleasantly,” “algae flutter like patient pennants”) rather than diagnostic labels. The final renunciation—becoming “less man than listening notation”—is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the protagonist endures, foreclosing personal visibility to become part of the city’s memory, with cost legible in “fingers burn pleasantly” and “callused hands.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density increases via recurring motifs (inkwell, notes, absence) culminating in a cadence shift at the end. Orientation is clear by line 3; time, place, and role anchor immediately. The decisive image—“my work glows unseen like coals under river glass”—reconfigures all prior acts into a charged poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: tides dictate timing, fissures channel breath, columns frame absences. Tools (inkwell, nail, tide-chart fibers) and body (stooping, prying, sealing) are woven into action, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and profession-filtered—silt, lime, brass tarnish—not tourist catalog. Algae, mortar, barnacles evolve causally with the protagonist’s interventions, never static.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving interlaced absence against erasure—is signaled early and deepens through the act of writing into wounds. Agency manifests via attention-as-resistance; each note forecloses anonymity with tangible cost (“fingers burn,” “lime and patience”). Pressure tightens as tide drops then returns, forcing rhythmic urgency. The final turn—“I will keep rowing back”—crystallizes stance under coherent environmental pressure, with no coincidence resolving tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: notes in mortar, S.G.’s initials, oranges in sleeves—not abstract declarations. The ending reweights “interlaced absence” from void to fabric through concrete acts, offering a non-literal answer to loss. Subtext thrives in silence (water holding its tongue) and gesture (thumb tracing joins). No moralizing; resonance arises from the inkwell’s lineage and the skiff’s return, inviting reflection without closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is singular, lyric, and perceptually precise—“night... kindles a hushed blaze,” “columns rise like interrupted thoughts”—with rhythm modulating under pressure (shorter clauses during prying, longer during reflection). POV remains tightly focalized; knowledge stays bounded by the surveyor’s senses. Syntax mirrors his profession: measured, patient, yet poetic. No head-hopping, register drift, or filter-verb stacks; even elevated diction feels earned by character lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme without redundancy. Figurative language is coherent (absence as fabric, water as archival reader) and never muddled. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching tidal ebb and flow. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold—each image builds toward the final “coals under river glass” with propulsive clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Transforms familiar tropes (drowned city, archival memory) through hyper-specificity: brass inkwell with S.G., tide-chart fibers, lime-sealed notes. The synthesis of surveyor and archeologist roles feels inevitable yet fresh. Bold risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off with crystalline closure. No derivative echoes; voice, setting, and concept cohere into an authentic, singular vision that avoids safety hedging.</comment>
