<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The newsprint heiress’s interiority is vividly embodied—her contradictions (royalty vs. janitor, devotion to truth vs. inherited power) manifest in micro-choices like declining coffee and placing the pen nib beside the keyboard. Her emotional state degrades credibly under pressure: giddy fear, sharp logic, quiet resolve. Flaws (pride in lineage, inherited complicity) directly drive her confrontation tactics. The final renunciation—choosing institutional integrity over donor appeasement—carries visible cost and forecloses a path of easy prestige.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the protagonist halts publication, drafts a confession, and accepts diminished institutional “shine”—a decisive reconfiguration with conceptual cost (loss of credibility) and social consequence (public correction). The Causal lens holds: each beat follows because/therefore logic (call → climb → demand logs → detect fraud → intervene → confess). Orientation anchors are immediate (“After the journalist calls... observatory above clouds”), and the cost is legible in the final image: “morning will taste slightly of pen and contrition.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The echoing observatory isn’t backdrop—it’s an active crucible. The dome’s acoustics punish evasion (“echoes dislike evasions”), the shutter’s “slow eyelid” frames revelation, and spatial choreography (catwalk technician, primary mirror) enables the climax. The rosewood pen nib functions as micro-setting: its scent (“inked thunder”) and history constrain choice, culminating in its placement as moral lever. Final image ties environment to theme: stars “appear generous” only after truth is restored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. institutional reputation—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the technician attempts log deletion. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her proof-by-contradiction interrogations narrow options until Kline’s shiver and the technician’s surrender crystallize the turning point. Cost is unmistakable: forfeiting donor favor, risking public shame, and enduring the “orbits of regret” widening. The stakes deepen morally—shifting from saving the paper to redeeming the sky’s integrity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: journalism as cosmic stewardship, where truth-telling is both burden and birthright. The final image—stars keeping “counsel” yet appearing “generous” after confession—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: integrity restores grace, even when unacknowledged. Motifs (orbits, printing press, ink) accrue meaning without moralizing; the pen’s “solemn playfulness” embodies the story’s core tension. No thesis is stated; wisdom arises from the heiress’s concrete choice to prioritize hidden truths over triumphant lies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is singular and immersive—a lyrical fusion of journalistic precision and cosmic metaphor (“floor hums like a printing press deciding which stars deserve the front page”). Perceptual signature is consistent: the heiress notices calibration lamps, histograms, and coffee refusals through her dual lens as heir and investigator. Syntax modulates under pressure—long, flowing sentences fracture into terse imperatives (“show me the raw logs”). No head-hopping; focalization remains tightly bound to her knowledge, with diction rooted in her world (no register drift).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances character, conflict, or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“orbits of regret,” “sky as hollow cello”) and payoff-earned. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“histogram wear a top hat, flat and theatrical”) risks slight muddle but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Closure image (“stars keep their counsel”) lands with crystalline clarity, though one mixed metaphor (“bleach real color as surely as gossip bleaches kindness”) triggers a −0.3 coherence penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of journalism and astronomy as twin truth-seeking disciplines, rendered through the heiress’s unique vantage. Tropes (corrupt donor, staged data) are transformed by specific, grounded details: calibration lamps as truth-bleachers, histograms sulking, Jupiter as “billboard.” The “proof by contradiction” method feels inevitable in hindsight, growing from her inherited logic and profession. Bold risk: making institutional ethics feel cosmic without grandiosity. Voice, setting, and moral calculus cohere as an authentic artistic stance.</comment>
