<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The janitor’s interiority is vividly embodied—broken ribs, spiritual curiosity, and vulnerability are rendered through tactile perception and micro-choices (e.g., holding the lantern glass, tracing stars). His motivation—to find strength in vulnerability—is dramatized through consistent action under pressure, not stated. The final renunciation of armor in favor of “soft belly of attention” is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions pulse organically (“ache that opens,” “bruised ribs” learning patience).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Earned Stasis via communal caretaking that forecloses dismantling with tangible cost (salvage crew’s abandoned clipboards, thermoses left behind). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density builds via recurring images (lantern glass, chalk maps) until the drizzle-to-rush intensification crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible in the foreman forgetting the deadline and the station granted “a season.” Orientation is immediate (“mop the night… shooting star tracking station”) and disorientation serves closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting functions as micro-setting: the station’s rails, shutters, and camera plates directly constrain choices (wiping rails “as if asleep,” opening shutters “like a throat”). The yellow lantern glass and chalk maps charge the final image—the traced bird-shape emerges from environmental interaction. Sensory detail is selective (ozone smell, tin cup ping) and filtered through the janitor’s spiritual lens. Weather and cosmic events shape action without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving the station through vulnerable attention—is signaled early and deepens when the salvage crew arrives. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to show the chalk room, pass the glass, open shutters. Cost is unmistakable: his past grief (“ribs once broken”) informs present endurance, and the crew’s shift from efficiency to empathy alters outcomes. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each meteor ping tightens communal resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: vulnerability as strength is embodied in tracing falling stars, not preached. The final image—a “garden of pauses where each spark rooted”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (crew’s clipboards hanging loose) and gesture (passing the lantern glass). Complexity persists: healing isn’t neat (“bruise that remembers healing”), and the station’s survival hinges on shared quiet, not spectacle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is singular, rhythmic, and perceptually specific: cosmic janitor notices “dust… hiding cosmos,” “antennas like patient vertebrae.” Syntax modulates with pressure—long lyrical sentences for reflection, shorter phrases during the meteor rush (“screen flared… sky agreed”). No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Elision is pattern-taught (“mop the night,” “bless the bolts”) and pays off in the resonant ending. Diction stays within plausible lexicon—no register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: most lines multitask (e.g., “chalk lines gather into a river that says, hush” merges action, metaphor, and theme). Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats (“sky wasting itself in sparks”) slightly muddles clarity but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final line (“quietly, enduringly”) perfectly resolves the opening’s “mop the night” motif with earned cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Premise transforms tropes: the “cosmic janitor” reframes caretaking as sacred attention, not labor. Specificity abounds—the tin cup taped to a mast, chalk cartography of surrender—making the universal feel lived. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure, no dialogue-driven conflict) heightens stakes by forcing emotional resonance through image. Vision is cohesive: every element serves the core inquiry into vulnerability as active, communal practice.</comment>
