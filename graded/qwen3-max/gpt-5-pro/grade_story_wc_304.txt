<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her grief, discipline, and love intertwine without sentimentality. Her micro-choices (testing the emerald on the wrist, angling the mirror) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The final renunciation—to send her mother into oblivion with only a captured spark—is earned through consistent traits and prior causality. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in tactile detail like “palms still smelled of the oils she taught me to rub into the knuckles of grief.”</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she renews her duty after capturing the spark, foreclosing personal solace for ritual service. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure intensifies via sensory density and cadence shifts (“the aurora lowered... my mind went still enough”). Cost is legible in the final image: “stand, lucidly watchful, to capture one last spark before oblivion.” Orientation is immediate and functional disorientation (“skyborne grotto under aurora”) pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains and enables: its silence “like velvet,” condensation that “chose not to fall,” and auroral currents shape every action. The emerald chip functions as micro-setting, glowing only on skin, demanding precise placement. Final image is charged by environment: “wind bowed, and the strings of light unloosed and rewove.” Every sensory detail serves pressure or closure; no white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capturing a final spark before oblivion—is signaled early and deepens when her mother arrives. The tightening occurs in the emerald ritual: a single, high-stakes act where failure means total loss. Cost is unmistakable: she must endure her mother’s absence while performing the very rite her mother taught her. Agency drives escalation; coincidence never resolves—only her focus and method yield the filament of blue.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: death work as mirror-making, not decoration. The final image—securing the emerald to the comb so “the spark could travel where honor was braided”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question of how the living recognize their courage. No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete particulars (braid, comb, mud-pulling memory). Complexity remains: the spark is not resurrection but recognition across a border.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is singular, lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature rooted in tactile and auroral awareness (“listening between heartbeats that remained like echoes in water”). Syntax modulates under pressure: short, needle-threading clauses during the emerald ritual contrast with flowing cadences elsewhere. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained. Elision is pattern-taught (“currents whispered through stone”) and paid off in closure’s “static in light.”</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or stakes. Figurative language is coherent (aurora as “patient lungs,” stalactites holding condensation “that chose not to fall”) and never muddled. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“ribbons of green folding and unfolding”) slightly slows propulsion but doesn’t obscure closure. Zero loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis: beautician mortician in an auroral liminal space transforms funeral tropes through specific ritual logic. The emerald chip’s rules feel inevitable in hindsight—glowing only on skin, requiring static-pattern reading. Bold risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision is cohesive: every element serves the premise of “precise farewell” as ethical act.</comment>
