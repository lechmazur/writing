<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied through sensory perception and micro-choices—especially the recharting of the echo, which transforms legacy from burden to active compassion. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. mercy) coexist without resolution until the climactic hum that dissolves trauma into lullaby. The final choice carries visible emotional cost and forecloses a path of inherited silence. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile ritual and acoustic attention.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the corridor closes “like healed skin,” and the wall exhales—a Charged Poise where mercy replaces preservation. Cost is legible in the relinquished ghost-knocking and the grandmother’s unspoken regret. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, with echo density intensifying toward a cadence shift (knocking → lull). Orientation anchors firmly by line 3 (“ivy-veiled passage behind the drowned museum”).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting functions as living archive: tiles etched like topographies, ivy breathing the new map, glaze flakes loosening with sighs. The film negative strip acts as micro-setting, constraining the protagonist’s method and charging the final image (“tucked into my sleeve”). Sensory hierarchy reflects professional urgency—sound over sight, touch over temperature. Environment directly enables the climax: humming through the strip softens walls enough to speak and heal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to preserve or release traumatic echoes—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist confronts her grandmother’s choice. Agency drives escalation: the hum recharts memory, transforming knocking into lull. Cost is unmistakable—the man’s face emerges, then dissolves; the burden becomes marrow, not law. Pressure tightens coherently under Accumulative lens, culminating in a trade-off between archival fidelity and human mercy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the evolving function of echoes—from storage of grief to vessels of release. The final image offers a non-literal answer: maps must comfort as they guide. Legacy is repriced not as inheritance but as attentive listening. No moralizing; resonance accrues through the film strip’s dual role as lens and tuning fork, and the wall’s sigh that loosens glaze like shedding armor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Voice is exquisitely calibrated: syntax mimics echoic reverberation (“Footsteps bloomed where nothing moved”), diction blends cartographic precision with acoustic mysticism. Perceptual signature is consistent—sound as architecture, silence as terrain. No head-hopping; first-person POV remains tightly focalized. Compression is purposeful (“Legacy's burden crackled at the edges”) and paid off in the hum that dissolves montage into tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density without clutter: “half-burned pages slumped like wilted fins” conveys state, metaphor, and emotional weight in one image. Rhythm varies naturally—short clauses for tension (“I whispered”), lyrical flow for revelation. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language remains coherent (echoes as veins, corridors as boats) and never muddles closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Premise fuses climate fiction, acoustic archaeology, and intergenerational trauma into an original mythos where walls dream in damaged cinema. The corridor echo cartographer is irreplaceable—her method, tools, and dilemma feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (humming through film negatives to soften mortar) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision is singular: a world where mapping is an act of sonic mercy after ecological collapse.</comment>
