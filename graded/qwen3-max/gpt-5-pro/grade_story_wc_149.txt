<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—contradictory impulses (love/fear, duty/abandonment) act simultaneously in scene, not summarized. The ghost bride’s “lovingly venomous” presence forces micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: confessing the old leaving, accepting endless tending. Final renunciation (“the debt is paid when you keep paying”) is earned by prior causality and resonates with tragic fidelity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bead’s rhythm names her/himself, triggering grafts to shudder and pears to bruise-glow—options reconfigured, cost felt (eternal tending). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through cameo intrusions, breath edits, and sap-memory until the final naming crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible in “roots negotiated” and “winter-cracked fields” outside vs. inner bloom.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The alchemical greenhouse functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges closure: glass aisles, copper grafts, and flasks are tactilely navigated, not described. The bead’s click against glass cues tree response; frost on a pear announces the bride. Final image—“orchard remembers us”—is inseparable from this pressurized environment where memory blooms despite starless dome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—repaying a transgenerational debt through resonant awakenings—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: tuning flasks, confessing silence, using the bead to mark rhythm. Each escalation (ghost’s teachings, dampening bead on graft scar) narrows options toward inevitable tending. Cost is unmistakable: “you would obey out of love and fear of failing her twice.”</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: memory as sap, oaths as instruments, debt as ledger. The ending reweights the premise non-literally—the bead’s rhythm speaks a shared name, transforming haunting into mutual remembrance. No moralizing; resonance arises from bruise-glow pears and ash lifting like steam, offering quiet redemption through sustained attention rather than resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is singular, lyric, and pressure-modulated: syntax tightens during ghostly intrusions (“no sound, just a bloom of frost”), expands in reflection. Perceptual signature is consistent—sensory details filtered through alchemical gardener’s priorities (sap, grafts, resonance). No head-hopping; elision (e.g., “another name”) is pattern-taught and paid off at closure with shared identity revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“patience is a dry river”). Figurative language is coherent (trees lean “as if the bead were a heart”), never muddled. Minor density in high-pressure beats (e.g., “bruise-glow, like moons taught to remember sunrise”) borders on ornate but serves closure. No loops, scaffolds, or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy, haunting, and horticulture feels inevitable: the bead as oath-turned-instrument, resonant awakenings as confession to wood. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure, ghost as both antagonist and beloved) heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry. Specificity (“tendon-thin cord,” “ash from a wedding torch that never caught”) transforms tropes into irreplaceable narrative logic.</comment>
