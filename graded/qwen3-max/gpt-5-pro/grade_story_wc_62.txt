<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The gravestone carver’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his meditative slowness, inherited discipline, and spectral dialogue with his grandmother shape every micro-choice. Contradictory impulses (precision vs. surrender, solitude vs. communal grief) operate simultaneously without tidy resolution. His final act of loosening the braid is earned through prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. The only near-flaw: secondary townsfolk lack individuation, but they function as a chorus, not crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the stone “receives” rather than proclaims, crystallizing collective grief into a charged poise that forecloses didactic memorialization. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density builds via ribbons, poems, butterflies—culminating in a cadence shift when the braid is unloosed. Cost is legible in the hollows cut into stone and the relaxed faces at supper. Orientation is immediate; causality flows through poetic logic, not plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as micro-setting and active constraint: its fogged panes, creaking ribs, and damp lungs dictate rhythm, mood, and carving technique. Every sensory detail (monarch wings on vents, misting-pipe pauses) filters through the carver’s professional attention and emotional state. The setting culminates in the final image—supper among benches—as both shelter and altar. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains precise even amid lyric density.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—giving form to nameless communal grief—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: tying ribbons, reciting poems, untying the braid. Pressure tightens when the grandmother’s spectral guidance demands vulnerability over control. The decisive turn (“loosen the braid”) narrows options by rejecting monumentality for permeability. Cost is felt in the hollows carved into stone and the quiet endurance required to hold space for others’ losses.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: collective grief is not a monolith but a braid whose strength lies in its gaps. Subtext thrives in silence—the pauses between mist drops, the slackened ribbons, the uncarved hollows. The ending reweights the premise without moralizing: the slab’s receptivity becomes a non-literal answer to how communities mourn. Butterfly migrations and poems serve as resonant particulars, never allegorical shorthand.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Voice is singular and rhythmically controlled: syntax mirrors the carver’s meditative pace, with clauses unfolding like chisel strokes. Perceptual signature is consistent—botanical precision fused with artisanal reverence—and intensifies under pressure without register drift. First-person POV remains stable; spectral mentorship is rendered through embodied sensation (“pressed behind my shoulder”), not exposition. Final paragraph’s moth-like circling of voices pays off the taught pattern without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“thundering calm,” “damp lungs”) and coheres without muddle. Minor flaw: one slightly overwrought phrase (“living syllables that grief hides when it hardens”) risks abstraction, but it’s grounded by the tactile context. Rhythm varies purposefully, with sentence lengths modulating to mirror carving blows and pauses.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesizing gravestone carving, butterfly migration, and spectral mentorship into a fresh ritual of communal mourning. The core premise—grief as braid, not monument—is rendered through specific, irreplaceable details (woven ribbons, fig trees, misting pipes). Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over plot) heightens thematic stakes without sacrificing clarity. Every element feels inevitable in hindsight, yet wholly unexpected on first read.</comment>
