<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rowan’s cracked hands, abandoned blueprint, and whispered dialogue with exit signs reveal a layered interiority rooted in tangible loss. Her micro-choice to return with volunteers emerges credibly from the ghost’s echo-luring, not sentimentality. The ghost’s synesthetic perception informs every action without diagnostic self-awareness. Both characters act from consistent, embodied contradictions—Rowan’s despair versus her gardener’s instinct; the ghost’s passivity versus its active echo-weaving.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Rowan’s Charged Poise crystallizes when she claims the blueprint, foreclosing resignation with visible cost (cracked hands, past tears). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—echoes accumulate until the orchard rearranges, reweighting possibility through sensory cadence shifts. Cost is legible in the tarot coin left behind: some light belongs to places, not people. Orientation anchors by line 3 (“velvet seats,” “ticket window”) and pays off in the dawn crew’s arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The mystic orchard functions as a dynamic micro-setting: pears chime, plums hum sourly at lies, hedges rearrange via memory—all constraining and enabling choice. Lime-taste guides Rowan; brass-hope flavors the air post-revival. The prop shed’s caved roof and cinnamon-bronze blueprint directly charge the final image. Every sensory detail serves pressure or closure, never stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—luring possibility from despair—is signaled early and deepens when Rowan pockets trowels and talks to exit signs. The ghost’s echo-production narrows options: only lime-taste can guide her. Cost is unmistakable in Rowan’s “cracked hands” and abandoned winter of gray budgets. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency—the ghost flips the coin, coaxes tones—and paid off when hammers echo birdsong.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: echoes as seeds, time as thread, courage as cinnamon-bronze scent. The ending reweights “encore” from applause to communal creation—non-literal, resonant, no moralizing. Subtext thrives in objects: the blank tarot side “accepts the day’s light,” implying hope is participatory. Ambiguity lingers (will the nursery succeed?), but the cost of trying is honored.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is synesthetically precise: “hear color, taste footsteps, see the pitch of silence.” Syntax modulates with pressure—longer sentences for orchard lyricism, fragments for dawn’s arrival (“Morning comes with the crew and their coffee”). POV remains tightly focalized; even Rowan’s dialogue (“Please keep the path tomorrow”) reflects her gardener’s pragmatism, not exposition. No head-hopping; elision (ghost’s origin) is pattern-taught and irrelevant to closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “lime turned honey, a promise warming the maze” does thematic, sensory, and plot work. Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors cohere (thread/time, echoes/seeds). Minor overwriting in “fractured timeline pruned into spirals” slightly muddles causality, but clarity at closure remains intact. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with the orchard’s pulse.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Transforms ghost tropes via synesthetic ecology and bureaucratic despair (city ledger’s shrug). The tarot coin’s blank side accepting light is a fresh inflection on hope. Risk-taking—lyric structure, abstract stakes—heightens meaning without gimmickry. Every element feels irreplaceable; removing the orchard or echoes collapses the premise.</comment>
