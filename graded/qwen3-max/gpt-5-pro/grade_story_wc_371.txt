<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrator’s interiority is vividly embodied—“I am a creeping normality noticer, and every scratch on a lintel reports”—and their guilt over passive documentation (“I documented, archived, and sent letters, but never chained myself to anything”) fuels credible micro-choices like uncloaking tools or breaking bread as ritual. The group’s shared flaw—watching subtractions accumulate without resistance—is dramatized through specific confessions that deepen motivation without therapy-speak. Final renunciation (“What I seek is not redemption, but a place where action and attention stay married”) feels earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: vulnerability without guaranteed permanence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tea house is recloaked but the shell path remains, crystallizing their stance—sanctuary must survive discovery. Cost is legible in the dew-revised chalk name and the pocketed shell, symbols of tenuous renewal amid erasure. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with ivy removal, bulb planting, and bread-sharing deepening thematic density rather than causal plot. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3: “secret tea house in an overgrown palace courtyard” establishes setting, season (“after the birds fly south”), and role (“caretaker of thresholds”).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The secret tea house isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains choices (guerrilla gardening to avoid officials) and charges the final image (recloaked walls but visible shell path). Sensory details are purposeful: burlap smelling of “harvest and long walks past brickwork cataloging the quiet losses” ties tool to theme. The body functions as micro-setting—sweeping tatami stirs the past; steam from bread maps vanished streets. Every object (bell, cracked teapot, crocus bulbs) evolves causally with action, avoiding static description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resisting urban erasure by finding sacred in ordinary—is signaled early and tightens when morning threatens officials, forcing strategic recloaking. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing what to leave visible embodies their core conflict between preservation and exposure. Cost is unmistakable in Maro’s herb-selling compromise and Keziah’s widow anecdote, culminating in the group’s admission of complicity. The “heuristically gentle” plan forecloses violent resistance, making their quiet rituals higher-stakes under surveillance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: sacredness persists not through grand acts but compost, crumbs, and chalk names revised by dew. The final image—dew soft-editing the bakery’s name—offers non-literal answer to erasure: memory as collaborative, impermanent ritual. Avoids moralizing; instead, ants fed by planted crumbs and river-scavenged shells reweight loss into reciprocity. Central question (“Is relief allowed when work is unfinished?”) resolves through action: tenuous absolution renewed by sweeping, not declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinctively lyrical yet precise—“ivy that laces the tea house like a sleep mask,” “steam rises like a map of lanes”—with rhythmic control that breathes during ritual actions and tightens at dawn’s threat. First-person plural (“we”) maintains singular perceptual signature; no head-hopping despite three characters. Diction stays within plausible lexicon (“sap and confidence,” “borrowed stones”), avoiding academic drift. Elision is taught early (“creeping normality noticer”) and paid off in closure’s “ability to notice together.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “Snip, lift, thank, return” varies syntax while advancing rhythm. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence multitasks (e.g., “burlap smells like harvest and long walks past brickwork cataloging the quiet losses” conveys scent, history, and theme). Figurative language is coherent—bread’s steam as “map of lanes,” moon making house “inhale”—without mixed metaphors. Final line (“Each season, we will uncloak what matters and let the city relearn its own pulse”) recharges motifs without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms familiar tropes (urban decay, hidden sanctuaries) through hyper-specific rituals: guerrilla gardening with crocus bulbs, mending teapots with sap, planting bread crumbs. The “creeping normality noticer” reframes activism as attentive caretaking, avoiding cliché. Bold risk: prioritizing collective lyricism over individual heroism, yet clarity never falters. Final reconfiguration—sanctuary as recurring practice, not fixed place—feels inevitable given ivy’s cyclical regrowth and seasonal returns.</comment>
