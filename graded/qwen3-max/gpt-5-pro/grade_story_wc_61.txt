<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is richly embodied—grief as pollen, light as something to be shared without fire—and their micro-choices (rebuilding the orrery, teaching transit as kindness) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The stranger’s presence forces a reconfiguration of inherited tradition, not just repetition. Both characters’ contradictions feel organic: the sentimentalist’s ache becomes useful; the pilot’s serenity masks trauma. Their final pledge carries emotional and conceptual weight earned through precise, character-driven decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the garden accepts “reconfigured brightness,” the orrery ticks a lull that “holds,” and trust is planted in the interval between past and future. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—density builds via echo-cartography, sonar pings, and recurring gears until the final image reweights inheritance as transmission. Cost is legible: the stranger’s family gardens burned; the protagonist’s sentimentality was once idle grief. Every story beat tightens around the central question of how to share light gently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The nebula garden isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains and enables: petals fall but never touch ground, vapor terraces shape movement, mineral lattices coax starlight. Tools like the orrery and sonar are extensions of this setting, used tactically. The final image—seeds opening “with cautious mouths” to taste “tempered day”—shows the environment directly responding to human choices. Every sensory detail (helium-breathing flowers, slow lightning domes) serves pressure, perception, and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—sharing light without fire—is signaled early and deepens when the stranger arrives with a scorched gear, forcing a choice between isolation and transmission. The tightening occurs when they rebuild the orrery together: a live option (keeping tradition solitary) is foreclosed. Cost is unmistakable: her people only knew escape; his sentimentality risked irrelevance. Their joint act transforms “transit” from astronomical passage to ethical practice, with visible emotional and cultural price paid in the lagoon of tender darkness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through particulars: light-sharing as anti-violence, inheritance as grafting rather than replication. No moralizing—wisdom arises from coaxing glow from singing-bloom creatures and adjusting twin gears until “numbers become weather.” The final image—moth-whales breaching with non-duplicating scripts—offers a non-literal answer: patterns can evolve without erasing pain. Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and the cloth of starlike moss holding two gears for the next caretaker.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Voice is exquisitely controlled: lyrical but precise, with a perceptual signature that filters cosmos through horticulture (“petals remember winds,” “shadows choose where to sleep”). Syntax modulates with pressure—long, flowing sentences for cultivation; tighter rhythms during the stranger’s arrival. No head-hopping; single POV remains anchored in the gardener’s senses. Even experimental touches (sonar as mapping tool, moth-whales as script-bearers) feel voice-motivated, not decorative.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (echoes as harvestable, light as drinkable) and pays off at closure. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; rhythm varies naturally. Minor deduction only because a few high-pressure beats verge on over-compression (“expression fractures into rain and then reforms”), slightly blurring immediacy—but never obscuring causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>A stunning synthesis: celestial mechanics fused with grief ecology, clockwork orreries grafted onto intergenerational trauma. Tropes (sentimental gardener, burned homeworld) are transformed by specificity—helium-breathing flora, ion-storm-chewed gears, hush-spindles. The core innovation—teaching seedlings to “bear brightness without learning pain”—feels inevitable in hindsight yet wholly fresh. Risk-taking (accumulative structure, abstract stakes made tactile) heightens meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
