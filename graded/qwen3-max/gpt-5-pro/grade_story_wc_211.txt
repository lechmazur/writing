<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The scribe’s interiority is richly embodied—his grief, duty, and self-recognition pulse through tactile details like “willow ink” and “the taste of a coin.” His final choice to inscribe rather than seal the split is earned by prior causality: his handwriting in the grooves, his famine oath, his role as archivist. The contradiction between binding oaths and becoming the knife drives authentic tension. Cost is felt in the renunciation of control and the embrace of exposure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the oath’s purpose shifts from binding to legibility, with the scribe choosing witness over enforcer. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through sensory layers (soot, syrup-lamp, Hittite whispers) until the prophecy reweights everything. Cost is legible in the final act: sacrificing closure for archival integrity. Orientation is immediate (“After the foghorn falls silent...”) and never wavers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard-atop-skyscraper is not backdrop but crucible—the grafted trees constrain choice by holding pledges in bark, and the pear tree’s reply in Hittite forces the climax. Tools (wax shaving, lamp, ink) function as micro-settings that charge every action. The city’s ember-glow and fog-comforter evolve with emotional pressure. Final image—the drying shaving arching night—reconfigures all prior textures into a map of feeling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—archiving emotional truth—tightens when the prophecy implicates the scribe as “the knife,” forcing a trade-off: bind the split (lose echo) or let it open (keep map). This deepening arises from his own agency: immersing the shaving, threading it, pressing it to bark. Cost is unmistakable: he surrenders his identity as neutral scribe to become named witness. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sensory layer intensifies the moral calculus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: oaths as living wood, sound as rind, memory as moth-eaten constellations. The ending offers a non-literal answer—truth survives not through preservation but exposure—and reweights the entire premise. No moralizing; resonance lives in the act of writing beside the split. Complexity abides: binding can betray, keeping can wound, witnessing requires vulnerability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is singular—a lyric, tactile idiom where “sound has a rind” and grief is “pebbles poured from a glove.” Perceptual signature is consistent: professional (oath scribe), haunted (hears dead in fruit), precise (willow ink, glass rim). Syntax modulates with pressure—longer cadences for ritual, shorter breaths at prophecy. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained (only what scribe senses/knows). Elision (e.g., guild, pilgrim stock) is pattern-taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is coherent: moths eat memory, fog is a comforter, voice-rinds grow orchards. Minor density risk in mid-section (“velvet disquiet... mourning gloves... teeth like moths”) slightly slows momentum, but payoff justifies it. Zero loops or scaffolding; final paragraph’s cadence crystallizes the Charged Poise without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise—harvesting vows like fruit—is transformed through specific, irreplaceable choices: skyscraper orchard, wax-shaving phonograph, Hittite dialogue. Emotional truth outweighs novelty: the fear that careful keeping can break a vow feels freshly human. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative mode, dead-language exchange) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision is cohesive—every image serves the core question: what is an oath for?</comment>
