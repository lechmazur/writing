<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The operator’s borrowed-personality trait manifests in embodied cost—his “scratch” after returning traits, the narrator’s felt emptiness when his laugh is taken—and culminates in mutual restoration that feels earned. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion is rendered through tactile metaphors (“column beaded by the rain”) and profession-bound perception. The final exchange of tenderness and laughter demonstrates credible endurance with visible relational reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the shared transposed empathy crystallizes into a plotted emotional function, altering how both characters inhabit their world. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds via star intervals, pronoun palimpsests, and ink-as-force until the final press drop shears senses and reweights longing into relief. Cost is legible in the “scratch” on the operator and the narrator’s shaking hands stilled only through shared vulnerability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The Topaz workshop functions as micro-setting: tools (chase, tympan, sorts) and the halo fragment constrain choices and charge the closure. Sensory detail is selective and profession-filtered—ink smells of “citrus solvents and old promises,” the tympan creaks “like someone swallowing a truth.” The vanishing stars aren’t backdrop but active temporal pressure that tightens tactics, culminating in the shared breath between absences.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—measuring emotion’s strain through transposed empathy—is signaled early and deepens as star vanishings accelerate, forcing the pivotal print of the “third grammar.” Agency is clear: the operator disorients readers deliberately; the narrator chooses apprenticeship to pursue emotional mathematics. Cost is unmistakable—the physical and psychic toll of borrowing selves—and escalates coherently under an Accumulative lens until the final transfer yields measurable relief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the mechanics of letterpress and borrowed identity: empathy becomes calculable only when shared, surplus dissolving deficit. The final theorem avoids moralizing—it’s printed in small caps as observed law, not assertion. Recurring images (halo fragment, vanishing stars, pronouns) accrue meaning without symbolic shouting, and the closing constellation-proof reweights the entire endeavor as both fragile and necessary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is exquisitely controlled: first-person plural (“we”) establishes collective intimacy without head-hopping, and diction merges technical precision (“forme,” “chase,” “sorts”) with poetic abstraction (“lucid turbulence,” “coordinate axes of grief”). Syntax modulates with pressure—long, flowing sentences during reflection; fragmented urgency as stars vanish faster. Every image is filtered through the apprentice’s awe and professional lexicon, creating a perceptual signature that never wavers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density without muddle: each sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Figurative language is consistent (printing = emotional physics) and payoff-driven—the halo fragment’s coolness recalls tides just before it grounds the narrator for the final count. Minor risk in metaphor density is offset by pattern-teaching early (“hush that followed each fainting light”) and closure resonance. No loops, scaffold, or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of typography, astrophysics, and emotional theory feels inevitable in hindsight. The “mathematics of emotion” isn’t gimmick but lived practice, grounded in specific tools and cosmic rhythm. Risk-taking (pronoun palimpsests, transposed empathy as force) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Every element—from citrus-solvent ink to borrowed shrugs—coheres into a singular artistic stance that transforms familiar tropes of connection into something wholly original.</comment>
