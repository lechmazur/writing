<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The albino tracker’s interiority is vividly embodied—salt on the tongue, callused feet remembering drift—and her serene anger pulses as a coiled current that never slips into diagnostic label-speak. Her motivation (to test time’s dilation in crisis) stems from visceral trauma and drives every micro-choice, culminating in the earned act of bracing beneath the falling beam. The final renunciation isn’t rewriting the past but confirming a rule, with visible cost in “hairline flares” along her bones. Contradictory impulses—stubbornness vs. surrender, grief vs. focus—act simultaneously without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: time slows not by physics but collective attention, a rule confirmed through ritual and paid for in bone-deep cost. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds tightly—the wind, ink, drone, and eclipse all layer into a single pressure system that intensifies toward the widened second. Every shard (eclipse aftermath, encampment arrival, ink threshold crossing, scaffold revisitation) is taught early and coheres under the central question. The final image (“steady fire arranged into coals”) reweights the entire premise with undeniable emotional and conceptual stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment isn’t backdrop but active crucible: dunes lean “mid-sigh,” pathways curve to “bend [wind] toward listening,” and tarps frame the elders’ silent authority. Crucially, the body functions as micro-setting—callused feet, salt-tongue, heat-rising ink—all constrain or enable choices. The drone and ink are tactile tools, not props; their mechanics shape the protagonist’s tactics and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy narrows under crisis (ink’s heat, drone’s hum), then widens in the slowed second, mirroring thematic dilation without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—testing whether time’s dilation is real or memory’s lie—is signaled by line three and tightens when the protagonist steps into the ink’s ephemeral corridors. Agency is crystallized through attention itself: she doesn’t alter physics but confirms its social architecture via deliberate focus. The cost is legible in “bones survive with a song of hairline flares”—a physical toll that forecloses easy redemption. Escalation is driven entirely by her choices (priming drone, pouring ink, bracing under beam), with no coincidence resolving pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: time dilates not from trauma alone but from braided attention—a choir holding the note until choice sings back. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete particulars (glinting nails, evaporating ink, opal-eyed drone). The final image reweights the scaffold collapse not as accident but as communal responsibility, with cost embedded in “steady fire” replacing rage. Subtext thrives in silence—the elders speak only instructions—and in the drone’s algebra, which replaces sentiment with incontrovertible data.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is singular, percussive, and saturated with the tracker’s perceptual bias: wind “unspools its long hush,” seconds “burn to live,” terror is a “choir.” Syntax modulates under pressure—longer, lyrical sentences during ritual; clipped, muscular phrases at climax (“The beam still shatters”). No head-hopping; even the elders remain external presences filtered through her chalk-pale gaze. Figurative language is consistent (musical motifs: hum, crescendo, choir) and never drifts into academic register; diction stays rooted in her embodied lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or concept without scaffolding. Figurative language is pattern-taught (wind as composer, time as sinew) and pays off in closure without muddle. Minor density risk in high-pressure beats (e.g., “orchestra of halted crescendos”) is offset by rhythmic control and concrete anchors (splinters like seeds, ink’s heat). No loops, synonym churn, or filter-verb stacks; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence, not exposition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scientific ritual and grief: drone as truth-seeker, ink as metronome, encampment as lab. Tropes (time dilation, albino seer) are transformed through specific, grounded logic—attention vectors, evaporation rates, wind-carved acoustics. The core premise avoids abstraction by tethering metaphysics to tactile process (“taste turbulence,” “count microseconds”). Risk-taking (lyric causality, conceptual repricing) heightens stakes without gimmickry; every element feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
