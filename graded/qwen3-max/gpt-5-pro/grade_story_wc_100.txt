<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The undertaker’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his grief, stubbornness, and professional ethos intertwine without therapy-speak. His micro-choices (hiring the skiff, wedging into the seam) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in giving rest. The final renunciation isn’t tidy; it carries the cost of permanent entanglement with the drowned. His contradiction—wanting to silence signals yet answering their plea—is active, not summarized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Earned Stasis through occupancy that forecloses his old solitude with visible cost (“the city has mine too”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story deepens via sensory density and rhythmic cadence shifts until the underwater library reweights all prior stillness. Every beat tightens pressure toward this crystallization; the “tapping” evolves from haunting to plea to answered code. Cost is legible in the reciprocal address exchange and the lens’s transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting functions as both macro-environment and micro-tool: the underwater library’s coral-ribbed arches and silt-shelves directly enable the resolution, while the broken lens constrains choice by scattering signals until properly placed. Sensory detail is filtered through the undertaker’s trade—salt-stained rags, fingernails on coffin—and evolves causally (water shifts from “heavy” to “chased stillness”). The lighthouse stump’s final image charges closure by echoing the opening’s absence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—giving rest a permanent address—is signaled early and tightens when the lens reveals the drowned’s signals are ricocheting uselessly. The undertaker’s agency drives escalation: his stubbornness compels the descent, and his method of “occupying impossible spaces” alters tactics under pressure. Cost is unmistakable—he trades his solitude for shared address, and the city claims him. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the undertaker’s work: rest requires proper shelving, not just burial. The final image—lens mended into a “softer eye” above the door—offers a non-literal answer: mercy lies in listening so others need not. No moralizing; subtext thrives in gestures (signing ledgers, inventorying teeth). The concept resists binaries—drowned aren’t saved, but housed; grief isn’t cured, but cataloged.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is singularly percussive and tactile—syntax mirrors water’s rhythm (“taps the window, then the floorboards, then my teeth”). Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices what his trade trains him to see (markers, addresses, bone). Elision is pattern-taught (fragmented beats mimic Morse) and paid off in the library’s whispering tides. No head-hopping; first-person interiority stays bounded by his knowledge and lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—every line multitasks (e.g., “sea grows patient and heavy, like an old librarian” fuses setting, tone, and character bias). Figurative language is coherent: glass “crazed as if the sea had tried to write,” plankton making “slow alphabet.” Minor overwriting in peak beats (“blade-thin seam where breath and brine agree”) slightly muddles physics but doesn’t obscure closure. Zero loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Premise transforms tropes: lighthouse = signal failure, library = archive of loss, undertaker = librarian of the drowned. Originality lies in synthesis—distress signals as unread books, rest as cataloging. Risk-taking (underwater library, lens-as-prism) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels inevitable in hindsight: every element (teeth drawers, tide-smoothed rings) deepens the core question of how sorrow is housed.</comment>
