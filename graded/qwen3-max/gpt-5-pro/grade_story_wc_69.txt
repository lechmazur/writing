<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The choir teacher’s interiority is richly embodied—“expectantly resigned,” scarred knuckles, damp coats—and their micro-choices (rotating the rosette, inviting Reza’s truth) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Secondary characters like Reza and the nurse exert immediate, credible pressure rooted in lived trauma, not stereotype. Their dialogue carries distinct idiom (“car backfired… I wanted to swing”) and evolves through shared breath into fragile harmony. The final braiding of voices enacts Earned Stasis: a refusal to let hatred dictate proximity, paid for in vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the rosette’s projected lattice on the wall crystallizes a reconfigured social field where song bridges enmity, with conceptual cost (neighbors still curse; victory is a child’s hum). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds via sensory density (dust, rain, ghostly trains) until breath syncopates into chord. Orientation anchors instantly (“velvet library in autumn”), and every beat tightens around subtraction-as-method. Cost is legible: the mechanic’s flinch, the nurse’s near-turnback, the rosette’s nick marking fear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The velvet library functions as micro-setting: its shelves “hum” when voices braid, its cold turns warm through collective presence, and open windows let song “touch roofs like dew”—environment directly enabling the story’s moral action. The zither rosette, pear wood worn by grandmother’s hands, constrains choice (breath matched to petals) and charges closure (light through its lattice becomes communal pattern). Autumn’s “damp leaves” and rain aren’t backdrop but tactile pressure shaping arrival and release. Spatial choreography remains lucid despite ensemble cast.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—braiding voices to face each other without flinching—is signaled early and deepens when Reza’s trauma erupts (“wanted to swing”). The teacher’s agency drives escalation: rotating the rosette’s nick toward fear forces a trade-off between safety and connection. Cost is unmistakable: the nurse admits she “almost turned back,” Reza carries violence in his lungs. Under Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through subtractive method until harmony becomes tangible bridge “across unlearning hatred.”</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: vanishing arts persist not through preservation but participatory rebeginning (“empty center was where true music began”). Subtext thrives in silence—the boy’s empty headphones, the rosette’s nick—as much as song. The ending offers resonant CR: light through the rosette’s lattice reweights “vanishing” as active transmission, not loss. No moralizing; wisdom arises from twelve-count breaths and scarred knuckles finding pitch together.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Narrator’s perceptual signature is singular: dust carries “traveled stillness,” rests are “moon phases,” chords “braid without knotting.” Syntax modulates with pressure—long lyrical flows for atmosphere, short imperatives (“Close your eyes”) for action. First-person plural (“we sat,” “we breathed”) creates collective intimacy without head-hopping. Diction stays within choir-teacher lexicon (“zither,” “rosette,” “round”) while avoiding jargon; every metaphor serves the accumulative drive toward harmonic convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density: “coats damp with leaves” implies season, movement, and emotional residue in five words. Rhythm varies purposefully—cadences stretch for reflection (“healing arrives not as thunder but as patient subtraction”), contract for tension (“A car backfired this morning”). Zero paraphrase loops; figurative language is coherent (soundhole as compass, breath as lantern). Minor deduction: one slightly overwrought phrase (“ghostly trains and kitchens… folded themselves smaller”) risks purple prose but doesn’t obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms “music heals division” trope through granular specificity: mechanic vs. nurse enmity, pear-wood rosette, subtraction-as-tuning. The “vanishing arts” concept avoids abstraction by grounding in zither craftsmanship and grandmother’s village bells. Bold risk: making silence (subtraction, rests, empty headphones) the engine of connection. Final image—lattice of light as communal score—feels inevitable yet fresh, synthesizing object, method, and theme without gimmickry.</comment>
