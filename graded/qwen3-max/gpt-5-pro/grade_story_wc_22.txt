<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The coachman’s interiority is vividly embodied—his grief, duty, and quiet defiance are rendered through tactile ritual rather than exposition. His micro-choices (offering a pod, speaking dead tongues) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in loss and restoration. The veteran encounter crystallizes his motivation without sentimentality, and the cost—carrying silence, misreading bird calls—is felt in every gesture. Flaws like stubborn ritualism compound meaningfully, never hedged for safety.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the garden signing its name “where the battle wrote noise” reweights war’s legacy into regenerative grammar. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—bird calls, seed pods, dead languages accrue into a syntax of peace. Cost is legible in the coachman’s labor, the veteran’s tears, and the reef’s dissolution into soil. Orientation is immediate (“blooming jetty at twilight”), and the pattern pays off without disorientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The blooming jetty functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: it’s where pods are planted, birds decoded, veterans met. Coral dust becomes fertilizer; hibiscus fenders saint the wheels—environment actively shapes tactics. Sensory detail (pollen, guano ink, husk-breathed vows) is selective, urgent, and filtered through the coachman’s ritualized attention. The final image of wings and oars sharing pace charges the setting with earned resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming battlefield as garden—is signaled early and tightens through the coachman’s deepening reliance on avian guidance and linguistic ritual. Agency is clear: he chooses where to plant based on bird calls, speaks to mud in footprints, offers pods as peace tokens. Cost is unmistakable—the reef’s death, unsung treaties, misread trills that make seedlings sulk. Pressure accumulates texturally but coherently under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: dead reef feeding living shore, Etruscan/Akkadian utterances coaxing sprouts, bullets replaced by mangrove knuckles. No moralizing—peace is not declared but cultivated through grammar, soil, and patient listening. The final image (“garden will sign its name where the battle wrote noise”) offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights violence into vegetal testimony. Complexity endures: war’s rust remains beneath, but roots prove concord.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is singular, rhythmic, and lexically precise—“narrow vastness,” “husk-breathed vows,” “grammar punishes waste.” Syntax modulates with pressure: longer cadences for reflection, clipped phrases for action (“Plant it where you bled”). Perceptual signature is consistent—the coachman notices salt veins, iron, shade through avian transcription. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., treaty details) is taught early and paid off in closure’s submerged concord.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each line multitasks (image + theme + character). Figurative language is coherent: seeds as rosaries, birds writing ledgers, coral as fallen bone. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally (“Tern says iron here, gull says alkaline there”). Minor deduction for slight over-density in mid-section (“Etruscan for smoke...”), but closure beat (“wings and oars sharing a pace”) remains lucid and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ecological grief fused with linguistic ritual and postwar healing via avian cartography. Tropes (dead reef, battlefield garden) are transformed by specificity—Akkadian for floodplain, gull’s “thief’s throat,” seed pods stamped with regimental ciphers. Risk-taking (dead languages as horticultural tool) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels inevitable in hindsight: every element converges on the garden’s silent signature.</comment>
