<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interior contradiction—forgiving skepticism—drives every choice with embodied specificity, from doubting the reed decoy to setting the fox’s bone. Mara’s “shrewd innocence” functions as both foil and catalyst, enabling key turns without flattening into archetype. The father’s grief and the narrator’s past misjudgment crystallize a moral cost that feels earned, not ornamental. Final renunciation of rigid doubt (“I have learned to forgive the map and the myth”) emerges directly from tactile, pressured decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the garden’s logic reweights certainty itself, with the tooth as key and the fox’s healed leg as proof. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image (reeds, sap-map, crescent tooth) layers meaning until the final stair-step descent reconfigures reality. Cost is legible in the father’s weeping kiss and the narrator’s public apology. No causality breaks; even myth obeys internal rules taught early (“the garden listened with a fox's ear”).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The secret garden isn’t backdrop but active agent: ivy-cleft door, sap-glowing bark map, root-stair chamber—all constrain choices and charge closure. The hedge maze’s physicality pressures navigation (“flattened grass,” “hedges kissed and argued”), while the pear tree’s moths and foxgloves modulate sensory hierarchy under stress. Final image of carrying the boy past the reed body ties setting to thematic resolution. Every detail serves pressure or perception, never mere ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring truth to grief—tightens when the tooth unlocks the maze, forcing descent into myth. Protagonist agency drives escalation: measuring the decoy, following grass, pressing bone on fox. Cost is felt in winter’s misjudgment and redeemed only through earned listening. The garden’s rules (“borrowed children when adults forgot how to listen”) create coherent pressure that crystallizes stance without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through bone-setting as metaphor for narrative repair: “bones ask to be believed before they consent to mend.” The crescent tooth reweights “certainty” not as absence of doubt but as space for coexisting truths (“map and myth”). Final line—“making new constellations from the errors that once unmade me”—offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture: Mara tracing tooth on bark, father kissing relic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is exquisitely calibrated: medical precision (“measuring eye,” “crooked foreleg”) fused with folk lyricism (“mud drying in balance,” “leaflight”). Perceptual signature filters all through bonesetter’s hands—thrush wing, fox paw, river reeds. Syntax varies with pressure: short clauses during bone-setting (“press and wait”), flowing cadence in reflection. Zero head-hopping; even Mara’s dialogue (“shrewdly innocent”) stays filtered through narrator’s awe.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density: “woven reeds dressed in a coat” conveys decoy’s artifice in five words. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“cleft in certainty” → “climb down inside it like surgeons”) and payoff-earned. Minor overwriting in “tree-knuckle rafters and leaflight” slightly muddles image, but closure beat (“errors that once unmade me”) remains crystalline. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm breathes with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Transforms changeling myth through occupational specificity: bone-setting as narrative epistemology. Every trope (substitute body, secret garden) is grounded in tactile detail (rush whispers vs. marrow hum, sap-map). Risk-taking—lyric density, myth-as-medicine—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular: “nostalgic innovation” as method, not mood. Final constellation metaphor reconfigures error as creative act, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
