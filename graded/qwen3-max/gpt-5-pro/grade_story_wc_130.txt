<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The conjurer’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—grief manifests through tactile rituals (glass eyes, copper wire) rather than diagnostic labels. His motivation arises from ambiguous loss, yet his micro-choices (humming to stalactites, aligning cracks with constellations) reveal a hierarchy of values: understanding over rescue, pattern over possession. The final renunciation—accepting the unfinished as partner—is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of perpetual uncertainty. No emotional summarizing; every feeling is filtered through mineral radiance and patient pulse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the orchard offers continuity, not resolution, crystallizing the cost of living within unresolved grief. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—density builds via recurring motifs (drip tempo, glass eyes, dovetailing) until the final cadence shift (“silence opens like a gate”). Cost is legible in the chalk-and-salt fruit and the hands learning to rest. Orientation anchors instantly (“After the orchard grows silent beneath the moon...”) and disorientation serves closure via refraction logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The cavern orchard functions as both setting and micro-setting: stalactite drips dictate rhythm, root-black water grounds reflection, and apple-shaped stones loosen only when the emotional calculus shifts. Every sensory detail (velvet box, chipped mosaic, convex silence) constrains or enables action—the glass eyes must be placed on the stone to tune them. The final image is charged by the environment: moonlight framing departure, silence as a gate. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent despite lyric density.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding emotion’s mathematics through absence—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: he chooses to read reflections as equations, hums to provoke stalactite answers, and ultimately speaks the theorem as lullaby. The meaningful tightening occurs when stalactites slow “as if the stone were breathing in,” forcing reconfiguration of method into mercy. Cost is unmistakable: accepting feral equations that “gnaw at boundaries where proof dissolves into ache.” Coincidence never resolves; the apprentice’s appearance stems from ritual precision, not luck.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: love as “a ratio between breath and waiting,” longing as undamped oscillation. The final image—a fruit of chalk and salt—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: emotion’s math is scaffold, not solution. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers (“not proof of life... not proof of death”) yet resonates through concrete artifacts. The apprentice’s added theorem line reweights all prior patterns without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is singular and perceptually specific: the conjurer notices “how a drop hesitates before falling” and reads “reflections like equations.” Syntax modulates under pressure—longer sentences for ritual, fragmented clauses during apparition (“He mouths a theorem... adds a line I never dared”). POV remains tightly controlled; even the apprentice’s figure is filtered through refraction logic. No head-hopping, register drift, or filter-verb stacks; diction stays within the conjurer’s lexicon of mineral radiance and patient pulse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“Eyes that never lived can listen...”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (drip = decimal, emotion = physical law) and pays off in closure. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally (e.g., staccato “I count, I listen” vs. flowing “orchard leans closer as if to grade us”). Minor deduction for one slightly overwrought phrase (“fractioned into tessellations that almost reconcile”), but no artifacts dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesizing mathematics, grief, and taxidermy into a cohesive epistemology—emotion measured by shadows, not weight. The cavern orchard refracts loss through geology, making abstract ache tactile. Risk-taking (lyric structure, conceptual stakes) heightens meaning without gimmickry; the apprentice’s refraction-figure feels inevitable in hindsight. No template echoes; specificity (copper wire tracing chipped triangles) avoids generic mysticism.</comment>
