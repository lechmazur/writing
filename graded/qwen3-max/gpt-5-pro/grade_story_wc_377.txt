<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is embodied through seasonal muteness, tactile tuning, and silent communication—her contradictions (silence as both burden and instrument) drive micro-choices with visible cost. The crowd’s emotional responses serve as externalized stakes without diluting her centrality. Her renunciation of voice aligns with the story’s ethos, making her endurance feel earned. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge via copper leaves, melting ice, and children catching drops.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the aurora thickens, the fragment melts into memory, and the village accepts being “tuned”—a reconfiguration of truth-telling that carries conceptual cost (loss of words, reliance on fragile beauty). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density increasing via bell tones, water channels, and cloud behavior. Every beat tightens around preserving wonder’s hue, culminating in a final image where silence becomes full hearing. Cost is legible in the fragment’s diminishment and Mara’s seasonal muteness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The whispering bluff functions as micro-setting: its wind tunnel (“listening throat”), eye-level clouds, and stone-teased aurora directly constrain Mara’s actions and charge the ending. The iceberg fragment, bells, and reed channels are tactile extensions of place, not backdrop. Sensory hierarchy favors sound and touch over sight, fitting the post-verbal world. Final aurora bowing its head ties environment to thematic closure—setting isn’t described but enacted.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving wonder’s color—is signaled early and deepens when the iceberg sweats, forcing adaptation (basins, reed channels). Mara’s agency drives escalation: she tunes by shadow-tilt, signs for help, integrates water into percussion. Cost is felt in the fragment’s melt (precious loss) and her voice dimming into insistence. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each addition (wind, water, crowd response) reweights truth’s fragility without coincidence resolving tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through kinetic sculpture: truth isn’t spoken but *sounded*, and wonder requires maintenance. The final image—aurora bowed, bells holding color “for as long as hearts needed”—offers non-literal resolution: honesty isn’t perfection but brave beginning. No moralizing; subtext lives in a woman clutching her unnamed child and grief released as posture. Recurring motifs (ice, bells, aurora) accumulate pressure rather than decorate, reweighting “truth” as something that must be continually tuned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature that notices weather as grief-carrier and silence as shawl. Syntax modulates with pressure: short clauses during tuning (“She tuned by touch…”), flowing cadences during symphony. Consistent third-person limited focalization through Mara; no head-hopping despite crowd reactions filtered through her observation. Patterned elision (no dialogue tags, compressed time) is taught early and pays off in the echo-applause—a voice fully its own, never generic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “clouds stitched past at eye level,” “grief he had called posture for twenty winters.” Figurative language is coherent (aurora as drinkable light, ice as starglass) and avoids purple excess. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths mirror breath and bell resonance. Minor deduction for slight overuse of semicolons in mid-section, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift—every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-linguistic society where truth is sonic architecture, wonder has chromatic vulnerability, and muteness is seasonal discipline. Tropes (bell tuner, melting ice) are transformed through specific mechanics (tuning by shadow, water-percussion channels). Bold risk in rejecting dialogue entirely, trusting kinetic sculpture to carry emotional climax. Vision feels singular—no prompt-template residue—and the iceberg’s role as memory-bearer feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
