<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The burned spy’s interiority is vividly embodied—scars, pillbox, fern engraving—and his contradictory impulses (prudent yet daring, seeking courage while fearing its cost) drive micro-choices that feel earned. His moral ambiguity and flawed self-awareness (“late truths scorch”) deepen without therapy-speak. The final act of fixing the radio crystallizes a renunciation of passivity with tangible cost: he must use his burn as tool, not just wound.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the repaired radio symbolizes reconnection to purpose, with conceptual cost in the spy’s irreversible erasure (“the burn that marked you erased your tether”). The causal chain is tight—Mina’s message → bluff meeting → code-writing → radio repair—with each beat narrowing options. Orientation anchors instantly (“zephyr bluff in mist”), and the drive lens (Causal) holds through to the final soldered coil.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting functions as micro-setting: the bluff’s snow-rimed scrub enables the “codes in accumulated snow,” and the pillbox’s fern engraving becomes both map and key. Wind, mist, and thawing drops aren’t backdrop but active constraints—smoothing scars, pressing hush, shaping whispers. The hut’s “gray smudge” and open radio coil tie environment directly to closure, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming agency through unused courage—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist-driven escalation: from writing codes to accepting Mina’s mission. The tightening forecloses retreat (“burn notice erased your tether”) and demands visible price: using his disfigurement as a tool. Pressure coheres under Causal lens, with each choice narrowing paths toward the radio’s repair.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: “fixing what’s broken” isn’t metaphor but literal coil-winding, echoing Mina’s lesson that repair is “a way of walking back into yourself.” The final image—radio speaking—offers non-literal answer: connection persists through broken vessels. No moralizing; resonance accrues via pillbox, fern, static, and burn as interwoven motifs that reweight courage as something used, not hoarded.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is singularly textured—lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure (e.g., short clauses during code-writing). Perceptual signature is consistent: wind “smooths scars,” snow “shivers like sifted salt,” apology is “pocketed.” No head-hopping; even dialogue (“You always were prudently daring”) carries character-specific idiom. Elision (backstory of burn) is taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every line multitasks (e.g., “wind a careful hand smoothing the scars along my jaw that named me a burned spy” fuses setting, character, history). Figurative language is pattern-taught (silver hush, fern veins as letters) and payoff-earned. No loops or scaffold; sentence variety mirrors emotional cadence. Minor deduction for one slightly overwrought phrase (“bruise remembering its color”), but closure remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms spy tropes through emotional specificity: burn notice as existential erasure, courage as unused inventory. The pillbox-as-key and snow-codes feel fresh yet inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric density, compressed backstory) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision coheres—every element serves the core question: can broken things carry promises?</comment>
