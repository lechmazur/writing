<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The servant’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—contradictory impulses (warm curiosity vs. detachment) operate simultaneously, embodied in micro-choices like reading the diary while steadying himself. His love for Madam Vire is limned with precise metaphor (“a bell loves the wind”) and culminates in an Earned Stasis: delivering the relics without intrusion. Flawlessly avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile perception (cold boards, brass goggles). The final renunciation carries visible cost—his restrained heart—and feels inevitable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the protagonist chooses witness over intervention, foreclosing emotional entanglement with palpable cost (“my restrained heart”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds via textual density (ink constellations, frost ferns), not causality—and the spire’s ten-floor climb structures revelation without mechanical ticking. Orientation is immediate (“elevator... icebound spire”), and the diary’s late reveal functions as taught pattern payoff, not contrivance. Final image (letters settling into sleep) crystallizes irreversible release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is micro-setting incarnate: the icebound spire’s elevator constrains every choice (floors as narrative beats), while goggles and notebook function as environmental tools that charge the climax. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—“cables sang,” “hoarfrost corridor”—filtered through the servant’s professional attention. The spire’s “inner ribs” map directly enables the ending, and cold permeates action (“felt the tower’s cold through its boards”). Final chamber’s purpose (“to spill sorrow harmlessly”) reweights all prior atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting Madam Vire from her own grief—is signaled early and deepens when the diary reveals her hidden vulnerability. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to read, interpret, and ultimately obey her unspoken wish (leaving relics in the forgetter room). Cost is unmistakable: his love remains unvoiced, crystallized in “affectionate detachment.” The tightening occurs at floor seven—when he nearly disobeys but chooses witness—narrowing his path to silent service.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: service as weather, grief as navigable terrain. The ending offers a non-literal answer—joy beneath anguish is honored by letting go, not fixing—via the act of leaving goggles and diary to “sleep.” Avoids moralizing; resonance accrues through recurring images (light, frost, breath) that shift meaning (goggles evolve from tool to altar to relic). Subtext thrives in silence: his vow “to turn away” embodies the central paradox of care without possession.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is singularly textured—lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors elevator ascent (short sentences at tension peaks: “Fourth floor, fifth; cables sang”). Perceptual signature is consistent: noticing “brass ribs jointed like insect legs,” interpreting salt-rime as emotional residue. No head-hopping; first-person POV modesty maintained (“I think” qualifies love). Compression is purposeful (diary revelations unfold in glances), and elision (Madam Vire’s off-page presence) heightens thematic weight without confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence multitasks (e.g., “cage creaking like a winter throat” establishes sound, metaphor, and mood). Figurative language is coherent: light motifs (bulb glare, halo, frost ferns) accumulate meaning without muddle. Zero loops or scaffolding; paragraph cuts align with floor markers for visual rhythm. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in peak beats (“constellations, as if the writer believed sentences should be navigated”), but clarity at closure remains pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms familiar tropes (grief relics, encrypted diaries) through hyper-specificity: goggles as “altar stone to her breathing,” sorrow mapped as spire architecture. The synthesis—service as atmospheric labor, love as bell-and-wind—feels inevitable yet fresh. Bold risk: making the climax an act of non-intervention, charged by lyrical restraint. No derivative echoes; every detail (salt-rimed lenses, forgetter room) serves character and theme without ornament.</comment>
