<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lys’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—she cannot lift a throne but can sunder a sentence with lethal precision. Her regal unpretentiousness manifests in action (cupping hovering letters, labeling the signet “seasoning”) rather than declaration. The gardener and historian function as pressure-applying foils without stealing focus, and the pretender’s linen-smooth menace crystallizes status dynamics cleanly. Final renunciation (“I suppose you will keep the dust…”) carries visible cost: his erasure is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ledger stiffens into truth, the pretender’s lacquered history sundered by iron gall ink, and the library itself reorients around authentic lineage. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds through recurring motifs (ink, dust, constellations) until the pause of shifting constellations triggers decisive realignment. Cost is legible in the flaking signet and the pretender’s graceful collapse into vacancy. Every shard coheres under Track B mosaic rules, taught by paragraph two.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ancient temple library isn’t backdrop—it’s an active agent: shelves lean “between breaths,” corridors slide via the rune of drift, and starlight from the clerestory exposes forgery. Micro-setting elements (iron gall ink pellet, mirrored bowls, bark-bound ledger) constrain choices and charge closure—the laurel sighing in relief ties environment to outcome. Sensory hierarchy reflects Lys’s priorities: tannins biting like truth, ink puckering paper, salt measured by tears. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite drifting architecture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unmasking the pretender through textual archaeology—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: Lys arranges meetings across celestial pauses, plants river-names in atlases, and weaponizes cookbook instructions. Pressure tightens when the rune warms to her pulse, enabling corridor-shrugging that reveals the ledger. Cost is unmistakable: the pretender’s borrowed legitimacy flakes like salt, and Lys’s victory is quiet endurance, not triumph. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her cryptic interventions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: truth as corrosive ink, history as editable text, power as linen-smooth erasure. The final image—Lys preserving the signet as “seasoning for future recipes of caution”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: remembrance requires bitter ingredients. No moralizing; complexity endures (the pretender departs without panic, dust “knows your true names better”). Iron gall versus lavender-erasures embodies the central conflict without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is singularly Lys’s: syntax mirrors her meticulous rebellion (“dust moved like thoughtful constellations testing their own patience”), diction blends archaic precision (“folios,” “genealogies”) with visceral tactility (“fingers blue with counterfeit herbals”). Perceptual signature filters everything through textual obsession—constellations argue, letters hover like moths, books cough margins. No head-hopping; even the pretender’s dialogue (“I have improved our story”) reflects Lys’s framing. Rhythmic control peaks during the ledger confrontation, where short clauses (“The line was deliberate”) accelerate tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“He had been revising blood with footnotes”). Figurative language is consistent—ink bites, lies lacquer gloss, smiles fold like linen—and never muddles peak beats. Zero paraphrase loops; syntactic variety avoids monotony (fragments, periodic sentences, em-dash interruptions). Minor deduction for slight over-compression in the historian/gardener intro, but no artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Originality thrives in synthesis: a librarian as revolutionary, ink as weapon, libraries as sentient archives. Tropes (usurper, true heir) are transformed through specificity—royal seeds remembered by a gardener’s hands, salt measured by mirrored tears. Risk-taking (mosaic structure, Accumulative lens) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The rune of drift isn’t magic—it’s a metaphor for historical instability made literal, and the ending feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
