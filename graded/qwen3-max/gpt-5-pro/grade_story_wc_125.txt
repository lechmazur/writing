<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The poet’s interiority is vividly embodied—ash in pockets, ear for “tender static”—and their ethical playfulness directly shapes pivotal choices. The escapee’s trauma feels lived-in, not symbolic, and the tension between memory and release drives credible micro-choices (e.g., braiding rather than surrendering the rope). Final renunciation of the map is earned through consistent character logic: patience as active, not passive. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile perception (“rope curled as if listening”).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the whale mural breathes, the escapee steps forward, and time’s texture becomes “mercifully various.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via layered images (rope, whale, knots) until the final cadence shift (“highways hum again”). Cost is legible: the poet sacrifices navigational certainty but gains deeper attunement. Orientation anchors (“terra-cotta grotto,” “roadside poet”) are clear by line 3 and serve closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The grotto functions as micro-setting: its clay enables the whale mural, its starlit depth pressures choice (“grotto seems to deepen with each syllable”), and cliffs “breathe like shells” to mirror temporal resonance. Rope and whale act as environmental constraints—the rope must be fed through ribs, anchoring the escapee. Final image ties setting to theme: whale watches stars that “answer back,” proving environment charges closure. Sensory detail (terra-cotta, ash, static) is selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering time’s texture—is signaled early and deepens when the energy beings demand the map. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to braid rather than trade or surrender reconfigures options. Cost is unmistakable: loss of the “grammar” risks traveling “blind,” yet the poet accepts this for compassionate ethics. The “impossible choice” crystallizes under pressure without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: time’s texture is not smooth but “various,” revealed via rope knots, fractured calendars, and breath. Final image reweights prior material—the whale now “keeps the pattern” as witness—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (the rope “listening,” stars answering) and avoids binaries; even energy beings have limits (“refused coins, asked for riddles”). Central question—how to hold memory without being broken by it—receives a non-literal, resonant answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is singular: lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control (“highways learn to hum,” “breath like torn silk”) that modulates under pressure. Perceptual signature is consistent—POV notices tension in objects, static in air—and compression (e.g., “second that refuses to pass”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; focalization remains tight even during dialogue. Diction stays within plausible lexicon (“frayed coil,” “starpit”), avoiding register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or conflict. Figurative language is coherent (whale’s spine = “fractured calendar”; rope = “mobile sky of knots”) and avoids muddle. Minor deduction for slight over-density in mid-text (“coaxing a whale from clay… spine a fractured calendar… frayed coil… trailing breath like torn silk”)—four metaphors in three lines risk slowing momentum, though all serve theme. Final paragraph’s rhythm (“rope rides my shoulder… highways hum again”) perfectly closes the sonic arc.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise transforms sci-fi tropes (energy beings) into intimate myth via specificity: beings route messages “through bones of air,” lamps speak but leave questions “sober.” Risk-taking heightens stakes—using rope as temporal compass, trading poems for mercy—without gimmickry. Every element feels inevitable in hindsight: the boy taught to “rhyme hunger into patience” echoes the poet’s own method. Vision is authentically singular: time as tactile, ethical, and layered.</comment>
