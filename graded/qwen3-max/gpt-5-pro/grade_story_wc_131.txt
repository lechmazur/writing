<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The crawl-space dweller’s interiority is embodied, specific, and consistent—emotions arise through tactile memory (copper taste, railing pulse) rather than abstraction. Mara’s raw eyes and steady hands reveal her grief without exposition. Their silent recognition at the end (“you found it”) shows a relationship forged in shared reverence, not dialogue. The final choice—to step into visibility—is earned by prior acts of careful offering, with cost felt in the fragility of the tape fragment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the library steadies its lamps as Mara hears her father’s voice, crystallizing a before/after where loss is acknowledged but not erased. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens via sensory density until the tape fragment reweights silence into speech. Every beat tightens around the central stake: making the invisible seen. Cost is legible in the jagged reel, the silver hair signature, and the narrator’s shy emergence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The library functions as micro-setting: ducts, pipe chases, and atlas cases constrain movement and enable discovery. Emergency blue light, chalky plaster, and brass breath ground the crawl-space dweller’s navigation. Antarctica hides the recorder; the screw resists then yields—spatial choreography is precise. The sapphire hush isn’t backdrop but active pressure, shaping every gesture and timing the city’s flicker against dawn’s arrival.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—visibility for those in need—is signaled early and deepens when the narrator follows a human hum into iron. Agency drives escalation: choosing to retrieve, restore, and place the fragment despite personal invisibility. Cost is visible in the chewed tape, the hidden recorder, and the risk of exposure. The outage tightens time, forcing action before routine returns—pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens with one decisive intensification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through objects and silence: visibility as tender offering, memory as physical residue. The tape fragment reweights “obsolete” into sacred; the silver hair teaches noticing through motion. No moral is stated—the father’s imperfect gentleness and Mara’s listening embody the idea that care persists in archives of dust and brass. The final image—tools set down, waiting—answers the central question: being seen begins with placing a hand where needed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is singular: rhythmic, tactile, and steeped in maintenance-poetics (“knees know the screws,” “breath the brass”). Syntax modulates with pressure—longer cadences in reflection, fragmented urgency during retrieval. No head-hopping; focalization stays tight in the dweller’s sensorium. Elision is taught early (“I make no steps, only routes”) and paid off in the silent emergence—prose as character, never decorative.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“Smell a reagent and know a chemist weeps”). Figurative language is consistent—tactile, archival, metallic—never mixed or purple. No loops or scaffolding; even repeated motifs (“sapphire hush”) evolve in meaning. Final lines (“the hush inside keeps its color”) resonate without overstatement, closing the sonic and emotional arc cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Transforms the “hidden helper” trope through specificity: a maintenance ghost using pipe-chase archaeology to heal archival grief. Original synthesis of sense memory, obsolete tech, and library-as-chapel feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking—lyric density, minimal dialogue, passive protagonist—heightens stakes by making every object sacred. No template echoes; vision is cohesive, bold, and deeply human.</comment>
