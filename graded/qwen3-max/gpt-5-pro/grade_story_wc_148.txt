<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—his inherited trauma, tactile perception of silence, and moral recalibration feel specific and unforced. His micro-choices (pressing the lattice to the door, speaking his path aloud) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in generational mistrust. The final renunciation of alarmism for quiet vigilance is earned through consistent behavior and felt cost: the burden of being believed too easily. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion manifests through sensory filtering (“vinegar tang history wipes on its teeth”) and physical restraint.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the missing are “eaten” not by sea or wolves but by the ease of being believed—a reweighting of the story’s central epistemology with undeniable social cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; pressure escalates via density of hush-chasing until the beam knits voice into light, pausing the hunger. Cost is legible in the alcoves where the absent were “pressed by a promise too easy.” Orientation is immediate (“lighthouse prison off a jagged reef”), and disorientation serves closure by mirroring institutional erasure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison functions as both macro-setting and micro-setting—the lens, confessional lattice, scuffed door, and brined pantry all constrain choices and charge the ending. Copperlight repose evolves from atmospheric detail to active agent that “dresses shoulders like blankets” during resolution. Sensory hierarchy reflects crisis: sound dominates early (hush, whispers), then touch (lattice, stone), then light (beam knitting voice). Every spatial move feels choreographed and consequential, with tide-negotiated parole echoing thematic permeability.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resisting the lazy truth that consumes the vulnerable—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator realizes “truth takes work.” Escalation is driven by agency: he threads his own story into the labyrinth, forcing the hush to pause. Cost is unmistakable: the missing were taken not by violence but by institutional credulity, and his new inheritance demands constant vigilance. The turning glass “faithful as a rumor kept warm” embodies the persistent constraint shaping every tactic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of inherited falsehoods and embodied listening. The final image—breathing bodies found not through alarm but through steady beam and true lattice—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: how do we recover what systems erase? Subtext thrives in silence-as-appetite and scuffs-as-testimony. No moralizing; resonance arises from the copperlight repose dressing survivors’ shoulders, reweighting prior images of confinement with fragile care.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is singular and rhythmically masterful—syntax contracts during tension (“I hesitated no longer; I began to hover in earnest”) and expands in reflection (“chasing hush is not a sprint but a patience…”). Perceptual signature is consistent: noticing hinges on sound, texture, and inherited metaphor (“clockwork salt,” “gulls hover like commas”). Elision is pattern-taught (rumors as paths, hush as subtraction) and paid off in closure. No head-hopping; first-person interiority remains tightly focalized without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is coherent (salt, copper, lattice motifs interlock without contradiction) and peaks are free of overwriting. Minor artifact: slight cadence repetition in “every scuff… every turn… every gull…” but it serves incantatory purpose and pays off in beam-knitting. Final line (“answer with work and quiet, not with wolves”) resolves opening motif with earned simplicity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms the “cry wolf” trope into a meditation on epistemic violence within carceral spaces. Originality lies in making silence predatory and belief lethal—fresh yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over causality) heightens stakes by embodying institutional gaslighting through sensory deprivation. Voice, setting, and concept cohere into an authentic vision where lighthouse optics become tools of truth-recovery, not just warning.</comment>
