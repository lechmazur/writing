<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist’s guilt, grief, and professional duty collide in embodied contradictions: swallowing truth with coffee while grinning for donors, hesitating to call during Luca’s absence. Interiority is precise (“ache that feels like auroral sorrow”), never diagnostic. The final act—speaking the warning—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost (chest heaving “as if a glacier turned inside me”). Luca’s off-page presence exerts crucible pressure through memory and artifact, not exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the narrator reclaims truth-telling, foreclosing silence with tangible cost (curses up the mountain). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via sensory layering (aurora, graphite smudge, rimed vanes) until the oracle’s wind-answer crystallizes action. Cost is legible in the desiccant scale’s feather-weight reading and the taped illustration now bearing an uncovered number. Orientation anchors firmly by line 3; fever’s aftermath grounds time, place, and POV without disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mountain weather station functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: instruments dictate forecasts that close roads, the wool-wrapped oracle hums with outgassed clicks, frost must be weighed. Sensory hierarchy reflects crisis (focus on vanes, smudges, tremors) and profession (anemometers, seismometer). Final image charges closure—the aurora “lifts a curtain… that hurts and heals”—while the station’s resumed “breathing” ties environment to emotional rhythm. Every detail serves pressure or perception; no white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus safety—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator admits withholding avalanche warnings. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to consult the oracle, then to weigh the smudge, then to broadcast the warning. Cost is unmistakable: social backlash (“curses up the mountain”) and reopened grief. The “swallowed truth” isn’t resolved abstractly—it forces a concrete, costly declaration that alters valley lives *now*, not yesterday.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: truth’s weight measured in graphite dust, margins as sites of knowledge (“where the mind refuses but the body knows”). No moralizing—the ending reweights silence as complicity without stating it. Luca’s hidden glide-plane sketch reframes professional ethics as intimate betrayal. Final act—reading instrument names like a roll call—offers non-literal answer: remembrance as accountability, charged by auroral light that both wounds and mends.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is singularly percussive and meteorological: syntax shortens under stress (“I speak without apology”), diction blends technical (“fault-tolerant oracle”) with poetic (“ribs of antennae”). Perceptual signature filters world through fever-heightened senses and meteorologist’s bias (noticing microtremors, pressure flares). Elision is purposeful—Luca’s absence conveyed through botanical illustration, not backstory dump. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked in first-person present with controlled psychic distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“It learned forecasting the way pain learns patience”). Figurative language is coherent—aurora as breath, truth as swallowed object—and avoids purple excess. Zero paraphrase loops; paragraph cuts serve rhythm (e.g., single-line “Now the oracle weighs every microtremor…”). Closure beat (“I do not look away”) avoids scaffold, landing with earned stillness. Minor deduction for one slightly overloaded metaphor (“glacier turned inside me”), but clarity remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality thrives in synthesis: grief processed through meteorological precision, truth quantified by desiccant scale. The oracle isn’t sentient—it’s a jury-rigged cluster that “learns” via data patterns, reflecting human projection onto machines. “Occupying margins” transforms from ecological observation to ethical stance. Risk-taking (lyric density, technical lexicon) heightens stakes without gimmickry. No template echoes; every detail feels lived-in, from mittened thumb smudge to wedding convoy on service road.</comment>
