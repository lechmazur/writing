<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Neris’s interiority is richly embodied—her defunct revolutionary status, poetic inclination, and custodial duty collide in micro-choices like draping mirrors and tilting the shard. Her contradictions (activist turned archivist, skeptic of decadence yet defender of beauty) drive every action without therapy-speak. The final renunciation isn’t of ideals but of cynicism, with visible cost: she risks irrelevance to seed schools. Vark’s presence sharpens her stance without flattening him into caricature.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the Ancients’ “decadence” is reweighted as ethical choreography, transforming salvage rights into pedagogical duty. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through sensory-poetic layering until the shard’s tableaux force a reconfiguration. Cost is legible in the judge’s ruling (“open conservatory, not a quarry”) and Neris’s solitary mirror-draping. Orientation anchors instantly (“baroque asteroid,” “Neris, custodian”), and causality holds via breath-calibration and storm rituals.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid isn’t backdrop but active constraint: nickel cliffs shape vaults, gilt veins dictate spatial logic, and visible time forces storm protocols. The shard functions as micro-setting—its amber wind and harp-wire hum directly enable the verdict. Final image charges setting: asteroid harmonies warm as Neris writes, proving environment responds to ethical attention. Every detail serves pressure or closure; no white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reimagining civilization vs. reducing it to ruin—is signaled by line 3 and tightens when Neris presents the shard. Escalation is protagonist-driven: her calibration ritual deepens conflict, forcing Vark to counter with “worship ruined them.” Cost is unmistakable: the judge initially rejects “longing,” demanding law, raising stakes until the second tableau proves intent. Coincidence (storm arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the victory comes from Neris’s devised breath-rhythm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: time as river to be folded, not hoarded; kneeling as strategy, not submission. The shard’s nursery origin reframes “decadence” as pedagogy, avoiding moralizing. Final lines offer resonant answer: “remorse could become architecture” crystallizes the central question without stating it. Subtext thrives in gestures—covering mirrors, polishing rims—that embody ethics of attention.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is singularly poetic yet precise: “chronology’s eddies,” “walking seconds trailing comet hair” reflect Neris’s revolutionary lyricism. Syntax modulates under pressure—shorter clauses during storm prep, flowing cadences for tableaux. No head-hopping; first-person POV stays tightly focalized. Diction remains within plausible lexicon (“burnished sorrow,” “gilt veins rise like liturgy”) without academic drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or conflict (“cherubs cut into ore” implies labor; “velvet-covered mirrors” enact caution). Figurative language is pattern-taught early (time as bronze rain, seconds as fish) and pays off in closure harmonies. Zero paraphrase loops; rhythm varies naturally. Minor density in high-pressure beats (e.g., tribunal scene) slightly obscures tactical immediacy but doesn’t dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Premise transforms archaeological tropes: relics aren’t loot but pedagogical tools, storms aren’t weather but memory threats. The synthesis—time as visible, tactile medium shaped by civic craft—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over causality) heightens stakes: the shard’s song must convince without dialogue debate. Vision coheres fully; no safety hedging in its commitment to poetics as politics.</comment>
