<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation—to teach dust to tell stories—is embodied through tactile, precise actions (collecting ash, copying lyrics, bowing an E) that reveal her interiority without exposition. Her luminous hands and refusal to cloak the radio during the signal’s faltering demonstrate contradictory impulses: secrecy versus transmission. The final choice—“copied the night’s last line, knowing the hills would carry it farther than any bell”—is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost: she accepts impermanence as conduit. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in phosphor, reed boats, and velvet shawls.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the room becomes a town square “no law could erase,” and Mara’s role shifts from keeper to transmitter. Cost is legible in the patrol winds, searchlights, and boots outside—danger persists even as community forms. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: density increases via layered sensory detail (sea-green arithmetic, brass-ribbon river), culminating in dust figures that wear names “like coats.” The ember alcove anchors orientation by line 1; no disorientation penalty applies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The ember alcove, shortwave dial, and mildew-soft paper function as micro-settings that constrain and enable action: the alcove warms scores like seeds, the dial’s glow salts the mist, the powder remembers fingertips. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite multiple figures (boy, stranger, elders)—all emerge from dust stirred in the shallow dish. Final image (“dust slept as if taught by kindness”) charges the setting with earned calm. Environment directly shapes tactics: cutting lamps, breathing on count, cloaking radio with velvet—all hinge on physical particulars.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reviving story after famine—is signaled early and tightens when the broadcast falters and searchlights threaten. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she unshawls the radio, taps a reply, cuts lamps, teaches seams to listeners. Cost is unmistakable: danger from patrols, vulnerability of open transmission, and the fragility of dust-formed figures. The deepening—from solitary tuning to communal humming—narrows options: silence is no longer tenable. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; coincidence (storm of strings) complicates but doesn’t resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: outlawed scores, burned maps, and dust that learns “the taste of words again.” The final image—Mara copying the night’s last line for the hills to carry—offers a non-literal answer to story famine: transmission over preservation, collective memory over singular authorship. No moralizing; subtext lives in pirate lyrics disguised as lullabies and bruises that “bloom” with luminosity. Recurring images (ember alcove, thistled calm) shift from isolation to shared stillness, reweighting silence as fertile rather than barren.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is a singular perceptual signature: Mara notices “sea-green arithmetic,” consonants “tapping tempos like rain on copper roofs,” and rests that “hinge to a door.” Syntax modulates with pressure—long, lyrical sentences during creation; terse clauses during patrol (“Boots trudged past outside, impatient, then faded”). No head-hopping; focalization stays tightly bound to Mara’s copyist sensibility. Elision is purposeful: pirate announcer’s identity withheld, yet their breath-as-vowels feels inevitable. Prose as character: rhythm mirrors orchestral notation, with rests, measures, and cadences structuring perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density: “the wintered valley wore a thistled calm that felt earned after the story famine” conveys setting, history, and emotional state in one clause. Figurative language is coherent—fog “curled like handwriting,” river “unrolled like a brass ribbon”—with no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in “gullible powder that remembered fingertips” risks sentimentality but pays off in later embodiment. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Final line (“let the songs teach what silence forgot”) resonates without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesizing musical notation, radio static, and dust animation into a cohesive resistance aesthetic. The pirate broadcast isn’t just metaphor—it’s tactical, delivering warnings via reed-ladder notation. Risk-taking (lyric abstraction, accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No template echoes; specificity abounds (“moss-walled ridge above the mill,” “home-brew chords”). The premise—story as recoverable dust—feels inevitable in hindsight, grounded in Mara’s profession and post-famine world. Bold, singular vision with zero hedging.</comment>
