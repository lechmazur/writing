<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tide dancer’s interiority is vividly embodied—brine as exile, soles holding stones—and her contradictory impulses (anchored yet free, defiant yet tender) act simultaneously in scene. Her micro-choices under pressure (offering the poem to the clerk, pressing moonstone to wrist) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The clerk’s transformation feels earned through shared silence and gesture, not exposition. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through action, texture, and tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the harbor “no law can close” reweights the nostalgia ban’s premise with undeniable social cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density builds via recurring images (gaps, stars, tides), culminating in a cadence shift at dawn. Cost is legible in the clerk’s renunciation of certainty and the dancer’s luminous scars. Orientation anchors are clear by line 30; no causality breaks or amnesia.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The twilight garden functions as micro-setting: gravel remembers shoreline, basins pool sky, leaves keep confidences—all constraining and enabling the dance. The body itself becomes setting (“soles hold stones,” “hollow of my wrist”), and the moonstone charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective, urgent, and filtered through the dancer’s tidal perception. Environment directly shapes tactics (dancing where drones won’t look, using starlight to read skin-script).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—remembering without naming—is signaled early and deepens when the clerk arrives. The dancer’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to dance, to inscribe, to offer exile. Cost is unmistakable: brine-swallowing exile, luminous scars, the clerk’s loss of certainty. The tightening occurs in the unmade sentence where authority slips, narrowing options to complicity or continued forgetting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: memory as embodied practice, resistance as quiet inscription. The ending offers a non-literal answer—harbor as shared skin, poem as living paper—reweighting “nostalgia” as active fidelity. No moralizing; resonance accrues through gaps, starlight, and the clerk’s palm as page. Ambiguity lingers (Is this safe? Sustainable?) without confusion, honoring complexity over binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is singular, rhythmic, and perceptually precise—tides whisper “in exile,” stars “refuse to testify.” Syntax modulates with pressure: short orbits during dance, flowing clauses in reflection. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Elision is pattern-taught (“gaps are portals”) and paid off in the heron-like fledge. Diction stays within the dancer’s lexicon—obsidian grace, brine, cabochon—never drifting into abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or conflict. Figurative language is coherent (moonstone “bright as the hush between two waves”) and never muddled. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Minor deduction for slight over-density in mid-section (“syllables where his eyelids blink… lines between dates”), but closure image remains sharp and unblurred.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Premise transforms dystopian cliché through tidal embodiment and poetic insurgency. Every element—elective exile, moonstone script, gap-observation—feels irreplaceable and coheres into a singular vision. Risk-taking (lyric structure, cosmic verse on skin) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh inflection: forgetting as violence, remembering as dance, authority undone by stillness. No template echoes; voice and concept fuse seamlessly.</comment>
