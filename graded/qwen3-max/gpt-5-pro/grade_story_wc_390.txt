<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied (“cold salt on my lips,” “logically emotional”) and their contradictory impulses—duty versus guilt, reason versus ache—act simultaneously during the climax. The Collector’s presence forces a micro-choice (opening the vault) that reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost: confronting personal shame to protect communal healing. Final renunciation (“Take your skiff and go”) is earned through prior causality and carries the weight of shared grief. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through sensory, concrete action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the Lens-Heart remains protected, but both characters undergo irreversible reconfiguration—Collector abandons theft, engineer accepts past failure. Cost is legible in the final image (“key cooling to the temperature of trust”). Orientation is immediate (“drift-ice marina,” “azure-coat lighthouse engineer”), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with cadence and density intensifying toward the sonic chord. Persistent constraint—the artifact’s fragility—shapes every tactic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina isn’t backdrop but active crucible: ice groans, pilings resonate, foghorn silences—all constrain choice and charge closure. The “fleshly ethereal” vault smell merges body and stone, guiding the tuning act. Sunset’s gold “shedding like fish scales” tightens time while reflecting thematic impermanence. Every sensory detail serves pressure or perception; no white-room syndrome, no generic placeholder.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting sonic absolution from commodification—is signaled early and deepens when the Collector demands proof. Protagonist’s agency drives escalation: opening the vault is a high-cost gamble that forces vibrational matching, altering both characters’ trajectories. The tightening forecloses theft as an option and crystallizes moral stance: absolution cannot be sold, only shared through vulnerability. Cost is unmistakable in mutual weeping and abandoned greed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: forgiveness as resonance, not transaction. The Lens-Heart doesn’t erase remorse but aligns it with environment—“adapt to the sorrow without swallowing it.” Final image reweights the premise: trust isn’t warmth but calibrated coolness, earned through shared exposure. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers (Can the harbor truly heal?), yet the non-literal answer—clarity as kindness—resonates without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is singularly textured: maritime lexicon (“pilings,” “skiff”), lyrical compression (“burnished the ice like vellum”), and rhythmic control under pressure (short clauses during tuning). POV remains tightly focalized; even the Collector’s pain is filtered through engineer’s perception. Dialogue is sparse but distinct—Collector’s “cure that sells” vs. engineer’s precise “sonic absolution”—and subtext-rich. No head-hopping; perceptual signature consistent from first line to last.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“brass heartbeat,” “net dried too long in wind”) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“fleshly ethereal, salt sweat and limestone singing”) slightly slows momentum but doesn’t obscure causality. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise transforms familiar tropes (sacred artifact, reluctant guardian) through specific synthesis: sound as moral physics, ice as memory medium. Emotional truth grounds ingenuity—grief literally fractures ice if mistuned. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure, abstract concept made tactile) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet fresh; no derivative echoes, only irreplaceable particulars.</comment>
