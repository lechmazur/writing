<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—ink-stained fingers, withheld love, civic penance—and his contradictory impulses (to speak yet stay silent, to seek reunion yet serve strangers) collide in the spiral installation. His micro-choices—tying letters, accepting the ribbon, inviting public participation—are all rooted in his ghostwriter identity and loss. The final renunciation isn’t of love but of solitude, earned through communal vulnerability. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in lilies, twine, and damp paper.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the reunited couple stand amid a public archive of longing, their silence tied to the twine, the temple watching. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the spiral thickens with each added letter until it becomes a shared cosmology. Cost is legible: years of isolation, unspoken words, the city’s dust-season grief. Every beat flows from rain-soaked arrival to prismatic quiet, with no causality breaks or orientation drift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lotus temple isn’t backdrop—it’s active crucible: its colonnade shelters the spiral, its pond mirrors green light, its “petaled hush” sanctions reunion. The thrush’s nest, ribbon, and lily-scalloped letters are micro-settings that constrain choices (drying letters, anchoring twine). Weather shapes action: the cloudburst swells paper, necessitates drying, triggers emotional exposure. Final image—the nest-centered cosmos—is charged by every prior environmental detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rejoining lost love through public art—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: he builds the spiral, invites strangers, transforms private grief into communal ritual. Pressure tightens when the woman appears; the crowd parts, the ribbon thrums, and the spiral becomes the only path. Cost is felt: years of self-exile, ink-stained secrecy, the risk of public rejection. Coincidence (her arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve—he’s built the road she walks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme—secrets as connective tissue—emerges through action: ghostwriting, nest-building, letter-tying. The final image reweights everything: “These words belong to no one and to everyone” crystallizes the idea that intimacy thrives in shared vulnerability, not private possession. No moralizing; resonance blooms from crimson ribbon, fluttering pages, and warm stone. Ambiguity lingers—will they stay?—but the thematic answer is clear: connection requires public light.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is exquisitely calibrated: lyrical yet precise, haunted yet tender. Syntax mirrors emotional rhythm—long, fluid sentences for reflection; short, anchored phrases for action (“I cup it,” “She did not smile”). Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices geometry in nests, salt in tears, constellations in ink. No head-hopping; even crowd members are filtered through his gaze. Diction stays within ghostwriter lexicon—no register drift, no artificiality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“prismatic quiet,” “words wanting to rejoin mouths”) and pays off in the final cosmos image. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. One minor density risk—“constellations of sincerity” slightly abstract—but immediately grounded by “thread that connects all things.” Closure image remains lucid despite lyricism.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ghostwriting as sacred civic duty, public art as reunion ritual. Tropes (lost love, temple setting) are transformed by specificity—dragonflies stitching pond edges, tea-paid monks, dust-season departure. Risk-taking (accumulative structure, no dialogue-driven climax) heightens stakes: reunion occurs through collective witness, not private plea. Vision feels singular—urban mysticism rooted in ink, nests, and lilies—not prompt-derived.</comment>
