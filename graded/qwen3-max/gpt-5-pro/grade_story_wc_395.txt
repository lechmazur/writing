<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—“brightly attentive,” morally conflicted, and professionally constrained—and her micro-choices (lying to access the vault, choosing not to leak evidence) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Her motivation to recover deletion’s truth grows organically from character-specific obsession rather than plot convenience. The final renunciation (“do the smallest impossible thing”) is earned through prior causality and registers as Earned Stasis with emotional and institutional stakes. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest through tactile detail (“fabric smells like dry rain”) and ethical tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “disappearance is a system, not a drama” reweights the entire premise, revealing systemic erasure over individual tragedy. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—numbers, patch, deletions accrue meaning until the final image crystallizes their charge. Cost is legible in the protagonist’s quiet endurance and forfeited justice (“leave the numbers to work”). Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3 (“corporate memory keeper… social network archive”), and the Sargasso descent functions as taught pattern, not disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The archive setting operates as both environment and tool: anaerobic layers, rack rows, candlelight permissions—all constrain choice and shape tactics. The patch functions as micro-setting, its broken stitches mapping to missing drives and enabling discovery. Final image (“bus ad flashes 1103”) charges closure by embedding the system’s persistence into public space. Sensory specificity (“blue like tide,” “dry rain”) filters through POV bias without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus managed forgetting—is signaled early and deepens when Lia’s deletions expose corporate complicity. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her lie unlocks the vault, her interpretation of the patch retrieves the ledger, her refusal to export preserves integrity at personal cost. The tightening forecloses legal recourse but opens moral resonance; price is visible in her isolation and the weight of complicity (“lie is heavier now”). Coincidence (bus ad) complicates but doesn’t resolve—it echoes systemic recurrence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of deletion, memory, and institutional silence—never stated outright. The patch’s broken stitches and recurring numbers accrue subtext about hidden accountability. Final image offers non-literal answer: justice persists as ambient signal, not headline. Resists moralizing; embraces ambiguity (“not recovered, but not entirely missing”) while condemning systemic erasure without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is singular, lyrical yet precise—“timelines, damper racks, and the banked cinders of public grief”—with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure (shorter clauses during descent). Perceptual signature is consistent: notices metadata ghosts, file topologies, blue embroidery. No head-hopping; first-person interiority stays bounded. Elision (“deletion was dispersion, a tidy myth”) is taught early and paid off in Sargasso revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language (“playlist dissolve yet their ghosts hum,” “sensed absence sitting beside that feed”) is coherent and purposeful. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts serve cadence (“I descend…” / “There the numbers return…”). Final line (“for one night that feels like mercy”) resolves with resonant simplicity, recharging earlier motifs without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise transforms familiar tropes (digital archivist, cold case) through specific world logic: deletion as quarantine, metadata as ghost topology. The synthesis of corporate bureaucracy, orbital disaster, and archival poetics feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over causality) heightens thematic stakes without sacrificing clarity. Vision is cohesive—every element serves the central inquiry into systemic disappearance.</comment>
