<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrator’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—contradictory impulses (to stay/leave, speak/withhold) manifest through tactile micro-choices (turning the cicada, watching the snail). Their “tidal-pool chronicler” identity shapes perception and action without diagnostic self-awareness. The final renunciation (“I do not choose tonight”) feels earned by accumulated pressure and prior character logic, with visible relational cost in the hitched breath and eased shoulders.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): options crystallize without decision, yet the cost of ambiguity is felt (“risk the shore breaking”). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via recurring thresholds (molting crab, foam sentences) until the cicada’s reweighted meaning reconfigures “leaving” as “arrival.” Cost is legible in the tide’s “cool vow” and unspooled trust; no causality breaks or orientation drift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The grotto functions as micro-setting: barnacles, tidal pools, and stone migrations constrain perception and enable the narrator’s tangential approach. Sensory detail (drip/hush, cool jade, salt on tongues) is selective, urgent, and filtered through the chronicler’s bias. The scallop-edge texture of time charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate by constraining choice (foregoing direct answer) and shaping closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to stay or leave—is signaled early and deepens via the cicada’s symbolism and shared history. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: cataloging thresholds, invoking mussel logic, reframing departure. The tightening (“cross this mouth of water… until footing names itself”) forecloses immediate resolution but affirms joint navigation, with emotional cost in exposed vulnerability (“fear my answer would spring like a trap”).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: tidal rhythms, molting, and cicada fossils reframe transition as sacred liminality. The ending offers a non-literal answer—“leaving is a form of arrival”—that reweights all prior images without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (“useful, like salt on a cut”) and objects; ambiguity lingers (will they stay?) but complexity feels earned, not evasive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is a masterclass in perceptual signature: syntax mimics tidal cadence (long sentences ebbing into fragments), diction blends scientific precision (“respiring sand”) with poetic tactility (“pocket shrine for transition”). POV remains tightly focalized; even “we” moments center the narrator’s sensorium. Elision (unstated answer) is taught early (“never by staring straight”) and pays off in the dissolved “difficult part.”</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density: each image pulls thematic, atmospheric, and character weight (“jade body a promise that leaving is a form of arrival”). Rhythm varies purposefully—breathy clauses during tension, lyrical flow in reflection. Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors cohere within tidal logic. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in “catalog of thresholds,” but closure remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms coastal liminality tropes through hyper-specificity: the chronicler’s methodology, cicada as archaeological token, and “slack nets” pedagogy feel freshly minted. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure, deferred climax) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The synthesis of tidal ecology and human indecision feels inevitable in hindsight, with irreplaceable details (barnacle-light, scallop-edge time).</comment>
