<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist’s trauma is embodied with visceral specificity—“wrists try to twist apart,” “shiver write the date on my bones”—avoiding diagnostic abstraction. Contradictory impulses (seeking mercy while fearing recurrence of violence) act simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation—leaving the mask strap behind—is earned by prior calibration of pain and proprioception, with visible cost in enduring rather than resolving trauma.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the protagonist refuses to carry the instrument of torture forward, marking a boundary condition that forecloses re-victimization. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the forest’s liturgical maze deepens via sensory recursion until the pool offers Charged Poise. Cost is legible in the face “that survived because it learned to impersonate stone.” Orientation is functional disorientation taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest functions as both setting and micro-setting: pollen hums, light bruises, corridors shift—all constraining navigation and memory retrieval. The pewter strap and still pool directly charge the final image, where reflection becomes equation. Sensory hierarchy narrows under stress (iron taste, thrown-cloth smell), then expands in calmer beats, all filtered through a traumatized proprioceptive lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering the mathematics of mercy—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist realizes mercy requires relinquishing power, not solving equations. Agency manifests through renunciation (not tightening the strap) and backward walking as proof-testing. Cost is unmistakable: survival demands impersonating stone, and the hand that held them underwater retains phantom claim until the final step toward survivable ordinariness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the interplay of torture residue and mathematical yearning—mercy as a limit function, not an outcome. The final equation (“intention weighted by injury… divided by power relinquished”) avoids moralizing by grounding abstraction in bodily experience. The mask strap’s recursion reweights earlier trauma: return is not repetition but recalibration. No tidy resolution; ambiguity lingers in whether the stars-as-names lie was permitted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is singularly calibrated to a proprioceptively enhanced trauma survivor: syntax contracts under spasm (“I freeze, then I let the shiver write…”), expands in reflection. Perceptual signature is consistent—measuring breath in tendon distances, light as bruised hum. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained (no omniscience). Elision (e.g., unnamed interrogators) is purposeful and paid off via the mask’s etched numbers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density: “pollen that drinks whatever light is left… returns it as bruised humming” merges setting, sensation, and metaphor without muddle. Rhythm varies—staccato during spasms, fluid in equations. Minor overwriting in “liturgical maze” risks abstraction but is grounded by immediate tactile detail (moss, pewter). No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Transforms interrogation tropes through mathematical lyricism and proprioceptive embodiment. The synthesis of torture archive, ultraviolet penance, and mercy-as-limit feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking (equations as prayers, backward walking as proof) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision is cohesive: voice, concept, and closure fuse into an artistic stance that resists redemption arcs for rigor.</comment>
