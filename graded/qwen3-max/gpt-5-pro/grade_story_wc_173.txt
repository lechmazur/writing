<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation—defiance through abstinent craft—is embodied in every micro-choice, from barefoot steps to unbraiding the city’s lullaby. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest as frost-stamped syllables and breath-as-metronome. The final renunciation (empty hands, no fire) earns Charged Poise with visible cost: her chaste body remains, but her purpose widens. Contradictory impulses—refusal as weapon, silence as generosity—act simultaneously without resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the door opens not by force but by unbraiding obedience, refracting echoes into self-possession. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via ribbons of breath, snow-arteries, prismatic seams—and culminates in a city that “breathed with her.” Cost is legible in the guild’s impotence and Lira’s enduring chastity. Every beat tightens the central stake: conformity vs. resonant selfhood.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The silver courtyard under snow functions as micro-setting: its frost records vows, its breath-balanced door demands precise timing, and its snowlight becomes prismatic seams at climax. Body (bare feet), object (ribbons), and environment co-constrain tactics—Lira must untangle threads *here*, *now*, or fail. Final image charges the setting: snow writes a new path, transforming passive hush into active holding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defying the lullaby of conformity—is signaled early and escalates through Lira’s agency: she chooses which ribbon to untangle, which knot to tease. Each deepening (father’s false laugh, soldier’s silent hunger) narrows options until only the city’s great braid remains. Cost is unmistakable: her art risks irrelevance if she fails, and success burns softly in her hands. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: silence as space-making, not emptiness. The prism sanctuary’s refracted grief reweights prior material—obedience is unbraided, not destroyed—and the final image (“doors remembered how to open without permission”) answers the central question non-literally. No moralizing; resonance arises from ribbons returned as light and soldiers asking for bread “without shame.” Complexity endures: peace is redefined, not rejected.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrically precise yet controlled: “bodily poetic” syntax mirrors Lira’s restraint (“steps were syllables stamped into frost”). Perceptual signature filters all detail through her chaste, echo-harvesting gaze. No head-hopping; compression (e.g., “mothers kept the lullabies and loosened the obedience”) is pattern-taught and closure-paid. Rhythm modulates—from metronomic breath to prismatic fish-schools—without losing coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density: “snow spun in patient spirals” conveys time, mood, and pressure. Figurative language is coherent (ribbons of breath, arteries under ice) and never muddles causality. Minor overwriting in “prism sanctuary” description slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops or scaffold mar peak beats. Final line (“doors remembered how to open without permission”) masterfully recharges the opening’s “alarming serenity.”</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms courtesan tropes: chastity as active resistance, not purity. The “harvest of echoes” premise feels inevitable in hindsight—guild commodifies grief, Lira liberates it via textile logic (unbraiding). Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure, conceptual stakes) heightens meaning without gimmickry. Vision coheres: every image serves the thesis that true peace requires unbinding, not silence.</comment>
