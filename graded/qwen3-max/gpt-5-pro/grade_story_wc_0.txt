<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—salt and metal on hands, tactile attention to dust maps—and their scientific worldview shapes every micro-choice. Motivation (“strip needless drama”) conflicts credibly with emotional loss (the botanist’s notebooks), yielding decisions that foreclose heroic gestures in favor of pragmatic triage. The final renunciation of spectacle for slope-work feels earned through consistent characterization. Minor deduction: the botanist’s arrival lacks friction, slightly softening the cost of endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the greenhouse becomes “a star made humble,” reconfiguring decay as contribution. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—dust patterns, wing residue, brine-drunk orchids accrue into a legible map—and the cost (lost notebooks, dead plants, deferred restoration) is visible in every taped crack. Orientation is immediate (“After the flood...”), and the single scene deepens without slack. No causality breaks; every image feeds the final calibration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The storm-damaged greenhouse functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains choice: bowed frames dictate pane replacement, silt-covered benches limit salvageable trays, and fractured glass channels ventilation tactics. Sensory detail is filtered through the researcher’s dual lens—scientific precision (“forensic meteorology”) and grief (“her pages... weighing each sheet with a stone”). The recurring dust maps evolve from forensic trace to teaching tool, charging the final image where children “steer by windows.” Deduct 0.1 for slight overreliance on visual texture at the expense of other senses in peak beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rebuilding with integrity amid loss—is signaled early and tightens through the protagonist’s agency: choosing which orchids to save, which panes to replace, rejecting motors for hand fans. The meaningful deepening occurs when decay shifts from enemy to “partner,” altering tactics (composting the dead to feed survivors). Cost is unmistakable: drowned notebooks, brine-killed blooms, half-light reopening. Escalation adheres to the Accumulative lens—pressure builds via layered debris (physical and emotional), not external antagonism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the neutron star/orchid parallel: dignified decay as generative force. Subtext thrives in concrete particulars—the butterfly dust mapping wind, pulsar patience mirrored in lichen-like repair—never moralizing. The ending reweights the premise: “gradual change wins” isn’t stated but shown through children reading dust maps and tape-refined plans. Final image (“star made humble”) offers a non-literal answer to the central question—how to honor loss without grandeur—through earned resonance, not assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is exquisitely calibrated—a scientist’s precision (“preprocesses reality into gradients”) fused with poetic compression (“riverbeds left in the air”). Perceptual signature is consistent: noticing fracture lines like data streams, decay as rhythmic as pulsar spin. Syntax modulates under pressure—longer cadences for reflection, clipped phrases for action (“I mark... I number... I save”). No head-hopping; even the botanist’s presence is filtered through the narrator’s lens. Prose as character: every sentence embodies the mind of someone who sees patterns in ruin.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each line multitasks (e.g., “orchids hold their breath” conveys state, stakes, and atmosphere). Figurative language is pattern-taught (stars/greenhouse, decay/maps) and never muddled. Minor artifact: two adjacent sentences near the start (“I came for measurement... That habit of mind...”) slightly paraphrase the anti-drama motive, costing 0.3. Otherwise, rhythm varies purposefully, paragraph cuts serve emotional beats, and closure image (“dust lifts and resettles”) crystallizes the theme without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Ingenuity lies in synthesizing astrophysics and horticulture into a cohesive metaphor system where neither feels ornamental. The neutron star researcher’s methodology directly informs greenhouse triage—uncommon and specific. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over plot) heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passed: swapping professions would collapse the story’s logic. Bold yet precise—decay as “giving back,” dust as cartography—feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
