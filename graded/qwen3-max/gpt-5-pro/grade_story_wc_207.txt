<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—fingertips scanning for echoes, calves registering heat as memory—and their “sensibly eccentric” restraint (knotting a cord before entering) reveals a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. caution) act simultaneously without therapy-speak. The final vow (“I will return with what must be kept”) earns the renunciation through consistent motive and micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the compass needle becomes a hinge pin, the seam breathes open, and the explorers’ transformation into “librarians of pressure and time” reweights reality itself. Cost is legible in the empty case left behind and the footprints’ “shine of understanding.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first petrichor to final vial, with each sensory layer deepening stakes toward an undeniable before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Limestone cliffs, rusted trestle, and subterranean lagoon aren’t backdrop but active constraints—the conveyor “points at the waves,” the cleft “breathes cold,” the seam “offends geology.” The compass and vials function as micro-settings that directly enable key choices. Final image of the “empty case” charged by the cave’s absence proves environment shapes closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding where explanations fail—is signaled early and tightens when the compass insists left, forcing tactile psychometry over reason. Agency drives escalation: humming opens the seam, pressing the needle admits entry. Cost is felt in the explorers’ absorbed silence and the narrator’s returned emptiness, though the factory’s shutdown exerts passive rather than active pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through hinged awakenings as doors “disguised as choices,” rejecting language for “breath before language.” The final vial of paradoxical petrichor (“dust there drinks nothing and still breathes rain”) offers non-literal resolution: knowledge as listening, not naming. No moralizing; resonance accrues via limestone veins holding explorer-shadows as “archivists of hush.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exquisitely controlled—petrichor as “skin of earth speaking itself,” hush as “poured into every bolt.” Syntax modulates with pressure: short clauses during compass quivers (“Rain begins, fine as gauze”), lyrical flow in revelation. First-person remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping. Voice never slips into exposition or diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “salt-silvered films quiver,” “iron stains stripe the rock like old scores.” Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances atmosphere or action. One minor risk: “resonant hush” repeats, but functions as leitmotif rather than redundancy. Final line (“returning with a vial and an empty case”) crystallizes theme without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms tropes (lost expeditions, hidden caves) through specific synthesis: psychometry as method, petrichor as archive, hinges as epistemology. The compass unsticking from north to serve stone logic feels inevitable yet fresh. Bold risk in making silence (“widening” not fear) the explorers’ legacy—elevates stakes without gimmickry. Vision coheres as singular artistic stance.</comment>
