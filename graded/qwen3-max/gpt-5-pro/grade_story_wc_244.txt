<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation—to cure loneliness through logistics—is embodied in every micro-choice, from trading batteries for truth to writing “friends” in the ledger. Her “desperately jocular” humor isn’t labeled but enacted: the grin “sent ahead to catch a falling person” reveals her emotional strategy under pressure. Internal contradiction thrums—she seeks connection yet remains elusive, felt “only by their needs,” which she accepts as “close enough to love.” The final renunciation (leaving the moon rock) is earned by prior reciprocity and carries visible cost: her rest is partial because loneliness “still prowled.”</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “crisis has become community without anyone asking permission” reweights the entire premise, with cost legible in Mara’s partial solitude and the camp’s fragile hammock of promises. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—rumor chains, ivy, radios, and the ledger accrue meaning until the moon rock catalyzes communal listening. Every beat tightens around reciprocity; the surveyor’s confession → shared ledger → counter queue forms a causal arc within the accumulative frame. Cost is crystallized in the final image: Mara rests “sometimes,” not fully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The disused station functions as micro-setting: ivy “tests its patience” with the moon rock, tracks spared by flood anchor spatial logic, and the ticket counter becomes altar for confessions. Sensory detail is purposeful—“cold breath” of rumor, “gray shard… like a whisper adjusting its coat”—filtered through Mara’s logistical-poetic perception. The ivy, radios, and thermoses aren’t backdrop but tools that constrain choice (e.g., spare wire enables trust). Final image ties ivy’s “slow green breath” to communal patience, charging closure with environmental resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—curing loneliness through attention-as-logistics—is signaled early and deepens when the moon rock shifts from object to social catalyst. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she follows rumor, negotiates with surveyor, plants a new rumor (“speak to this rock…”), and steps back to let community form. Cost is unmistakable: her “desperately jocular” mask persists because isolation isn’t eradicated—only outmaneuvered. The tightening forecloses her solitary role; she becomes weather passing through tents, no longer central but necessary.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: logistics as love, reciprocity as architecture, rumors as lifelines. No moralizing—the moon rock’s “gift” is revealed as collective belief (“rumor made it glow”), not magic. Final image reweights everything: leaving the rock where ivy can “test its patience” implies healing is slow, green, and communal. The central question—can loneliness be cured without naming it?—is answered non-literally: yes, through shared vulnerability disguised as polite anarchy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is singularly lyrical yet precise: “polite anarchy remembering its manners,” “answers found mouths like water finds slope.” Perceptual signature is consistent—Mara notices systems (rail lines, rumor chains, ledgers) and emotional mechanics (“joke sent ahead to catch a falling person”). Syntax modulates with pressure: short clauses during negotiation (“She arrived with both plus a spare wire”), flowing cadence in reflection. No head-hopping; even crowd scenes filter through Mara’s observant distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: “suitcase that never rattled” implies secrecy; “fingerprint constellations” visualizes intimacy. Figurative language is coherent—ivy, roots, rails, and rumors all extend the organic-systems motif without muddle. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances character or stakes. Minor deduction for one slightly over-ornate phrase (“whisper adjusting its coat”), but rhythm varies naturally and closure image (“ivy could test its patience”) lands with quiet propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms disaster-relief tropes through poetic logistics: flour for stories, wrenches for lullabies. The moon rock isn’t sci-fi but social technology—its power is belief catalyzed by reciprocity. “Polite anarchy” feels freshly coined yet inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure, conceptual protagonist) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration—community as unasked-for gift—feels specific to this voice and crisis, resisting generic hope.</comment>
