<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Corridor Echo Cartographer’s motivation—rooted in generational legacy and perceptual sensitivity—drives consistent, embodied choices. Her internal conflict between obsession and preservation manifests in micro-decisions (e.g., trembling fingers extracting diaries, pressing the wall). The final renunciation of mapping for honoring feels earned, though the emotional shift leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains concrete and character-specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: walls dream not of the past but of being remembered, reweighting the entire premise. The film strip’s transformation from talisman to key, paired with the mirror-window, delivers undeniable conceptual cost—her purpose shifts from extraction to stewardship. Causality is tight under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each sensory detail builds toward the resonant final image. Orientation anchors firmly by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage functions as micro-setting that actively constrains and guides: ivy “watches,” walls “breathe,” and spatial narrowing pressures her forward. Humidity, ash, and moss are tactile and POV-filtered, never catalogued. The climate-shift context subtly informs decay without exposition. Final chamber’s smooth walls contrast prior texture, charging the closure—environment directly shapes the thematic pivot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—fulfilling legacy by mapping intangible echoes—tightens when diaries warn “to listen is to lose oneself,” raising personal risk. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she chooses to press the wall despite warning, activating the chamber. Cost is felt in the burden’s transformation into purpose, though the price lacks tangible sacrifice (no tool lost, time spent, or physical toll). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via sensory intensification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as active witness, not passive archive. The mirror-window reframes “dreams” as longing for recognition, answering the central question without moralizing. Subtext thrives in objects—the film strip’s latent map, charred diaries—avoiding abstraction. Final image reweights all prior particulars: ivy parts not magically, but because her stance has shifted, making resonance feel inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable, immersive first-person with a distinct perceptual signature—she hears “hum of history,” sees “flicker of light” others miss. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer, lyrical sentences early; tighter phrasing near climax (“She pressed her hand…”). No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon. Voice avoids therapy-speak; rhythm supports Accumulative drive without monotony or scaffold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “walls breathing with whispers,” “tendrils curling like fingers” avoid purple excess. Sentences vary in structure and length; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Minor figurative density in high-pressure moments (e.g., “dreams growing louder, more insistent”) borders on overwriting but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops, synonym churn, or register drift; closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise—mapping walls’ dreams—is transformed through specific, grounded execution: climate-ravaged setting, damaged film negative, scholar’s ashes. Tropes (hidden chamber, ancestral burden) feel renewed by tactile detail and conceptual twist (memory as reciprocity). Risk-taking in lyric design heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration feels both surprising and inevitable, avoiding template safety.</comment>
