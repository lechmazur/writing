<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—searching for where unused love is stored—is idiosyncratic yet grounded in her psychometric practice, and her interiority avoids diagnostic labels. Her final decision to take the film strip feels earned through embodied reactions (trembling hands, tracing edges) and micro-choices under pressure. However, the emotional progression leans slightly tidy: the shift from curiosity to purpose lacks a contradictory impulse acting *in scene*. The cost of carrying this repository is felt but not dramatized as a tangible tradeoff.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with density increasing through layered letters that merge into a conceptual whole. Closure arrives via Charged Poise: Elara’s choice crystallizes stakes (“it didn’t have to stay that way”) with legible emotional cost. Orientation is clear by line 30 (who, where, when). A minor flaw: the projector’s magical function isn’t cued early enough as a rule, risking slight causality softness—but the lyric mode absorbs this.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The projection booth functions as a potent micro-setting: dust, moonlight, and outdated equipment aren’t backdrop but active constraints that shape Elara’s tactile engagement. The film strip itself acts as object-as-setting, charging the final image when tucked into her bag. Sensory detail is selective (worn railing, hushed thunder hum) and filtered through Elara’s psychometric attention. The theater’s “humming walls” at the end reconfigure the space from relic to living archive, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locating unused love—is signaled early and deepens when the film reveals itself as a repository. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to incubate, then to remove the strip, foreclosing its abandonment. Cost is felt (“more questions than answers,” personal reckoning with unspoken loves) but not fully materialized as a concrete forfeiture. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift from still frames to merging letters constitutes sufficient intensification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the film’s letters—love as residual energy rather than transaction—and avoids moralizing. The central question (“Where does unused love go?”) receives a non-literal answer: it can be carried forward, not just stored. Subtext thrives in silence and gesture (tracing edges, descending stairs). However, the epiphany borders on abstract (“sense of purpose”) without anchoring the thematic weight in a specific, irreversible loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, with a perceptual signature shaped by Elara’s psychometric sensitivity (“pulsed with quiet energy,” “sorrow and hope intertwined”). Syntax modulates with pressure: shorter sentences during the reading, lyrical flow in reflection. No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon. The voice remains consistent even in heightened moments, avoiding therapy-speak or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is evocative with strong information density (“each step a whisper of history”), though occasional figurative stacking (“hushed thunder,” “forgotten lyrics searching for a tune”) slightly dilutes clarity in peak beats. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one near-redundancy: “unused love was stored here… but it didn’t have to stay that way” echoes prior lines. Sentence openings vary; rhythm supports emotional cadence. Final line lands cleanly without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise—psychometry applied to archival film as vessel for emotional residue—is fresh and coherently executed. Tropes (haunted theater, unsent letters) are transformed through Elara’s spatially imaginative quest and the film’s mechanical magic. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight: the projector doesn’t show images but *incubates* emotion. Risk-taking (lyric structure, conceptual stakes) heightens meaning without gimmickry, though the “unused love” concept edges close to abstraction without a grounding human counterweight.</comment>
