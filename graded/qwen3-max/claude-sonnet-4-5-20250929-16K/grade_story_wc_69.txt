<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is richly embodied—her “expectantly resigned” posture, tactile connection to the zither, and history of “unlearning hatred” ground her in specific emotional terrain. Her micro-choices (inviting one voice at a time, guiding subtraction) reveal a hierarchy of values: listening over performance, humility over dominance. The students’ hesitant harmonies show credible emotional progression without tidy resolution. No diagnostic label-speak; flaws like lingering suspicion are dramatized through absence (“Some students stopped coming”).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final harmony crystallizes their altered stance toward difference, with visible cost in those who left. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story deepens via repeated sessions, each stripping noise to reveal shared humanity. The library setting, zither, and method cohere causally; no teleporting props or amnesia. Cost is legible in the frost-painted windows and Mira’s lifting resignation—possibility earned through attrition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The velvet library functions as micro-setting: its autumnal hush enables the subtractive method, and its spatial choreography (half-circle chairs, shared table) pressures proximity without forcing intimacy. Sensory detail is selective—amber light, heating pipes, falling leaves—and evolves with the season, culminating in frost that mirrors internal thaw. The zither’s rosette charges the final image, making the environment inseparable from thematic closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harmony across inherited divisions—is signaled early and tightens through weekly attrition and vocal braiding. Mira’s agency drives escalation: her method forces students to confront silence before sound, narrowing options from suspicion to tentative trust. Cost is felt in departures and the weight of history (“accents still carried distant mountains”), though the pressure remains situational rather than intensely causal. Coincidence never resolves; change stems from sustained attention.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: vanishing arts mirror vanishing capacities for cross-cultural listening. The zither’s rosette petals (listening, humility, etc.) aren’t moralized but enacted through vocal braiding. Final image reweights the premise—harmony isn’t unity but interdependence—without stating a moral. Ambiguity lingers (some leave), resisting false equivalence while affirming that connection persists only where chosen.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Mira notices sound textures (pipes, breath, zither notes) and spatial stillness with a musician’s precision. Voice modulates under pressure—shorter sentences during instruction, lyrical flow in reflection. POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping despite multiple characters. Diction stays within her lexicon (“subtract,” “braid,” “rosette”) without academic drift. Dialogue is sparse but idiosyncratic (Aisha’s “clear water” voice vs. Thomas’s hymnal hesitance).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “velvet library wore autumn like a shawl” establishes texture without purple overload. Sentences vary rhythmically—long descriptive lines yield to imperative brevity (“Close your eyes”). No paraphrase loops; every image serves pressure or closure. Minor density in opening paragraph risks slight overwriting, but payoff in final zither passage justifies it. Zero scaffold or filter-verb stacks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms the “healing through art” trope via specificity: the zither’s extinct craftsmanship, the subtractive (not additive) harmony method, and autumn’s temporal pressure feel fresh. Emotional truth outweighs novelty—Mira’s quiet exhaustion and students’ fractured loyalties avoid sentimentality. Risk-taking (lyric structure, minimal plot) heightens stakes by focusing on attention as action. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight, not templated.</comment>
