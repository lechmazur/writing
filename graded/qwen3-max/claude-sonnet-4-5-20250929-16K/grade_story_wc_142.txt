<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—mediator by day, resistance architect by night—is embodied through precise micro-choices (e.g., trembling brushstroke that accidentally signals evacuation). Her dual allegiance drives every action without diagnostic self-awareness, and her final proposal emerges organically from accumulated pressure. The foundation stone chip anchors her emotional arc without sentimentality. Marcus functions as a credible secondary pressure point, not a foil.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the council vote remains uncertain, but Mira’s unified stance crystallizes options with visible cost (“sink separately” vs. “reorganize together”). The causal lens holds—each beat tightens stakes (water rights threat → accelerated timeline → cooperative pivot). Orientation is immediate and vivid; the raft city’s fragility shapes all decisions. Cost is legible in the frayed cables, displaced families, and overwritten graffiti.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The raft city isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint: rotting platforms necessitate investment, carnival chaos enables covert art, spatial choreography (Ferris wheel, hall of mirrors) guides resistance tactics. The foundation stone chip evolves from relic to seed, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective (paint-splattered overalls, sugar-drunk tourists) and filtered through Mira’s professional urgency. Setting directly enables the climax: cooperative talks happen *because* privatization is inevitable without infrastructure renewal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving community amid necessary change—is signaled early and tightens coherently: demolition → water rights threat → accelerated timeline → cooperative compromise. Mira’s agency drives escalation (graffiti → reorganization → equity proposal), each move narrowing options with tangible cost (erased messages, lost trust, physical exhaustion). The “three weeks” clock pressures tactics without contrivance. Final trade-off—partial ownership over total displacement—is morally complex and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: gentrification reframed as collective survival, not nostalgia. The graffiti’s transformation—from resistance codes to cooperative blueprints—offers a non-literal answer to “how to evolve without erasure.” No moralizing; hope is hard-won (“desperate hope”) and fragile (vote “not guaranteed”). The foundation stone’s reweighted meaning encapsulates the core question: preservation as adaptation, not stasis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV with controlled psychic distance; narration stays tightly bound to Mira’s sensory and professional priorities (“orderly intuitive thinking”). Voice modulates under stress—shorter sentences during the yellow-streak accident, lyrical cadence in sunset murals. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful (Marcus’s “privatization is coming” carries subtextual weight). Prose rhythm mirrors carnival chaos then focused resolve, never slipping into exposition or omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density: “prefabricated entertainment modules” conveys gentrification in four words; “drunk on sugar and spectacle” fuses setting and theme. Zero paraphrase loops; syntax varies naturally (fragments for tension, flowing clauses for reflection). One minor slip: “hopeful desperation transformed into desperate hope” borders on abstract but is grounded by immediate context. Figurative language is purposeful (stone as anchor/seed) and never muddled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: floating carnival as microcosm of urban displacement, resistance via folk art turned governance tool. Tropes (gentrification, secret codes) are grounded in specific mechanics (wave curvature = danger/meeting time). The cooperative solution avoids binary thinking while honoring both sides’ realities. Bold risk: making bureaucracy (equity shares) feel revolutionary through Mira’s lived stakes and the raft city’s literal instability.</comment>
