<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s calmly inventive nature manifests through embodied micro-choices—tracing coded angles, leveraging her sentinel access—that reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Her internal contradiction (guardian vs. saboteur) operates simultaneously without summary, and her competence is balanced by genuine risk (Captain Voss’s near-discovery). The final Charged Poise crystallizes her renunciation of passive guardianship in favor of active revolution, foreclosing safety with legible stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the blackout’s return of light masks irreversible change, reconfiguring the fort’s meaning with conceptual cost (prisoners’ lives, Mira’s exposed position). The Causal lens holds—Kael’s sabotage enables Mira’s move, which triggers network confirmation—and the sundial’s coded system drives every turn. Cost is legible in the “seventeen confirmations” and the 72-hour deadline, making before/after stark without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The luminous fort isn’t backdrop but constraint: its glow normally exposes movement, so the blackout enables revolution. The sundial functions as micro-setting—its half-painted state permits Mira’s coded angles, directly shaping tactics. Final image (“cradle of sparks ignited”) charges the setting with thematic weight, proving environment alters choice. Sensory detail (texture of paint, chiming keys) filters through Mira’s professional attention.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freeing prisoners before sealing) tightens via the blackout—a protagonist-driven escalation that narrows options to a 72-hour window. Pressure coheres under Causal lens: each beat (sundial decoding, message exchange) compounds toward irreversible action. Cost is unmistakable (“two dozen prisoners,” Mira’s exposure), and agency drives every turn—luck complicates (Voss’s patrol) but doesn’t resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: revolution as quiet, collective reconfiguration (“whispered conversations, shared glances”) versus the Council’s performative control. The cradle-of-sparks metaphor evolves from literal sundial to societal ignition, reweighting “vigilance” from obedience to resistance. Final image offers non-literal answer—change thrives in darkness unseen—without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers (will they succeed?) but cost is undeniable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is flawlessly controlled: Mira’s perceptual signature notices mechanisms, textures, and security rhythms, never drifting beyond her knowledge. Voice modulates under pressure—terse during Voss’s approach, lyrical in reflection—with rhythmic control (e.g., “winking hush in her step”). No head-hopping; even Kael’s role is filtered through Mira’s certainty. Diction stays within her lexicon (“bolts,” “gnomon”), avoiding register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “darkness swallowed everything without warning” advances atmosphere and plot. Figurative language is purposeful (“cradle of sparks”) without muddle, and sentence openings vary (“She moved...”, “Her bronze quill...”, “Footsteps echoed...”). One minor scaffold: “calmly inventive nature had never been suited...” slightly tells, but it’s offset by immediate showing. No loops or artifacts dull the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms rebellion tropes through specificity: revolution via geometric coding on an abandoned sundial feels fresh yet inevitable. The “luminous fort” premise gains originality through its inversion—light as surveillance, darkness as liberation. Risk-taking (silent network, no violence) heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the synthesis of lock sentinel + cryptographer feels singular. Emotional truth anchors novelty.</comment>
