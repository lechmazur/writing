<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dalton’s grief is embodied with precision—his lantern-broker instincts refract memory through light and scent, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. His micro-choices (sleeping in the greenhouse, uncorking the vial beside the bloom) reveal a hierarchy of values: fidelity to lived context over molecular replication. The contradiction between professional mastery of absence and personal inability to metabolize loss drives every beat. Final renunciation—carrying the vial as a tended lantern—is earned by causality and charged with irreplaceable cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “the smell remembers when she was alive, and this one never met her” reweights the entire premise with undeniable emotional cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through sensory contrast, patterned imagery (lantern/glass/flame), and cadence shift at blooming. Orientation anchors instantly (“greenhouse,” “Dalton,” present tense). Every beat tightens around the central question; no causality breaks or amnesia.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: extinct plants enforce sterility, restoration lamps enable UV analysis, observation room permits vigil. Sensory specificity is purposeful—absence of scent, ultraviolet shadows, crystal refraction—all filtered through Dalton’s profession and grief. Final image of “crystal shadows dancing” charges closure by merging setting, tool, and emotional reckoning. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding why scent unmoors him—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: he initiates the test, waits three days, performs the side-by-side comparison. The meaningful tightening occurs at blooming: identical scents yield divergent emotional responses, foreclosing the hope that replication equals resurrection. Cost is felt in his tears for the old vial alone—irreplaceable context cannot be engineered. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence or soft reset.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the lantern/scent duality: memory resides not in the molecule but in the lived moment it once inhabited. The final insight—“it’s that the smell remembers when she was alive”—offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (Miren’s tissue) and gesture (corking the vial). Avoids sentimentality by grounding epiphany in concrete particulars: kitchen window, morning light, her hands.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-limited, filtered through Dalton’s perceptual signature: he notices light angles, molecular glows, sterile gloves—details shaped by his trade. Voice modulates rhythmically: shorter sentences during tension (“They were identical.”), lyrical flow in reflection. No head-hopping; Miren’s dialogue carries clinical compassion distinct from Dalton’s interiority. Prose-as-character evident in syntax that mirrors his lantern-broker precision (“coax maximum luminescence from minimal fuel”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or conflict. Figurative language is pattern-taught (lantern/glass/flame motif) and payoff-earned at closure. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; high information density (“molecular structures invisible in normal light” conveys authentication method and emotional subtext). Final paragraph’s cadence (“light in a careful vessel, through whatever darkness remained”) varies rhythm purposefully without purple excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms familiar grief tropes through specific synthesis: lantern brokerage + extinct botany + olfactory memory creates a fresh frame where light and scent interrogate loss. Emotional truth outweighs novelty—Dalton’s realization feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (scientific resurrection vs. personal memory) heightens stakes without gimmickry. No derivative echoes; voice and concept cohere as singular artistic stance.</comment>
