<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren’s “carefully reckless” interiority is embodied in her micro-choices—pausing with the ink well, choosing solitude—and Kael’s restrained anger gives way to authentic re-engagement without sentimentality. Their contradictory impulses (trust vs. hurt, collaboration vs. secrecy) operate simultaneously, not sequentially. The final hand-covering gesture crystallizes earned reconciliation with visible relational cost. Voice distinction in dialogue (“symphonies of truth” vs. procedural “show me”) reinforces individuality without convergence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ink well reframed from “frozen tear” to “prism,” with tomorrow’s divergent paths held in tension by their renewed promise. The causal lens holds—Maren’s silence → discovery → proof → restored trust—with each beat narrowing options (Kael’s appointment, Maren’s departure). Cost is legible in the “last hour” and foreclosed permanence of separation. Orientation anchors instantly: archive, lamp, two linguists.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The extinct language archive isn’t backdrop but crucible—the sealed containers pressure their urgency, while the glass ink well functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (shared tool = broken/renewed covenant). Sensory detail (amber light, dust motes) filters through academic POV, avoiding tourist catalog. Final image charges the ink well with transformed meaning, fulfilling the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography remains coherent across table-bound gestures.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring collaborative trust through linguistic revelation—is signaled early and tightens via Maren’s confession (“I had to pursue it alone”). Protagonist agency drives escalation: her “carefully reckless” solitude enables the method, which Kael validates, crystallizing their stance. Cost is unmistakable: tomorrow’s irreversible divergence, rendered poignant by the “last hour” bell. Pressure coheres under causal lens without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: dead languages’ “harmonic patterns” mirror fractured human connection, with silence and syntax as dual vessels of loss and repair. The ink well’s transformation—from tear to prism—offers non-literal resolution without moralizing. Subtext thrives in what’s unsaid (six months of absence) and embodied (tapping fingers, shared notation). Avoids tidy binaries; trust is restored yet paths still diverge, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV remains tightly focalized through Maren with controlled psychic distance; Kael’s interiority is inferred through action (“fingers tapped,” “eyes bright”), avoiding head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct: academic precision (“promise-structures,” “Proto-Sarvene”) fused with poetic restraint (“frozen tear,” “cautious joy”). Dialogue carries subtext—Kael’s “The Verdanti texts” implies understanding without exposition. Rhythm modulates under pressure: longer sentences for reflection, fragments for tension (“Show me.”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density—each sentence advances character, plot, or atmosphere (“passing it back and forth like a promise”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (light/shadow motifs) and payoff-integrated (prism image). Minor overwriting in “interconnected notation” slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops or scaffold. Sentence variety supports emotional cadence; closure line (“infinite possibility”) resonates without purple prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of linguistics and grief feels inevitable: extinct languages’ “harmonics” as metaphor for human reconciliation avoids trope through specific mechanics (“promise-structures”). Risk-taking in conceptual framing (“symphonies of truth”) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Irreplaceable details (Verdanti texts, glass ink well) ground abstraction. No derivative echoes; authenticity of vision coheres across voice, setting, and theme.</comment>
