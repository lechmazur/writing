<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus’s motivation—to understand time’s texture—is embodied through tactile interactions (urn fragment, silo glass) and micro-choices (climbing the ladder, fitting the shard). His internal conflict between inherited duty and a world without numbers feels lived-in, not abstract. The urn’s warmth at the end signals earned transformation without sentimentality. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises from sensory stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: time redefined as breaths, weight, and seasons, not numbers. The emerald silo scene teaches disorientation early (“numbers lost meaning”), then pays it off via Chen’s projection. Cost is legible—Marcus abandons futile quantification for embodied knowledge. Causal lens holds: each action (finding urn, climbing silo) directly enables the revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The emerald silo isn’t backdrop—it filters light to alter perception, making it a tool that enables Marcus’s epiphany. The urn fragment’s jagged edge pressing his ribs grounds abstraction in body. Green glass and concrete floor create a sensory crucible where “timekeeping” becomes tactile. Every detail serves the central stake: measuring the immeasurable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—tracking time without numbers—is signaled by line 3. Pressure tightens when the urn fragment clicks into place, shifting Marcus from collector to inheritor. Cost is visible: he carries Samuel’s ashes not as relic but as key, accepting emotional weight over precision. Escalation stems from his agency, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through Chen’s diagrams mapping grief’s duration and bird songs to spring—time as shared human texture. The final image (urn fragment warm in pocket) reweights all prior artifacts as vessels of meaning, not data. Avoids moralizing; wisdom arises from tactile experience. Central question—how to measure being alive?—answered non-literally through sensation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled first-person limited, with perceptual signature (“numbers meant nothing now, just shapes”). Voice modulates from weary to awed without register drift. Prose rhythm mirrors thematic cadence: short clauses for urgency (“He climbed”), lyrical flow for revelation (“heartbeat underneath everything”). No head-hopping; even Chen’s projection filters through Marcus’s hope.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density: “heavy as three summer storms” conveys weight, era, and new linguistic norms in one phrase. Varied syntax avoids monotony; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats (e.g., projection reveal). Minor overwriting in “monument to an era when numbers still meant something”—slightly abstract—but quickly grounded by the urn’s physicality. No loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise transforms post-apocalyptic tropes: collapse isn’t violent but semantic, and salvation lies in poetic measurement. Urn-as-key and garage-sale epistemology feel fresh yet inevitable. Risk-taking (abandoning causality for textural timekeeping) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision coheres—every element serves the thesis that time is felt, not counted.</comment>
