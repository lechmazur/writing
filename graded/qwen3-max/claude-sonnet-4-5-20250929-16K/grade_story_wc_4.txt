<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her “grammar of grief” manifests through tactile choices, not diagnostic labels. Thomas’s hesitation at the lavender border reveals status and history without exposition. The final renunciation isn’t tidy; pain persists but is reconfigured, with cost felt in the indented chair and silent kitchens. Motivation flows from consistent traits: her archiving isn’t curatorial but catalytic, compelling higher-stakes communal action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the group’s planning in dusk light crystallizes new options while preserving loss. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—photographs accrue into arcs that reweight despair into shared possibility. Cost is legible in the empty workstation photo and the “worry thick as smoke.” Orientation anchors instantly: Mira, chain-link fence, dove gray case—no disorientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lavender field constrains choice—it’s a liminal space Thomas hesitates to cross—and charges the final image as scent “sweet and persistent” amid ruins. Vines climbing rusted walls mirror Mira’s work: nature and art both archive through slow overlay. Sensory detail is selective (rust snag, purple blooms, indented chair) and filtered through Mira’s professional attention. The factory’s decay isn’t backdrop but active collaborator in the healing pattern.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmuting collective pain—is signaled early and deepens when Thomas recognizes “everyone’s pain.” Mira’s agency drives escalation: her arrangement forces confrontation, then conversation, then communal decisions. Cost is visible in the donated photos’ raw vulnerability and the foreclosed path of private suffering. One meaningful tightening suffices: the shift from solitary grief to mural planning tightens social stakes without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: photographs overlapping like constellations, lavender reclaiming ruins. No moralizing—“collective healing” is shown, not stated, in the group’s tentative voices rising “like birdsong.” The final image reweights pain as raw material for beauty, answering the central question (“What does your pain look like?”) non-literally through shared creation. Complexity remains: scars aren’t erased, only rearranged.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, filtered through Mira’s perceptual signature—she notices “arcs” in stems and sorrow. Voice modulates with pressure: lyrical during arrangement (“meaning emerged like constellations”), spare during dialogue (“Come see”). Syntax varies purposefully; short sentences punctuate Thomas’s arrival. No head-hopping—even group scenes stay anchored to Mira’s observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “worry hung thick as smoke” does triple duty (image, emotion, setting). No loops or scaffold—each sentence advances plot or atmosphere. Minor overwriting in “subtle puzzle archivist” (slightly abstract), but compensated by concrete beats like “chair still indented.” Final line (“rearranged into grace”) resonates without sentimentality, echoing the opening rust motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms the “healing through art” trope via specific mechanics: pain visualized as black-and-white arcs, archived in a map case. The “subtle puzzle archivist” premise feels fresh because her method is tactile and communal, not therapeutic. Risk-taking in quiet climax pays off—the decision to plant lavender feels earned, not symbolic convenience. Vision coheres: every element serves the core idea that broken things reveal wholeness when properly arranged.</comment>
