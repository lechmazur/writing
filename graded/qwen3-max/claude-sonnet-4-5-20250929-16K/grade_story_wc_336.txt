<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Esme’s motivation—preserving wonder—is embodied through precise, character-specific actions (e.g., grafting essences, kneeling on wet stone). Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest physically (“hands cramped,” “joints protesting”). The final choice—planting the seed across worlds—is earned by decades of pruning discipline and prior observation of thin places. Minor deduction: internal conflict leans more toward resolve than contradiction, slightly softening tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Esme endures physical cost to preserve essence, foreclosing total loss with visible sacrifice. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via sensory layering and cross-world glimpses until the seed is charged. Cost is legible in her aching body and the irreversible act of weaving. Orientation anchors immediately (“dawn,” “mist,” “waterfall,” “Esme”), satisfying early clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The parapet isn’t backdrop—it’s a liminal tool enabling world-weaving; mist reveals other gardens only here. The shears and seed function as micro-settings that constrain action (shears for pruning/grafting, seed as vessel). Final image charges the waterfall’s “radiant hush” with renewed purpose. Deduct 0.1: weather (burning-off mist) affects mood but not tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—saving the tree’s essence—is signaled early and tightens when Esme risks bodily strain to braid essences. Agency drives escalation: her pruning knowledge enables cross-world perception. Cost (aching knees, cramping hands) alters nothing tactically but charges closure emotionally. Could deepen pressure: no tangible consequence if she fails, slightly muting stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme—wonder as fragile, cross-world inheritance—emerges through concrete acts (grafting color, capturing breath-caught awe), not abstraction. Final image reweights loss: the unchanged seed now carries multiversal resonance. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers (will it grow in one world or many?). Recurring “radiant hush” shifts from atmosphere to active preserver of meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-limited, filtered through Esme’s gardener-perception (“branches reach toward spaces that shouldn’t exist”). Voice modulates rhythm: longer sentences for contemplation, clipped phrases for physical strain (“She knelt... placed the seed”). Distinct perceptual signature: light, color, and sound carry emotional weight. No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon (“verdant,” “insatiably” feel organic).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“handles worn smooth by three generations”). Figurative language is purposeful (“luminous coral-gold that seemed to hold dawn itself”) without muddle. Minor scaffold: “patient observation” and “insatiably creative” border on label-speak but are quickly dramatized. Zero loops; paragraph cuts heighten cadence (e.g., short beat before closing smile).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms “magical gardener” trope via specific craft: essence-grafting as pruning extension. Core concept (world-thinning parapet) feels inevitable through botanical logic (“roots care nothing for human boundaries”). Fresh synthesis: conservation as cross-dimensional act. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over plot) heightens thematic stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
