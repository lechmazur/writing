<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her hesitation, moral uncertainty, and eventual resolve arise from specific sensory cues (ticket stubs, projector lens) rather than abstraction. Viktor’s confession via doodles reveals a credible, flawed psyche without safety-hedging. Their micro-choices (eavesdropping, producing the lens, speaking plainly) expose hierarchies of value with visible cost: Mira risks professional isolation; Viktor surrenders his curated identity. The emotional progression avoids tidy resolution—Viktor crumples, doesn’t repent cleanly—and voice distinction in dialogue (Elena’s firmness vs. Viktor’s fragility) sharpens under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the trio walking “toward accountability” crystallizes options reconfigured by truth, with cost legible in Viktor’s resignation and institutional exposure. The Causal lens holds—Mira’s discovery → eavesdropping → confrontation → collective action—and the projector lens functions as both clue and symbol that tightens causality. Orientation is anchored crisply by line 3 (“quiet night registrar for the Memoria Concert Hall”), and the single-scene-with-flashback structure fits Track A defaults. Cost is undeniable: “No more silence. No more ambiguity” forecloses Viktor’s hidden life and Mira’s passive complicity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt isn’t backdrop—it constrains choice (Mira’s rounds reveal clues), charges the final image (“tiles reflected light like scattered evidence”), and evolves with weather (post-rain clarity mirrors moral exposure). The projector lens, treated as micro-setting, directly enables the climax. Sensory detail is selective and urgent: chimes “musical tones,” tiles “fractured rainbows,” archive “cold wall”—all filtered through Mira’s professional familiarity. The setting’s luminous precision embodies the story’s thematic demand for transparency, fulfilling the 9+ gate by charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—moral accountability in institutional silence—is signaled early and deepens when Mira shifts from observer to actor. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her decision to eavesdrop (not coincidence) uncovers Viktor’s confession, forcing her to choose between complicity and confrontation. The tightening forecloses Mira’s prior paralysis (“I thought maybe it wasn’t my place”) and Viktor’s hidden life, with cost felt in his crumpled face and their joint walk toward consequences. Pressure remains coherent under the Causal lens, though Elena’s role slightly dilutes singular focus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from ticket-doodles-as-confession and lens-as-truth-tool, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights “ambiguously clear” into a call for “transparency,” offering a non-literal answer: honesty requires action, not just art. Subtext thrives in silence (chimes, rain-washed night) and gesture (Viktor covering his face, Mira placing stubs on the table). The resonant hush isn’t emptiness but charged space where accountability becomes possible—complexity lingers (theft isn’t excused, but conscience is honored), resisting binary judgment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose carries a distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices bureaucratic dissonance (“projection numbers didn’t match attendance”) and aesthetic detail (“fractured rainbows”) with registrar-specific bias. Voice modulates under pressure—sentences shorten during eavesdropping, then expand into declarative resolve (“Transparency thaws mistrust”). Dialogue is sparse but indirection-rich (Viktor’s “I can’t keep pretending” avoids direct admission until Mira intervenes). No head-hopping; focalization stays tightly bound to Mira’s knowledge, with elision (Viktor’s crimes summarized, not listed) serving thematic compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft shows high information density: “crumpled concert pass covered in cryptic doodles” conveys object, state, and mystery in one phrase. Rhythm varies purposefully—lyric opening (“crystal whispering forecourt gleamed”) shifts to taut confrontation (“I’ve been finding these”). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is precise (“tiles reflected light like scattered evidence”) without muddle, and the final image (“actions remained”) ties back to the opening’s “words became unnecessary” with earned resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise—a curator confessing embezzlement via concert-ticket doodles—transforms institutional thriller tropes through specificity: the Memoria’s sacred silence, the projector lens as both tool and metaphor, Mira’s quiet authority. Emotional truth grounds ingenuity—Viktor’s shame feels lived, not contrived. The risk of using visual art as confession could feel gimmicky, but it’s earned by his occupational context (curator) and psychological need (“hidden behind official language”). Originality lies in making bureaucracy the crucible for moral reckoning, not just backdrop.</comment>
