<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mirela’s motivation—rooted in wartime loss and maternal care—is embodied through precise, ghostly actions (writing chalk messages, ringing the bell) that escalate meaningfully under pressure. Kess’s arc mirrors this with visceral specificity: her hoarding, weeping, and opening her storehouse feel earned, not illustrative. Both characters exhibit contradictory impulses (fear vs. generosity, duty vs. exhaustion) without diagnostic self-awareness. The final renunciation—Mirela thinning to gossamer to write one last message—carries visible cost and crystallizes her enduring love as collective inheritance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mirela’s spectral labor culminates in a community-wide refusal of extractive trade, reconfiguring their shared future. The causal chain is tight—ghost messages → individual awakenings → cross-faction cooperation → unified vote—with each beat narrowing options under rising stakes. Cost is legible in Mirela’s “essence thinned to gossamer” and the unanimous choice to preserve interdependence over individual wealth. The nebula’s benediction and floating arches frame this as both spiritual and practical resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The orchard planet’s low gravity shapes key actions: droplets hang suspended, butterflies dance midair, and fruit-laden branches droop visibly under abundance. The floating rock arches aren’t backdrop—they’re spatial anchors for community identity (“beneath the floating rock arches”) and literal bridges during dawn’s rose-gold light. The copper bell and chalk messages function as micro-settings that constrain tactics (pollination coordination, trust-building). Every detail serves pressure or closure, never stalls momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving collective survival against fragmentation—is signaled early and escalates cleanly: resource hoarding → failed pollination → merchant temptation. Mirela’s agency drives each tightening via chalk messages that force concrete choices (Kess opening her storehouse, work crews crossing factions). The merchant offer crystallizes the moral calculus: individual wealth vs. communal integrity. Cost is unmistakable in Mirela’s spectral depletion and the settlers’ conscious rejection of off-world currency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from ghostly labor and communal response: collective care as antidote to capitalist extraction. No moralizing—the final image of settlers writing new chalk messages reweights Mirela’s inheritance as living practice, not relic. Ambiguity lingers (will they sustain this?), but the cost of returning to old systems is made undeniable through Kess’s grief and the bell’s fading chime. Butterfly gardens, nebula, and floating arches accrue meaning through use, not declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV remains tightly focalized through Mirela’s spectral perception—selective, tactile (“pressing ethereal fingers through chalk”), and emotionally calibrated to her grandmotherly concern. Voice modulates rhythmically: lyrical during garden descriptions, urgent in message-writing, sparse at climax (“I DIED SO YOU COULD LIVE DIFFERENTLY”). Dialogue is minimal but distinct (Kess’s “brambled” voice carries grief without melodrama). No head-hopping; even crowd scenes filter through Mirela’s watchful presence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “droplets hung suspended… drifting like tears” merges setting, character, and theme in one image. Sentence openings vary (“The ghost…”, “She was…”, “Now those seeds…”), and paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold—every line advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is consistent (water/tears, light/benediction) and never muddles causality, especially in the high-stakes merchant confrontation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms ghost tropes through sci-fi specificity: a war refugee’s spectral labor sustains orchards in low gravity, with butterfly bells enabling pollination. The nebula isn’t just mood—it’s a witnessed phenomenon tied to community arrival, making hope tangible. Chalk messages as ghostly activism feel fresh yet inevitable. Risk-taking (multi-generational ghost POV, collective protagonist) heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the ending’s quiet continuation (“someone would take up chalk”) avoids tidy closure while affirming legacy.</comment>
