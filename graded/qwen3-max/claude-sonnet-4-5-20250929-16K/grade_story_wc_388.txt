<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s motivation—to excavate truth from comfortable lies—is embodied in her micro-choices (reassembling documents, burning them) and contradicted by her final act of preserving a lie. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are shown through action (“pulse quickened,” feeding papers into the stove). Vera functions as effective secondary pressure without overcomplicating the dynamic. The renunciation feels earned: Maya chooses hope over truth, with visible cost—the death of the orchard if the diamond is destroyed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Maya refuses to expose the truth, foreclosing the path of debunking at tangible cost. The Causal lens holds—each discovery leads logically to the next, culminating in a decisive moral choice. Orientation is immediate (“goggles,” “dust storm,” “orchard”), and the timeline tightens believably from arrival to dawn. Cost is legible in the final image: the orchard survives only because Maya buries the truth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The wasteland/orchard contrast isn’t backdrop—it constrains every choice. Radiation defines the stakes; the stillpoint’s boundary shapes spatial logic (“dust flowed around”). The diamond’s burial site charges the ending. Sensory detail is selective (rust-colored dust, apples heavy despite poisoned soil) and filtered through Maya’s observational bias. The setting actively enables the central dilemma: purity exists only because devastation was pushed outward.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. preservation—is signaled early and deepens when Maya learns the Institute caused the liquidation. Pressure escalates causally: shredded documents → Project Stillpoint → catastrophic trade-off. The tightening occurs when Maya realizes destroying the diamond kills the orchard. Cost is unmistakable: saving collective hope requires perpetuating a lie that blames victims. Agency drives escalation—Maya’s choices unearth then conceal the truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the ethical weight of necessary lies. Subtext thrives in silence—Vera’s tea, Maya’s burning papers—and avoids moralizing. The final image reweights the premise: the “curse” is not evil but sacrifice, making prior scapegoating tragically ironic. Complexity is preserved—no redemption, just unbearable trade-offs—and the resonant answer (“sometimes excavating truth means knowing when to stop digging”) arises from concrete action, not assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled first-person limited; narration stays within Maya’s knowledge (“she intuited,” “she could intuit”). Voice modulates under pressure—shorter sentences during document reconstruction, lyrical cadence at dawn. Dialogue is sparse but distinct: Vera’s blunt suspicion vs. Maya’s professional precision. No head-hopping; perceptual signature (“sharply observant gaze cataloging details”) remains consistent and character-specific throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere (“dust seemed to flow around the orchard rather than through it”). Syntax varies purposefully—longer descriptive lines early, fragmented urgency during reconstruction. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent (mosaic, anchor, bubble). Final line (“Sometimes excavating truth meant knowing when to stop digging”) crystallizes theme without overstatement, echoing the opening’s tactile imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms conspiracy tropes through moral specificity: the cursed diamond becomes a geometric anchor for survival-at-a-cost. The stillpoint concept feels fresh yet grounded in emotional truth—preservation demands exclusion. Risk-taking (burying truth to protect hope) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision is singular: a post-apocalyptic Garden of Eden sustained by deliberate betrayal, rendered with poetic restraint and scientific plausibility.</comment>
