<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina’s interiority is vividly embodied—her silence isn’t passive but active creation. Her micro-choices (positioning sensors, striking the tuning fork) reveal a hierarchy of values: transforming trauma into art over “rectifying” it. The contradiction between loss and discovery pulses through every gesture. Claire’s presence deepens stakes without overshadowing Marina’s singular arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Marina’s final act of mapping her own face crystallizes her stance—enduring silence not as deficit but as medium. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; thermal patterns build toward musical notation that reweights sound itself. Cost is legible in the tuning fork’s ghost-vibration and the conservatory’s unmelting frost—beauty forged from irreversible loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory functions as both environment and micro-setting: its frost etchings mirror emotional topography, and its perpetual cold enables the heat-mapping tech. Every sensory detail (velvet-lined case, spectrum bands at sunset) serves theme or constraint. The conservatory doesn’t just reflect Marina’s state—it actively shapes her method and final choice to compose from silence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translating silence into music—is signaled early and deepens when Claire’s memory generates D-minor with major lifts. Marina’s agency drives escalation: she chooses test subjects, interprets data, initiates self-mapping. The cost is felt in what’s irrevocably lost (hearing) and what’s gained (a new compositional language), charged by the tuning fork’s mute vibration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through precise particulars: frost spirals, fern curls, and thermal maps become metaphors for resilience beyond sound. The ending reweights trauma—not as something to fix but to transform—without stating a moral. “Unshaken marvels” isn’t declared; it’s demonstrated in the score’s architecture and Marina’s contentment. Subtext thrives in what’s unsaid: Claire’s trembling fingers, the silent tuning fork.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled single-third, filtered through Marina’s deafened perception—sound is absent, vibration is present. Voice modulates with emotional intensity: lyrical in observation (“frost spiraled on winterglass in mathematical perfection”), taut in action (“positioned the sensors”). Syntax mirrors silence: shorter sentences during tactile moments, flowing cadence in reflection. No head-hopping; Claire’s emotions are read, not narrated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid—each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or concept. Figurative language is purposeful (“frozen cathedral,” “ghost of what music had been”) without muddle. Rhythm varies naturally: staccato beats during sensor placement, legato during sunset refraction. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; even technical terms (“A-440,” “microexpressions”) feel organic to Marina’s expertise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise transforms disability narrative tropes: hearing loss becomes generative rather than deficit-based. The heat-mapping system feels fresh yet plausible, grounded in Marina’s scientific rigor and grief. Risk-taking (silent protagonist, emotion-to-music translation) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final image—mapping her own contentment—feels inevitable, synthesizing all elements into a singular artistic vision.</comment>
