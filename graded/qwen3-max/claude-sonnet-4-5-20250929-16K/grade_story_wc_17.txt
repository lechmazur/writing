<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation—to discover what walls dream about—is embodied through her profession, sensory perception, and micro-choices (e.g., trusting ivy’s recoil, handling charred diaries). Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest via tactile awareness (“ivy whispered against her skin”) and professional rigor. The final decision to preserve the building’s “dreams” feels earned by her accumulated sensitivity and Eleanor’s legacy. No secondary characters dilute focus—single-POV execution is precise and character-specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: architecture consciousness isn’t metaphor but literal emotional resonance processed by structures, reweighting the entire premise. Cost is legible in Mara’s inherited burden—“caring for a living thing everyone else considers dead”—and crystallized in the corridor’s sigh. Orientation anchors instantly (“ivy-veiled passage,” “Mara,” post-climate shifts), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via diaries, negatives, acoustic data until the pulse-like echo reveals the truth. Every beat tightens toward this revelation without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage functions as micro-setting that actively pressures choice: it “recoils,” “whispers,” and parts only after Mara honors the building. Tools (recording equipment) and objects (diaries, negatives) are tactilely integrated—Mara “extracts charred pages,” “holds [negatives] to dim light.” Sensory detail is selective (acoustic whine, rustling ivy, half-burned paper) and filtered through Mara’s professional bias. The setting charges the final image: the corridor sighs *because* Mara witnessed its dream.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—validating architectural consciousness—is signaled early and deepens when Mara deciphers Eleanor’s diaries and the film negatives. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her decision to trust environmental cues leads to the acoustic anomaly, then to the conceptual breakthrough. Cost is unmistakable: she inherits Eleanor’s isolation and burden of belief. The tightening occurs when the echo pattern reveals intentional modulation—narrowing options from documentation to stewardship.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as shared ecology between humans and structures. Subtext operates through recurring images—ivy as veil/skin, echoes as dreams—that shift meaning at closure (the sigh confirms reciprocity). Avoids moralizing; insight arises from concrete particulars (charred diaries, pulse-like acoustics). Final image offers non-literal answer: walls don’t “think” but metabolize emotional residue into something new—a resonant repricing of legacy, care, and listening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person limited POV is stable, with perceptual signature rooted in sonic expertise (“mapped acoustics,” “echo pattern wasn’t random”). Voice modulates under pressure: prose tightens during anomaly detection (“breath caught”), expands lyrically in reflection. Syntax mirrors focalizer’s rhythm—technical precision gives way to wonder (“walls weren’t just reflecting sound; they were modulating it”). No head-hopping; diction stays within Mara’s plausible lexicon (no academic jargon).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: sentences multitask (“ivy-veiled passage had grown denser… like refugees seeking shelter” establishes setting, backstory, and metaphor). Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors; ivy’s “whisper” aligns with acoustic motif. Minor redundancy in “sensitively perceptive” (used twice) slightly dulls immediacy, but no scaffold loops or template cadence. Final line (“the corridor sighed”) earns its lyricism through accumulated textual pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise transforms familiar tropes (haunted houses, climate collapse) via specific synthesis: echo cartography + architectural consciousness = emotional archaeology made audible. Risk-taking (buildings as dreaming entities) heightens stakes without gimmickry—the film negatives and acoustic pulse ground the concept in tangible evidence. Vision feels singular: voice, theme, and setting cohere around listening as radical care. No derivative echoes; specificity (half-burned diaries, long-exposure light patterns) ensures freshness.</comment>
