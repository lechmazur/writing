<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Garrett’s interiority is exquisitely concrete—his grief manifests through tactile memory (yellow dress, unworn shoes) and micro-choices (placing notes in cracks). His stoic sensitivity isn’t labeled but embodied in how he wades through water “cataloging every crack” while carrying emotional weight. The final act of sealing the note demonstrates a renunciation of personal closure for archival purpose, with visible cost: part of him remains “archived in stone.” Motivation is consistent, rooted in loss, and intensifies his quiet mission without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered absences until the final Charged Poise: Garrett departs, but his offering remains, crystallizing the stakes of preservation versus erasure. Orientation is immediate (“shore surveyor,” “dawn,” “drawbridge”), and the submerged pavilion functions as both setting and temporal archive. Closure lands with conceptual cost—the future surveyor may or may not understand, but the act itself forecloses oblivion momentarily. Every beat tightens the weave of presence and absence without causal slippage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion is not backdrop but active crucible: water depth dictates Garrett’s movement, light transforms ruin into cathedral, and the central column’s fissure enables the ritual. The inkwell—warm brass against palm, ink that “never seemed to dry”—constrains choice by enabling documentation where modern tools would fail. Sensory detail is selective (salt air, knee-deep water, shifting columns of light) and filtered through professional and personal history. The setting charges the final image: water catching morning light sanctifies the act of archival.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving interlaced absence—is signaled early and deepens when Garrett chooses to embed personal and communal memory into structural repair. His agency lies in attention and ritual; the meaningful tightening occurs at the column fissure, where he wrestles the note into stone, trading private grief for public legacy. Cost is legible: he accepts invisibility (“part of him would remain here”) and the uncertainty of future discovery. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with each measurement functioning as elegy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the act of measuring loss: the pavilion becomes a palimpsest of vanished lives, and Garrett’s surveying reframes documentation as devotion. The final image—inkwell warm in case, future surveyor imagined—offers a non-literal answer to whether memory can outlast material decay. Subtext thrives in silence: the empty chair, the canceled wedding, the defunct music program all resonate without explanation. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether such acts matter beyond the actor’s need to witness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, with a perceptual signature steeped in precision (“careful, measured hand”) and poetic restraint (“hushed blaze”). Syntax modulates with pressure: longer, lyrical sentences during reflection; shorter, tactile phrases during action (“He waded,” “He unscrewed”). Voice avoids therapy-speak; emotions arise through concrete detail (laughing when hem is stepped on). No head-hopping, no register drift—every word feels filtered through Garrett’s surveyor-poet sensibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “columns listing like drunken dancers,” “interlaced absence woven through presence like threads in damaged fabric.” Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, never muddled. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs (e.g., cadence slows at the inkwell, accelerates during wading). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold—each line advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Minor deduction only because one metaphor (“drunken dancers”) borders on familiar, though rescued by specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise—a surveyor as archeologist of abandoned dreams—is fresh in its fusion of technical rigor and elegiac purpose. Tropes (grieving widower, ruined pavilion) are transformed by the method: embedding notes in foundations. Originality lies in the synthesis: measurement as mourning, data as devotion. The risk of lyric abstraction is balanced by grounded details (brass inkwell, cement repair crew), ensuring emotional truth over gimmickry. Vision feels singular, not templated.</comment>
