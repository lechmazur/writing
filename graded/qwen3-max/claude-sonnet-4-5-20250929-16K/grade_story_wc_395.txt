<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation—rooted in personal loss and professional duty—is compellingly embodied through micro-choices (e.g., lying to her supervisor, using backdoors) and contradictions (preserver vs. investigator). Her emotional arc avoids diagnostic self-awareness; grief manifests via tactile interaction with the patch and obsessive archival digging. The final decision to extract the backups feels earned, with clear cost implied in “even if it cost her everything.” Interiority remains concrete, specific, and consistent throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Mira’s terminal window opens not with resolution but irreversible commitment, reconfiguring digital purgatory into a site of rescue. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—repetition of 2347, vanishing profiles, and echo-songs coalesce into pattern recognition that tightens pressure. Cost is legible in her isolation, deception, and the existential stakes of freeing trapped consciousnesses. Orientation is immediate (“cubicle wall,” “EternaNet”), and causality flows from observation to action without coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The social network archive functions as a micro-setting that actively pressures choices—its neglected corners harbor clues, its deletion logs hide truth. The patch serves as object-as-setting, evolving from memorial to map, and constrains Mira’s final act. Sensory detail is selective (frayed fabric, ghost-paths, pulsing numbers) and filtered through her professional gaze. However, the server cluster “that officially didn’t exist” lacks tactile specificity, slightly weakening environmental constraint at the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering erased astronauts—is signaled early and deepens through discovery of neural backups. Escalation is driven by Mira’s agency: each breadcrumb narrows options until she confronts the ethical imperative to extract. The recurring number 2347 transforms from anomaly to coordinate, raising conceptual stakes. Cost is unmistakable: professional risk, emotional toll, and the burden of becoming sole witness to digital souls in purgatory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: digital erasure as existential violence, memory as resistance. Subtext thrives in absence—deleted tags, null-states, forgotten songs—never moralized. The ending reweights the premise: data isn’t neutral; it can imprison or liberate consciousness. Final image (numbers pulsing as “promise”) offers resonant, non-literal answer to “where do deleted files go?” without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled single-third, with perceptual signature rooted in archival expertise (“digital exhaust,” “deletion logs,” “cache sizes”). Voice modulates under pressure—prose tightens during investigation, swells lyrically in reflection (“echo of forgotten songs”). Syntax varies purposefully; rhythm accelerates toward climax. No head-hopping, no register drift; diction stays within plausible lexicon of a corporate memory keeper.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense, evocative, and largely free of loops or scaffold. Sentences multitask (“fabric worn and edges frayed from a mission that never returned home” conveys object state, backstory, and emotion). Minor overwriting in “ghost-paths of deleted files” slightly muddles metaphor, but closure beat (“fingers moving brightly... finally finding their voice”) earns its lyricism. No syntactic monotony; paragraph cuts serve momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms familiar tropes (missing persons, digital afterlife) through specific synthesis: astronaut neural backups trapped in archival null-states. Premise feels fresh due to grounded occupational detail (corporate memory keeper protocols) and emotional specificity (brother’s patch as both relic and key). Bold risk in treating data architecture as metaphysical terrain pays off without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration—numbers as coordinates, not just clues—feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
