<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina’s motivation—rooted in grief, loyalty, and intellectual rigor—is embodied through precise actions: trembling hands on the tapestry, conservator instincts resurfacing, the visceral weight of Kiran’s vandalized portrait. Her “analytically intuitive” mind drives every choice, from arson to decryption, with visible cost (criminalization, isolation). The promise to Kiran fuels a credible endurance that culminates in Charged Poise: uploading the truth despite personal ruin. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile detail (“volcanic tenderness,” “cradled it like a child”).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the Tethani are irrefutably real, Kiran is reclaimed from erasure, and Marina’s arson is retroactively justified as preservation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the archive’s carved narratives, tapestry, and portrait coalesce into proof via pattern recognition. Cost is legible in Marina’s tears, criminal status, and the acid-scarred self-portrait. Orientation is immediate (“archive carved into basalt cliffs”), and the single-scene structure tightens pressure toward revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The basalt archive functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: dry air preserves the tapestry, carved walls guide Marina’s analysis, stone “embraces” her grief. Sensory detail is selective (headlamp beams, volcanic rock, woven fibers) and filtered through her conservator’s gaze. The setting charges the final image—daylight climb carrying proof—and mirrors thematic tension between erasure and endurance. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography (alcove, deeper chamber) tracks cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescuing Kiran’s truth from institutional burial—is signaled early and deepens when Marina deciphers the portrait’s hidden coordinates. Escalation is driven by her agency: analyzing art, photographing evidence, choosing broadcast over concealment. Cost is unmistakable: two years off-grid, branded arsonist, Kiran’s likely death. The tightening forecloses anonymity; she embraces exposure to fulfill her promise, crystallizing stance under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: burning poisoned books to protect truth, art as resistance against erasure, promises as antidotes to bureaucratic silence. The ending reweights prior material non-literally—arson becomes sacred duty, myth becomes history—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in the vandalized portrait’s surviving border symbols and the tapestry’s cord-binding ritual. Ambiguity lingers (Kiran’s fate), but the cost of truth-telling is undeniable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person-limited POV is stable, with perceptual signature rooted in Marina’s dual identity as conservator and fugitive (“memorized [the pattern] from the only photo Kiran had sent”). Voice modulates under pressure: lyrical (“archive breathed with presence”) tightens to urgent (“photographed everything”). Syntax varies purposefully—long descriptive sentences yield to fragmented resolve (“She would upload everything”). No head-hopping; all knowledge is character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: “books ghost-written to discredit the Tethani” conveys motive economically; “geometric patterns that became faces” shows narrative progression visually. Figurative language is coherent (“volcanic tenderness,” “stone memory keeping faith”). Minor redundancy in “documenting, piecing together” slightly dulls propulsion, but closure lines (“promises burn too bright to extinguish”) earn their lyricism. No scaffold loops or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms arsonist trope into preservationist act; lost civilization premise gains freshness through textile-based epistemology and academic erasure mechanics. The Tethani’s artistic trail as encrypted archive feels specific and inevitable. Risk-taking (justifying arson, centering indigenous knowledge) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Voice, theme, and structure cohere as singular vision—no template echoes.</comment>
