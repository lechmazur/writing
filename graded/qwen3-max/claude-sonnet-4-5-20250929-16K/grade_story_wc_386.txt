<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is vividly embodied—her callused palms, breath crystallizing, the weight of others’ sleep—and her motivation (to recover truth for the dead) emerges through micro-choices like mapping dreams and promising the captain. Contradictory impulses (diver vs. medium, seeker vs. protector) act simultaneously without therapy-speak. Her final renunciation—carrying the captain’s peace upward—is earned by prior causality with tangible cost: she assumes the burden of truth-telling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the Katerina’s sinking shifts from mechanical failure to moral sacrifice, reweighting climate inaction as complicity. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—dream fragments coalesce into revelation—and cost is legible in Maya’s vow and the ghost’s departure. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3; the shrine, candles, and snow globe establish who, where, when without disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glacier shrine functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its ice walls reflect candlelight like “borrowed starlight,” enabling Maya’s dream-mapping, while the aurora’s off-page dance mirrors ghostly transmission. Sensory detail is selective (diesel-tasting water, frozen eyelashes) and filtered through Maya’s wreck-diver POV. The melted snow globe charges the final image—its amber glycerin embodying preserved truth—and directly enables the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering the captain’s suppressed climate data—is signaled early and deepens when Maya interprets dream symbols as evidence of his final act. Pressure tightens via protagonist agency: her analysis narrows options from vague haunting to actionable truth. Cost is unmistakable: she commits to resurfacing painful history, trading anonymity for advocacy. Coincidence complicates (scattered dreams) but resolution stems from her interpretive labor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the snow globe’s replica ship becomes a vessel for climate witness, not nostalgia. The ending reweights “salvage” from treasure-hunting to ethical duty—truth as the only pure cargo worth drowning for. No moralizing; resonance accrues via the aurora’s “borrowed starlight” echoing ghosts and truth as reflected, distant, yet visible. Complexity endures: the world still ignores warming seas, but one conscience remains intact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-limited, with perceptual signature evident in maritime metaphors (“wreck-diver,” “listing ship”) and cold-climate lexicon (“frost-thin,” “glycerin turned amber”). Voice modulates under pressure: short clauses during dream analysis (“The Portland woman: drowning, but also falling”) contrast lyrical cadence at closure. No head-hopping; all knowledge stays character-bound. Diction remains within Maya’s plausible lexicon—no register drift even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density: “walls of ancient ice, casting borrowed starlight across surfaces that had never seen the sun” conveys setting, theme, and POV in one breath. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“borrowed starlight” returns with aurora) and avoids muddle. Minor scaffold in “seventeen candles burned. Seventeen dreams…” slightly flattens momentum, but no loops or artifacts dull the closure. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms ghost-story tropes via specific synthesis: wreck-diving meets climate activism through dream archaeology. The captain’s sacrifice reframes environmental science as sacred duty, avoiding abstraction through tactile details (waterproof containers, diesel-tasting bathwater). Bold risk: making truth recovery a quiet, solitary act rather than public crusade. Originality lies in the “windows of connection” mechanic—ghosts haunting neural pathways, not places—which feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
