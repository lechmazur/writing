<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation—planting resilience—is embodied through precise, tactile actions (decoding keys, clutching seeds) and internal contradictions (urgency vs. restraint). Her chained grace reveals a hierarchy of values: preservation over escape. The soldier’s choice at the climax reflects her earned influence without sentimentality. Final renunciation of isolation (“not alone anymore”) is causally rooted in prior endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira’s declaration crystallizes freedom’s meaning, reconfiguring stakes with conceptual cost (erasure vs. cultivation). The causal lens holds—each beat links via “because/therefore” (arrow → decoding → vault discovery → confrontation). Cost is legible in chains falling only after ideological alignment. Persistent constraint (chains) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The redemption center functions as micro-setting: carnival booth layout directly enables the seed vault’s discovery, constraining Mira’s navigation. Dusty prizes and broken windows mirror cultural erasure while grounding tactile urgency. Chains against hip bones fuse body and environment into choreography. Final image charges setting—glass jars in ruin embody hope’s fragility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving seeds as rebellion) tightens when boots approach, forcing Mira to decode faster. Agency drives escalation: her strategic patience yields the vault before soldiers arrive. Cost is unmistakable—three years imprisoned, now risking capture to protect knowledge. The soldier’s bolt cutters reweight freedom from regime-change to stewardship.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: seeds as “books that feed us,” chains as both oppression and dance. Subtext thrives in silence—the arrow’s fletching speaks louder than exposition. Final image reweights premise: liberation means cultivating memory, not just toppling power. Avoids moralizing; resonance arises from jar-in-hand gesture, not thesis statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV remains tightly focalized through Mira’s sensory perception (“iron links singing,” “dried corn husks”). Voice modulates under pressure—syntax shortens during boot sounds, expands in reflective beats. Distinct perceptual signature: agricultural lexicon (“desert marigold,” “drought-resistant”) filters all observation. No head-hopping; soldier’s interior inferred only through action (hand moving to cutters).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose balances density and propulsion: “chains like a dancer with ribbons” merges metaphor with tactic. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances plot or character. Minor register drift in “systematic deletion of knowledge” slightly elevates diction but remains plausible for Mira’s librarian identity. Final line (“reached for the seeds”) earns its simplicity through accumulated specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: seed vault hidden in carnival decay transforms rebellion tropes into agrarian resistance. Chains as choreographic tool subverts victim imagery. Risk-taking (quiet climax over violence) heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors universals—corn-husk arrow, piano-bench keys—making resilience feel lived, not allegorical.</comment>
