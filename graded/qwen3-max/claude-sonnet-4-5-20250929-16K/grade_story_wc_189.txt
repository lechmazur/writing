<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mei’s interiority is richly embodied—her observational patience contrasts with her emotional helplessness, creating authentic contradiction. Lin’s motivation emerges through subtext and inherited symbolism, not exposition. Their micro-choices (Lin producing the cicada, Mei handing it back) reveal hierarchies of value with quiet cost. The final renunciation (“I wanted to hold you here…”) is earned by prior behavior and flaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the “pause” transforms from absence to presence, legible through the hermit crab’s commitment and the cicada’s return. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via recurring threshold imagery, culminating in a cadence shift that reweights time itself. Cost is felt in Mei’s admission of wanting to preserve what cannot be held. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no disorientation penalty applies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The grotto functions as micro-setting: tidal pools constrain Mei’s attention and mirror human transience. Starlight, shells, and jade gleam with purposeful specificity, filtered through professional bias. The environment directly charges the closure—the hermit crab’s shell choice parallels Lin’s departure, and the approaching tide tightens the temporal frame. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography is precise and tactile.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—navigating transition—is signaled early and deepened when Mei realizes humans, too, live in thresholds. The tightening occurs when Lin reveals the cicada, forcing Mei to confront her own resistance. Agency is expressed through attention and renunciation, not action, consistent with the Accumulative lens. Cost is visible: Mei relinquishes control, accepting impermanence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from tidal rhythms, shell-swapping, and cicada metamorphosis—never stated outright. The final image (“learning what could only be understood in the space between”) offers a non-literal answer to the central question of how to inhabit change. Grandmother’s wisdom reframes legacy as observation, not possession. Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and the jade’s “interior weather.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Mei’s perceptual signature—her scientific patience inflects syntax and diction (“cataloging small dramas,” “tangentially rather than directly”). Voice modulates under pressure: sentences shorten during emotional peaks without losing texture. Dialogue is sparse but distinct—Lin’s lines carry generational weight; Mei’s responses are measured, observant. No head-hopping; psychic distance remains consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid—each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is precise (“stars wheeled in their own vast cycles,” “jade gleamed with its own interior weather”) without overwriting. Syntax varies rhythmically; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; the final paragraph’s propulsion toward “the space between” feels inevitable and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms the “leaving home” trope through marine chronicle and mineral timekeeping, yielding fresh emotional calculus. The synthesis of tidal biology, jade symbolism, and intergenerational silence feels specific and irreplaceable. Risk-taking in lyric structure pays off: the story trusts accumulation over causality, yet stakes remain urgent. Vision coheres—observation as love, transition as habitat—is singular and unforced.</comment>
