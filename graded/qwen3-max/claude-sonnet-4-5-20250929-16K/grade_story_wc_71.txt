<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied perception and micro-choices—her decision to enter the house, place the orris root, and commit to returning are all grounded in consistent traits. Her motivation stems from a lifelong attunement to “imperceptible shifts,” which intensifies into active participation without epiphanic rupture. The final renunciation of passive observation for witness carries visible cost: she surrenders neutrality to join the house’s sanctification. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions emerge through action (“noticing the wrong thing all along”) rather than summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Maya reinterprets “creeping normality” as “creeping memory,” reweighting the entire premise with undeniable conceptual cost—the realization that truth returns only through patient archaeology. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned displacements intensify until the kitchen revelation crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible in the final image—her commitment to return with journals implies time, emotional labor, and surrender of objectivity. Orientation is immediate and functional disorientation (sentient house) pays off precisely at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The quiet bay, spring air, and Ashford house aren’t backdrop but active constraints: lilac-and-salt density slows perception, floorboards “sing” underfoot, and spatial choreography (porch → parlor → kitchen) guides discovery. The orris root shard functions as micro-setting—it constrains the climax by fitting the windowsill’s pale rectangle, charging the final image with historical resonance. Every sensory detail filters through Maya’s perfumer-granddaughter POV, avoiding tourist cataloging. The house’s “breathing” isn’t metaphor but causal pressure shaping her choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding why houses feel alive—is signaled early and deepens when Maya realizes the house is “teaching itself to remember.” The tightening occurs in the kitchen: objects aren’t moved randomly but map 1923 placements, forcing Maya to shift from observer to participant. Cost is felt in her relinquished detachment (“no longer an observer but a witness”) and future commitment. Escalation is driven by her agency (entering, interpreting, placing the root), though the house’s sentience borders on coincidence—yet it’s earned through consistent textual cues (“windows watched her”).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: structures transcend materials when aligned with “original grammar,” a non-literal answer to Maya’s central question. Subtext operates through displaced objects as prayers, silence as sanctuary—not stated but shown via the orris root’s perfect fit and the house’s exhalation. The ending resists moralizing; instead, the “hushed blaze of understanding” reweights prior observations (e.g., “shards of hush”) with emotional honesty. Complexity is preserved—Mrs. Ashford’s ignorance of the house’s “first language” implies tragedy without redemption.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature: Maya notices olfactory traces (orris root, lilac), spatial resonances (“thresholds hum”), and temporal textures (“time moved more slowly”). Voice modulates under pressure—lyric cadence tightens during discovery (“Every displaced object began to make sense”) without register drift. Free indirect style is clean (“She’d been documenting the changes…”), and psychic distance remains consistent. No head-hopping; even the house’s “exhalation” is filtered through Maya’s somatic perception (“She felt it as a presence suddenly relaxed”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density: “water lay flat as hammered silver” conveys visual, tactile, and metaphorical weight in six words. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully—long, flowing clauses for reflection (“the slow tide of change that crept through places like water through sand”) contrast with staccato beats during tension (“The front door stood ajar”). One minor flaw: “inadvertently profound” slightly risks label-speak, but it’s immediately grounded in the house’s “patient archaeology.” No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; every image serves escalation or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms haunted-house tropes through specificity: the house doesn’t haunt but “works… to become itself again,” sanctifying history via displaced objects. Originality lies in the synthesis of perfume-curing timelines (three years for orris root = three years abandoned) and architectural memory. The “shard of hush” concept feels inevitable in hindsight, arising from Maya’s grandmother’s shop and the house’s silent corrections. Bold risk: making absence (displacement) the engine of presence, with no human antagonist—yet stakes remain visceral through Maya’s reconfigured understanding.</comment>
