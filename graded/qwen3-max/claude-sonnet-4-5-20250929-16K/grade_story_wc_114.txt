<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—her guilt, grief, and professional self-reckoning are embodied in trembling hands, smudged ink, and recalibrated sensors. Her contradictory impulses (certainty vs. doubt, duty vs. penance) act simultaneously in scene, not as summary. The final choice—to forecast from the margins—is earned by her fever-confession and tactile interaction with Eva’s illustration. Chen’s minimal presence serves only to pressure her resolve, not dilute it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Mira redefines forecasting itself by honoring uncertainty, with visible cost—the swallowed truth now held to light, the smudge as permanent mark. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: auroras fade, dawn arrives, fever recedes, and each sensory beat tightens around the central tension of margins versus certainty. The smudge incident crystallizes the past error and future stance in one irreversible gesture. Cost is legible in “some weights… became part of you forever—not burden but ballast.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mountain weather station isn’t backdrop but crucible: cold air steadies hands, altitude explains forecasting limits, and spatial choreography (observation deck → desk → window) tracks emotional progression. The botanical illustration functions as micro-setting—its margins, smudge, and backlighting directly constrain Mira’s final choice. Aurora-to-dawn shift mirrors internal transition without overt symbolism. Every detail serves pressure or closure; no white-room or tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to trust the margins of data—is signaled early and deepened when Mira admits filtering out anomalies that killed Eva. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to lower sensor thresholds despite Chen’s warning, accepting more false positives. Cost is unmistakable: “certainty is what killed her.” The tightening forecloses her old method forever, crystallizing a new ethics of forecasting under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of scientific humility and grief: truth lives in edges, not centers. The final image—illustration backlit, smudge intact—reweights the entire premise without moralizing. Eva’s flowers “emerge from white space” just as meaning emerges from uncertainty. No platitudes; wisdom arises from concrete particulars (snowpack monitors, graphite veins), resisting tidy resolution while affirming that fragility is fidelity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled single-third, with perceptual signature shaped by Mira’s meteorological precision (“probability margins,” “fault-tolerant”) and sisterly intimacy (“vein mapped in ink”). Syntax modulates with emotion: longer cadences in reflection, clipped resolve in dialogue (“Yes.”). No head-hopping; Chen’s voice remains external pressure. Diction stays within plausible lexicon—no register drift—even at peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “auroras paint the sky in shades of green and violet—beautiful and departing, like everything that mattered” fuses image, emotion, and theme in one breath. Minimal scaffolding; every sentence advances character or atmosphere. One slight overwriting risk in “swaying edges” metaphor cluster, but pattern is taught early (“margins,” “ecotones”) and pays off at closure. No loops, filters, or simultaneity errors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms the “guilt-driven expert” trope through hyper-specificity: alpine botany, snowpack sensors, fault-tolerant modeling. The synthesis of scientific epistemology and elegiac art feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (foregrounding probability theory in a grief narrative) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Voice, setting, and concept cohere into an authentic artistic stance rare in short fiction.</comment>
