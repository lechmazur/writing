<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaia’s interiority is vividly embodied—emotions manifest as sensory maps, hot stones in her chest, and tactile memories. Her final choice (“Teach me”) emerges from layered contradictions: longing vs. resentment, safety vs. truth. The mother’s presence deepens stakes without flattening Kaia’s agency. Flaws (e.g., trusting the shard implicitly) compound credibly under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Kaia crystallizes her stance amid three legible options, each with visible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story deepens through sensory density until the shard’s pulse synchronizes across dimensions. Cost is undeniable in the weight of truth and the irreversible step into weaving. Orientation anchors by line 3; disorientation serves closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The repair bay functions as micro-setting: rust, moss, snow, and engine hum directly constrain Kaia’s navigation between worlds. The green shard—tool and heirloom—charges the final image, its warmth guiding every transition. Sensory hierarchy reflects Kaia’s profession: silence has “shades,” hands feel “purple.” Environment and object jointly shape tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—carrying the truth’s weight—tightens when Kaia confronts her mother’s exile motive, foreclosing naive reunion. Escalation is driven by Kaia’s agency: she follows the shard, steps through worlds, chooses learning over escape. Cost is legible in abandonment’s duality (protection vs. loss). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via intensifying sensory currents.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the shard’s evolving resonance: truth isn’t abstract but weighted, carried, chosen. The ending reweights “abandonment” as love that bends through realities—no moral stated, only embodied in synchronized heartbeats. Subtext thrives in gaps: cardamom laughter vs. ash-tasting questions. Complexity resists binaries; protection demands sacrifice without redemption gloss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled—Kaia’s perceptual signature filters all description (“silence mapped in rust and violet”). Voice modulates under stress: short clauses during transitions, lyrical cadence in reflection. No head-hopping; dialogue distinguishes generations (mother’s aphoristic wisdom vs. Kaia’s visceral queries). Syntax mirrors sensory mapping: fragmented, synesthetic, precise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“feet finding moss where concrete should be”). Figurative language is consistent (truth as weight, worlds as petals) without muddle. Minor scaffold in “cyclically spontaneous” repetition, but no loops or artifacts dull closure. Final line’s rhythm (“engines beginning to sing”) perfectly echoes opening hum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise transforms multiverse tropes via sensory cartography—worlds aren’t traversed technologically but through taste, touch, silence. The shard’s irreplaceable specificity (mother’s legacy, thermal guide) grounds high concept in emotional truth. Risk-taking (non-causal structure, lyric density) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
