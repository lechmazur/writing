<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Alya’s motivation—redirecting hydraulic flow to solve “unsolvable” equations—is rooted in consistent traits (curiosity, stoic idealism) and intensifies through micro-choices (welding, rerouting glycol). Her interiority is concrete (“taste of brass and glycol,” “voice startled a rat”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The final renunciation—walking away while leaving hope operational—is earned by prior causality with visible cost: solitude, underfunded labor, and the weight of legacy. Her flaws (idealism bordering on obsession) complicate but don’t derail her agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Alya’s act reconfigures the terminal from mausoleum to living system, with clear conceptual cost—she sustains hope alone, without crowds or funding. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: ghostly calliope chords, raffle tickets, rusted valves build density until the brass birds’ resurrection crystallizes meaning. Orientation is immediate (“abandoned spaceport passenger terminal,” “civil engineer intern”), and every beat tightens around the core stake. The silver token spinning “longer than physics politely allows” embodies the story’s earned wonder-with-cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The abandoned terminal functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables choice: cracked biometric gate, choked filters, dry pumps—all shape Alya’s tactics. Sensory detail is purposeful (“Martian vermillion” rust, “chalk squeaking like a child’s tennis shoe”) and filtered through her engineer’s attention. The recurring sextant shard and glycol conduits evolve causally with action, culminating in the final image where the setting itself gains a “heartbeat.” Environment charges closure: the fountain’s revival proves hope isn’t abstract but fluid-dynamic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resurrecting hope via redirected flow—is signaled early and deepens when Alya realizes the “maze of intentions” points inward, not skyward. Escalation is driven by her agency: each weld, reroute, and equation scratch narrows options and raises conceptual stakes. Cost is unmistakable: she works alone, repurposes junk, and accepts that wonder must replace crowds. The maintenance drone’s reboot isn’t coincidence—it’s triggered by her glycol reroute, proving pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: hope isn’t escape but repair, measured in “degrees of reclaimed wonder.” The final equation—Hope = (Redirected Flow × Residual Heat) / Time³—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (rat fleeing, cap rotating) and image (brass birds beating air like a pulse). The architect’s hologram doesn’t preach but reframes design as resurrection, not perfection—wisdom earned through the terminal’s decay, not Alya’s epiphany.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled single-third with a distinct perceptual signature: Alya notices engineering details (valves, pictographs, fluid dynamics) over emotional abstractions. Voice modulates under pressure—shorter sentences during welding, lyrical cadence during reflection—but never loses its technical-poetic texture. No head-hopping; even the hologram’s speech is filtered through Alya’s hearing (“clipped subroutines”). Syntax mirrors her mind: precise yet wonder-struck (“ghostly calliope chords trapped in the rafters”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“raffle tickets that looked like failed star charts”) and rhythmic control (long descriptive sentences punctuated by staccato declarations like “Pressure times area equals possibility”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every image serves escalation or closure. Minor figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., “valves frozen in attitudes of prayer”) is pattern-taught and pays off in the birds’ resurrection. Final line’s “portable meridian pointing... inward” crystallizes theme without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of civil engineering, carnival decay, and cosmic hope feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (abandoned terminal, mystical artifact) are transformed by specificity: sextant etched with pre-colony meridians, glycol runoff as lifeblood. The risk—making fluid dynamics poetic—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Every detail (steward’s cap, Martian rust, pictograph arrows) is irreplaceable; remove any and the logic fractures. Vision is singular: stoic wonder as an engineering discipline.</comment>
