<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his grief manifests through tactile restraint (“aromatically cautious”), micro-choices (kneeling, pouring one drop), and professional identity fused with emotional survival. His contradiction—broker of light yet cultivator of scent-based memory—is dramatized without diagnostic labels. The final renunciation (“sell no lanterns tomorrow”) earns closure through prior causality: his handling of Lira’s vial reconfigures his purpose. No therapy-speak; emotion arises through soil, vapor, and ultraviolet revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “to grieve is to cultivate extinct perfumes… until they bloom into something that does not fade.” Cost is legible in the empty vial left among roots—a seed that won’t grow but won’t decay—and Elian’s trembling knees. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density escalates to a cadence shift at the orchid’s pulse, reweighting extinction as active cultivation. Orientation is immediate (“greenhouse for extinct plants”), and the transformation clock tightens stakes without contrivance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as both macro- and micro-setting: its UV panels, extinct soil, and ventilation ducts constrain and enable every action. The crystal vial, orchid roots, and meteor-dust soil aren’t backdrop—they catalyze the climax. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elian’s profession: smell dominates, but UV light reveals what breath cannot. Final image (“private atmosphere… crystal shadows of fragrance”) charges the setting as internalized hothouse, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving scent-memory against olfactory collapse—tightens when Elian risks inhalation, then deepens when the orchid resonates with Lira’s esters. His agency drives escalation: uncapping the vial, pouring the drop, kneeling. Cost is felt in “floral gravity collapsing his chest” and the irreversible offering of the last drop. The “transformation completes” timeframe isn’t passive—it pressures his choice before human scent vanishes entirely.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through precise particulars: grief as cultivation, extinction as latency, scent as time travel. The ending reweights all prior images—not moralizing, but crystallizing via the orchid’s new note (hospital bracelet) and Elian’s shift to “broker of invisible gardens.” Subtext thrives in silence (stolen bracelet, corked sob) and charged objects. No platitudes; wisdom arises from burnt sugar, iron soil, and ultraviolet revelation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is singularly Elian’s: a lantern broker’s lexicon (“hollow bones,” “rigid spectra”) fused with perfumer’s precision (“esters,” “receptor plains”). Syntax modulates with pressure—long, lyrical sentences for memory; short clauses for physical action (“He knelt.”). Free indirect thought is seamless (“he did not want to understand…”), and perceptual bias filters everything through scent and light. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence layers atmosphere, character, and plot (“lanterns rattling like hollow bones”). Figurative language is coherent—“crystal shadows,” “floral gravity”—and never muddled. Minor overwriting in “cathedral of invisible colors” slightly dilutes peak beats, but rhythm varies naturally, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Zero paraphrase loops; high information density sustained to the final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Premise transforms elegy into speculative ecology: grief as biotech ritual, extinction as reversible latency. Every trope (widower, greenhouse, perfume) is grounded in unique logic—olfactory collapse, UV-revealed molecules, lanterns without heat. The synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh, with bold risk in making scent architecture visible. No derivative echoes; vision is cohesive, specific, and irreplaceable.</comment>
