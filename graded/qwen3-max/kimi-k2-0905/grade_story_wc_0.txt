<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete, contradictory, and embodied—grief over her brother and professional frustration coexist without resolution. Her micro-choices (ignoring thunder, sealing the slide before packing) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final renunciation of “drama” feels earned by prior causality, not declared. No diagnostic label-speak; humility emerges through action, not assertion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: catastrophe reframed as gradual change, validated by scientific overlay with 0.003% match. Cost is legible in her relinquished urgency (“no urge to outrun the next storm”) and the greenhouse’s slow collapse behind her. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds via dust patterns, culminating in cadence shift at convergence. Orientation anchors instantly; no disorientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The storm-damaged greenhouse functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: broken panes dictate where wing dust collects, humidity affects equipment, skeletal frame channels rain onto gloves. Sensory detail (rotting orchids, galvanized steel taste) filters through Mara’s scientific bias. Final image—greenhouse collapsing as she departs—charges closure with irreplaceable specificity. Environment directly enables the thesis: decay as courtesy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—calibrating cosmic and human timescales via butterfly dust—is signaled early and tightens when the synchrotron pings at 03:17. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she chooses to work through storms, prioritize data over safety. Cost is felt in lost career momentum, unresolved grief, and physical exposure. Under Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via pattern accumulation, not causal turns—valid and coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: wing scales and neutron stars share laminar time. No moralizing; insight arises through lab work, not reflection. Final image—carrying “a butterfly’s quiet thesis”—reweights all prior material without stating a lesson. Subtext thrives in silence, rain, and sealed slides; drama’s optionality contrasts media sensationalism implicitly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: scientific lexicon fused with poetic precision (“cobalt fire,” “kindled humility”). Rhythmic control modulates with pressure—longer sentences during analysis, terse phrases during storm. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained (she doesn’t know PSR J1748-2446ad’s full name, just its spin rate). Voice remains consistent even in lyrical peaks; diction never drifts into unmotivated academic register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; nearly every line advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Minor overwriting in “humidity still clung like a guilty conscience”—mixed metaphor slightly muddles physical logic. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Closure beat (“drama is optional; change is not”) avoids summary by anchoring in embodied departure. One near-redundancy: “ruined splendor dwarfed her instruments” and later “greenhouse’s ruined splendor” — negligible drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astrophysics and lepidoptery feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes transformed: flood survivor isn’t seeking rescue but calibration; greenhouse isn’t refuge but laboratory. Risk-taking (scientific lyricism) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity abounds—Morpho menelaus, PSR J1748-2446ad, superconducting lattice—none swappable. Vision coheres as singular artistic stance: cosmic patience as antidote to human panic.</comment>
