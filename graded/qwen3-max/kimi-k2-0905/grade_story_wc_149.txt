<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ghost bride’s interiority is embodied through tactile memory and spectral limitation (“no feet to feel the cold”), while the boy’s fear and dawning understanding are rendered without sentimentality. Their contradictory impulses—her vengeance versus mercy, his terror versus offering his wrist—are dramatized in micro-choices that escalate stakes. The final renunciation of blood repayment for symbolic fruit feels earned by prior causality. Both characters avoid diagnostic self-awareness; emotion arises through image and action, not label.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Conceptual Repricing): guilt is physically extracted, the orchard withers, and the ghost gains corporeality—each change legible with tangible cost. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: pressure builds via the bead’s pulse, fruit ripening, and visitations, culminating in a cadence shift at dawn. Orientation anchors immediately (“ashen-veil ghost bride,” “alchemical orchard greenhouse”), and every beat tightens the debt-repayment logic. The final image reweights the entire premise: debts become gifts through transgenerational empathy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard functions as both setting and crucible: copper pipes feed rune-etched pomegranates, quartz-grafted quince hum, and flameless lanterns burn—all constraining choice and charging closure. Sensory detail is selective (iron air, molten silver fruit, aluminum-thread coat) and filtered through spectral perception. The greenhouse’s dissolution into moonlight petals directly enables the ghost’s grounding and the boy’s planting of a new tree. Environment actively shapes tactics and final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—repaying ancestral debt—is signaled early and deepens through each visitation, narrowing options until only symbolic fruit can balance scales. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: the ghost chooses mercy over blood, the boy offers his wrist then accepts the apricot. Cost is unmistakable: the orchard dies, the ghost scatters, and the boy inherits lifelong responsibility. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, with the bead’s pulse and fruit ripening serving as visceral intensifiers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: debt transforms into gift through intergenerational empathy, not moralizing. The cracked bead yielding a seed reweights all prior violence into possibility. Final image—a boy planting a tree needing only ordinary seasons—offers a non-literal answer to inherited guilt. Subtext thrives in gesture (frost on lashes, aluminum-thread coat) and avoids binaries; the ghost’s forgiveness carries sorrow, not absolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyrically precise with a distinct perceptual signature: the ghost notices steam, runes, and iron air; the boy perceives heat, light, and thread. Syntax modulates under pressure—shorter clauses during visitations, flowing cadence at resolution. No head-hopping; single POV (ghost) holds until the boy’s emergence, handled via clear focal shift. Diction remains within spectral lexicon (“lovingly venomous,” “broken bells”) without register drift or exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density: “pomegranate trees that bore fruit of molten silver, their skins etched with runes that pulsed when she passed” conveys setting, magic, and character in one breath. Rhythm varies purposefully—staccato during screams, legato at scattering. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (veil as smoke, debt as vine). Closure image (“seed warm against his lifeline”) is crystalline, unmarred by artifact or muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Transforms ghost-bride and debt tropes through alchemical botany and resonant objects. The synthesis of spectral haunting, botanical currency, and intergenerational justice feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risks—endless night, flameless lanterns, aluminum-thread warding—heighten stakes without gimmickry. Every detail serves conflict: the bead’s warmth, the apricot’s mirror-gold skin, the ghost’s hollow face—all irreplaceable to closure logic.</comment>
