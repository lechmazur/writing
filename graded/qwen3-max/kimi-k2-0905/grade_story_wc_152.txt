<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The embroiderer’s interiority is concrete and consistent: her micro-choices—humming reversed lullabies, folding the map carelessly, asking to read a “bedtime story”—reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her disguise of wisdom as foolishness isn’t stated but enacted, with visible cost (risk of death) and emotional embodiment (steady hands despite threat). The lieutenant’s trembling pistol crystallizes the stakes without over-explaining her motive. Flawlessly avoids diagnostic label-speak; every action aligns with her quiet, listening competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the embroidery reweights truth itself, replacing junta myths with hidden resistance networks. Cost is legible in the silenced coup, the lowered pistol, and the cloth carried away as seed. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through stitch, flame, and silence until the projector ignites the hidden layer. Every beat tightens toward this resonant reconfiguration; no causality breaks, no amnesia, no soft reset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory isn’t backdrop—it constrains and enables: stained-glass panes rattle with wind, the mirrored alcove multiplies flame into galaxies, the projector’s glass plate becomes the coup’s undoing. Autumn chill and dawn’s approach pressure timing. The eternal candle’s flame is both tool and symbol, handled repeatedly and reweighted at climax. Sensory detail (crackling thread, echoed silence) filters through the embroiderer’s professional attention—no white-room syndrome, no generic season.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving unheard stories against cultural erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the map becomes actionable intelligence. The embroiderer’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to reveal, to synchronize breathing, to rewrite the night. Cost is unmistakable: political violence averted only through personal risk. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; each stitch, hum, and fold tightens options until the final image reconfigures possibility itself.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: wisdom disguised as foolishness, listening as resistance, embroidery as counter-history. No moralizing—the final image of “quiet stars whose names no one had yet learned to fear” reweights the entire premise without stating a thesis. Subtext thrives in silence, reversed songs, and double-layered cloth. The republic’s survival isn’t victory but fragile, seeded potential—a resonant, non-literal answer to erasure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exquisitely controlled: the embroiderer notices star-threads, supply-route comets, and echoed silences—not abstractions. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer, lyrical sentences for stitching; shorter, breath-like phrases during confrontation. No head-hopping; single POV remains stable even amid group presence. Voice is idiosyncratic (“flame from eternal candle” repetition feels ritualistic, not redundant) and consistent through stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each line multitasks (e.g., “stitching Andromeda’s spiral arms while autumn wind rattled the stained-glass panes” establishes setting, action, and tension). Minor overwriting in “flame from eternal candle” (repeated verbatim three times) borders on scaffold, slightly dulling momentum. Otherwise, rhythm varies naturally, metaphors cohere (cloth as sky, silence as echo), and closure image crackles with specificity. No loops, no filter-verb stacks, no register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms espionage tropes through textile craft and feminine quietude—original without gimmickry. The synthesis of astronomy, embroidery, and coup feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric pacing, double-layered cloth, reversed lullaby) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Every element serves character and conflict; no safety hedging. The vision—listening as world-saving act—is singular, specific, and emotionally true.</comment>
