<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Myrrh’s olfactory sensitivity, ambition, and inherited ritual practice form a tightly interwoven interiority that drives every micro-choice—from seed-testing to silk-stitching—with embodied contradiction (e.g., “ambition loosen[ing] into gratitude”). Her final renunciation of control (“serenity no longer a goal but a companion”) is earned through tactile struggle and mirrors her mother’s legacy without sentimentality. The fleeting maternal encounter crystallizes relational stakes without dialogue, relying on scent-memory and breath as emotional shorthand. No diagnostic label-speak; all epiphany arises from grafting under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Myrrh accepts serenity not as conquest but companionship, foreclosing her original ambition with palpable cost (abandoning the notebook to wind-spirits). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—wildflower hush, tide reversal, and grafting ritual coalesce into a cadence shift where motion becomes stillness. Cost is legible in the final image: she descends toward the tide, no longer chasing scent. Orientation anchors instantly (“treetop village of Larkspur”), and the single scene tightens around one irreversible act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The treetop village functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: bridges narrow to “mere suggestion,” bark scars dictate graft-site, and wind-spirits demand olfactory honesty. Sensory hierarchy reflects Myrrh’s profession—carrion promise, bruised banana, iron—while wildflower updrafts mirror internal calm. Final image charges closure: corpse bloom’s “sweet death” lulls villagers into dreams of “flying hares exhaling birds,” tying setting directly to thematic resonance. Every detail serves pressure or perception; no white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cultivating “serenity within motion”—tightens when the seed’s rot must be precise enough to fuse but not attract pollinators, forcing Myrrh to stitch blind to scent. This deepening narrows options: she breathes through her mouth to mute olfactory storm, sacrificing sensory advantage for control. Cost is felt in her journal entry (“I sway inside the sway”) and culminates in relinquishing the notebook. Agency drives escalation; coincidence never resolves—only the forest’s pulse and her mother’s silent ascent complicate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through grafting as metaphor for intergenerational wisdom: what’s hidden (doodles, seeds) feeds what’s revealed (bloom, serenity). Final image reweights prior material—the notebook wrapped in indigo paper becomes a gift to wind-spirits, echoing her mother’s custom—without stating a moral. Ambition’s transformation into gratitude avoids binary resolution; the “flying hares exhaling birds” dream fuses motion and stillness organically. Subtext thrives in silence, scent, and stitched bark—not exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exquisitely consistent: Myrrh notices via scent first (carrion promise, almond gum), then texture (spider-silk, paperbark), with syntax mimicking arboreal sway—long clauses narrowing to terse journal entries. Voice modulates under pressure: lyrical density during ascent (“planks narrowing until the bridge became a limb”) gives way to clipped, breath-held prose at grafting (“Stitch holds; seed sighs”). No head-hopping; even the mother’s appearance filters through Myrrh’s olfactory memory. Prose-as-character achieves near-symbiosis with theme.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense but pattern-taught: scent motifs (“wildflower hush,” “bruised banana”) recur with escalating stakes, never muddling causality. Sentence propulsion varies—fluid during ascent, staccato during stitching—and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats (e.g., post-graft journal entry as standalone). Zero paraphrase loops; every line multitasks (e.g., “ink made from moon-mulled violets” establishes tool, ritual, and temporality). Minor deduction for slight over-compression in tidal metaphor (“tide thinks”), but closure remains unblurred.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms herbalist tropes through olfactory specificity and grafting-as-ritual, making serenity an active, precarious practice rather than passive state. The corpse flower’s premature bloom—ten years early—subverts expectation while honoring botanical logic. Wind-spirits reframed as fellow scent-sensitive beings avoids fantasy cliché. Bold risk: prioritizing atmospheric accumulation over plot mechanics, yet every image tightens thematic stakes. Final notebook offering feels inevitable, not contrived—a fresh synthesis of gift economy and ecological reciprocity.</comment>
