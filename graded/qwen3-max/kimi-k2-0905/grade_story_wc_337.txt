<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is vividly embodied—his silence, tactile focus, and emotional restraint feel specific and consistent. His micro-choices (e.g., not trusting his voice, accelerating the needlework) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation of mask-mending for story-exhuming is earned through accumulated action, not declared. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions emerge through gesture, not exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: brokenness redefined as readiness for light. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—silence pools, knots release stories, masks shift from humming to singing. Cost is legible in Elian’s regained heartbeat and the fisherman’s radiant departure. Every beat tightens the thematic coil without causal slippage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary isn’t backdrop—it refracts starlight into war paint, hums with trapped voices, and holds its breath at dawn. The tapestry needle, fox mask, and net function as micro-settings that constrain and charge choices. Sensory detail (salt-taste sighs, phosphorescent fibers) is selective, urgent, and POV-filtered. Final image of fracture lines as “maps” ties setting to theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing silenced spirits—is signaled early and deepens through knot-untying that releases layered stories. Escalation is driven by Elian’s agency: each knot undone raises emotional density and narrows his role from restorer to exhumator. Cost is felt in the “accumulated silence” lifting only after labor. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: unsaid grief fractures vessels until stories are exhumed. The final image—broken masks as maps letting light through—offers a non-literal answer to the central question of containment vs. expression. No moralizing; resonance arises from the net’s transformation into ordinary rope and the chorus of singing masks. Ambiguity lingers (other spirits wait), but stance is clear.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature rooted in touch and silence (“fracture lines like fault lines in his own chest”). Syntax modulates with pressure—longer sentences during reflection, tighter rhythms during unraveling. No head-hopping; focalization remains tightly bound to Elian. Diction stays within his plausible lexicon—no register drift or committee voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (silence as water, knots as mouths) and pays off. Minor overwriting in “interlaced hush” repetition slightly dulls momentum, but no scaffold loops or mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s cadence crystallizes the closure without artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise transforms familiar tropes (spirit medium, artisan healer) through specific mechanics: grounding via knot-unraveling, silence as physical accumulation, masks as sonic vessels. The prism sanctuary’s rules feel internally consistent and fresh. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure, minimal dialogue) heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular, not templated.</comment>
