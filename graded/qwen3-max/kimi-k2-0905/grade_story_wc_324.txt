<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation—protecting vulnerable posthumous voices—is embodied through micro-choices (pocketing the photo, lying to Hask) that escalate under pressure. Her internal contradiction (duty vs. subterfuge) manifests physically via the hearing aid and morally via her confrontation with Hask. The final renunciation—letting the battery die—carries visible cost: relinquishing her conduit to the dead. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are filtered through professional habit and tactile detail.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira ensures Lila’s credit while Hask collapses under guilt, crystallizing a before/after where truth outweighs institutional erasure. The causal chain (“because she heard → traced → confronted”) holds under a Causal lens, with each beat narrowing options. Cost is legible in Hask’s collapse and Mira’s silent surrender of her hearing aid. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 30.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium functions as micro-setting: its vines mimic heart valves, condensation records heartbeats in rust, and spectral mist coalesces donors at climax. The hearing aid—a tool-as-setting—constrains perception and drives action. Final image (sunrise burning off mist like “a final exposure”) reweights the entire atmosphere as truth-revealing. Sensory hierarchy shifts appropriately: city static → ghostly pulses → orchid rot → sodium-orange glow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting erased voices—tightens when Mira chooses to upload the ledger over preserving evidence, forcing Hask’s reckoning. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her curiosity → tracing → confrontation → upload. Cost is unmistakable: triggering alarms, risking career, and bearing witness to Hask’s collapse. Coincidence (finding Lila’s photo) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from Mira’s decisive upload and lie.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: heroism as overheard duty, not chosen glory. The ledger and photograph reprice “incidental heroism” from bureaucratic footnote to moral imperative. Final image—sunrise fixing “a world slightly more honest”—offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence: Hask’s trembling fingers, mist-shapes of donors, and the hearing aid’s quiet discharge all resonate beyond plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Mira notices through medical/technical filters (“valves closing,” “fibrillation,” “emulsion warm”). Rhythm modulates under pressure—longer sentences for atmosphere, clipped phrases during upload/confrontation. No head-hopping; focalization stays tight. Voice remains consistent even in elevated diction (“reeling hush,” “spectral ribbons”), which feels character-earned given her profession.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “vines had learned to mimic heart valves,” “condensation had recorded heartbeats in rust.” Figurative language is pattern-taught (cardiac motifs) and payoff-earned. Minor overwriting in “orchid rot” + “chemical scent” pairing, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence (“dreamless… confident… listen”) perfectly modulates closure without purple excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise transforms “ghost story” into institutional critique via original mechanics: hearing aid as spirit medium, ledgers as battlegrounds of memory. Specificity abounds—1973 blood-drive, donor #147, Ministry bureaucracy—avoiding generic tropes. Risk-taking (dead narrators, corporate erasure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The synthesis—tracing hearts as ethical resistance—feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
