<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “mulberry ache,” trembling bow, and plant telepathy reveal a character whose contradictions (archivist vs. arsonist, verifier vs. intervener) crystallize under pressure. Her final choice feels earned through micro-decisions: setting the violin down, interpreting the coffee stain, feeling the cereus roots anchor her. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through sensory perception and physical response. The cost—personal exhaustion, irreversible historical rupture—is legible in her “tired eyes” post-climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the empire’s rule-by-conquest is reweighted by frost-seeded rebellion, with visible cost (failed harvests, toppled throne). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story builds density via recurring motifs (perforation, propagation, ice) that culminate in a decisive cadence shift when starlight cracks the dome. Orientation is immediate (“velvet observatory at midsummer”), and causality flows through Lira’s agency: each revelation (coffee stain, cereus hum) tightens stakes. The final image—orchards blooming out of season—makes the before/after undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The velvet observatory functions as micro-setting: its bruised-purple dome, potted cereus, and dais directly constrain Lira’s choice (the dome must crack for real starlight to enter). Sensory detail is selective and urgent—crushed lilac, refracted moonlight, inkblot pupils—filtered through Lira’s botanical telepathy. The ice violin’s melting state charges the final image, and spatial choreography remains coherent (roots wrap ankles on dais, saucer used for glue/stain). Environment actively shapes tactics: without the observatory’s “hinge of midsummer,” the violin’s winter cannot propagate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—weighing a dream against an empire—is signaled early and deepens when the coffee stain reveals the child-emperor’s glacial tyranny. Escalation is driven by Lira’s agency: interpreting stains, heeding the cereus, choosing to play. The moral calculus sharpens—silence preserves provenance but evaporates hope; playing unravels destiny but starves the empire. Cost is unmistakable: collapsed violin, failed harvests, her own exhaustion. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with “propagate” acting as both command and consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: perforated silk as metaphor for fragile, rewritable history; ice violins as instruments of both beauty and conquest. The ending offers a non-literal answer—orchards blooming out of season—to the central question of whether silence or song better serves justice. No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete images (frost-sealed blossoms, faded coffee stain). Complexity is embraced: Lira is both ruler and researcher, her intervention neither wholly redemptive nor destructive, but transformative with tangible cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is exquisitely controlled: Lira’s perceptual signature blends archival precision (“forged bills of sale”) with botanical synesthesia (“green gossip,” “mulberry ache”). Syntax modulates under pressure—longer, lyrical sentences early give way to taut phrasing at climax (“bow trembling like a question mark”). No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Diction stays within plausible lexicon (no academic drift), and rhythm accelerates with the violin’s first note cracking the dome. Every line serves atmosphere, character, or plot.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “bruised purple that made every footstep feel like trespass” establishes tone economically. Figurative language is pattern-taught (ice, perforation, propagation) and payoff-rich—no muddle in peak beats. Sentence openings vary (“She set…”, “The custodian…”, “Lira’s job…”), and paragraphs cut purposefully. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “lung full of ancestral cold,” but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final line (“perforated destinies rewriting themselves”) recharges the opening motif with earned resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Ingenuity abounds: provenance research fused with magical realism, coffee-stain divination as archival method, plants as political chorus. Tropes (ice queen, cursed artifact) are transformed through specific stakes—glaciers remembering, violins exhaling winter. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight: every element (cereus, saucer, inkblot pupils) contributes to closure. Bold risk-taking (silent climax resolved through botanical telepathy) heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Vision is singular—no prompt-template echoes.</comment>
