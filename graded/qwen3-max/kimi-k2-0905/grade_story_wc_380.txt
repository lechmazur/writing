<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Miren’s motivation—recovering her sister’s deleted memories—is rooted in specific, embodied history (pressed wildflowers, tide tables) and drives every action. Her internal conflict manifests not as alternating summaries but as simultaneous longing and resolve, especially when she kneels in the salt chamber. The final renunciation—accepting memories as sensation, not narrative—feels earned through tactile micro-choices (laying flowers, gathering dust). Her emotional calibration avoids therapy-speak; grief is conveyed through weight, taste, and light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with pressure intensifying through sensory density and pattern convergence (coffee spirals → salt shadow → gravity collapse). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “deleted memories do not vanish; they sink… into places where the world's rules grow thin.” Cost is legible in the crumbling flowers, spent pigment, and Miren’s unbroken but altered shadow. The whale’s disappearance and drifting memories crystallize a before/after without mechanical resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains choice: gravity pockets pull Miren into “strange arcs,” forcing physical negotiation of space to reach the memory-shadow. Light-bending crystals and ambient mist directly enable the emergence of memories, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—Miren notices weight shifts, taste of iron, petal color—filtered through her lantern-lighter profession and grief. The dock, whale carcass, and chamber form a cohesive, rule-bound ecology where world logic shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering erased memories—is signaled early and deepens through Miren’s discovery that memories return only as sensation, not narrative. The tightening occurs when the gravity point collapses: she cannot grasp the firefly-memories, accepting their ephemerality. Cost is visible in the crumbled flowers and spent pigment, altering her tactics from retrieval to dispersal. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence (whale beaching) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the ritual succeeds through her deliberate acts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: forgetting is porous, deletion is illusionary, and loss becomes ballast. The final image—Miren walking home with laughter “settled into her bones”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question (“Where do deleted memories go?”) by reweighting absence as presence. Subtext operates through gesture (folding dust into lantern sleeve) and silence (dockworkers dreaming unknowingly). No moralizing; complexity endures as memories drift unclaimed yet felt citywide.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Miren’s perceptual signature: she reads the world via light, gravity, and maritime residue. Voice modulates with pressure—lyric compression during memory emergence (“minnows… weight of a hand… smell of wet rope”) avoids purple prose. Syntax varies purposefully: short clauses for gravity shifts, flowing cadence for crystal chambers. No head-hopping; even collective dockworkers remain externalized as “ghosts,” preserving focal integrity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (e.g., “gravity fluctuated… boots sank ankle-deep without leaving a mark” conveys physics and emotion). Figurative language is pattern-taught (spirals, tides, light) and payoff-coherent. Minor overwriting in “gleaming silence” repetition (three mentions), slightly dulling closure resonance. Otherwise, rhythm varies naturally, with strong verbs (“exhaling mist,” “dragged away by currents”) avoiding scaffold or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise transforms archival erasure into tangible physics—memories sink like whale bones into thin-rule zones. Originality thrives in specific synthesis: lantern-lighter profession meets gravity anomalies meets salt-based memory preservation. Risk-taking (non-narrative memories, sentient tides) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Every element feels inevitable in hindsight; removing the whale or flowers would collapse the conceptual ecosystem. Vision coheres as singular artistic stance against state-imposed forgetting.</comment>
