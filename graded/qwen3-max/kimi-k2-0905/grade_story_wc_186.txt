<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The custodian’s retrocognition is embodied through visceral, contradictory sensations (“tasted the hour,” “pulse counting every mistake”), not diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices—tracking star paths, prying the shard from bone—reveal a hierarchy of values (meaning over safety). The final stance crystallizes as Earned Stasis: she becomes the prism, accepting solitude to sustain light. Cost is visible in the child’s skeleton and her irreversible commitment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lamp’s rose glow reweights “coincidence” into “intention,” with felt cost in the child’s death and the mother’s absence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via sensory shards, culminating in starlight stitching silence into song. Every beat tightens around the missing shard; the desert’s mute pause after retrieval intensifies pressure without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The glass humming pavilion functions as micro-setting: its corroded brass console, hollow ribs, and fractured panes directly constrain action (aligning the prism, hearing past voices). The post-collapse coast (“no clocks; only tide and star”) tightens temporal stakes, while Joshua tree and mall husks ground the journey. Final image—rose light spreading “like an apology”—charges the setting with thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving coincidences have meaning—is signaled early and deepens when the shard of hush demands bodily sacrifice (prying it from fused palms). Protagonist agency drives escalation: she walks seven nights, reads star paths, endures desert muteness. Cost is unmistakable: the child’s skeleton embodies the price of hope, and her return forecloses anonymity for eternal vigilance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through refraction imagery: shattered prisms, starlight, and retrocognition reframe “fall” as cyclical renewal. The ending offers non-literal resolution—the rose lamp isn’t warning but “thistle-blown hope”—reweighting prior silence into song without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gaps: fishermen/refugees/lovers all speak “backward,” implying meaning requires active reconstruction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: the custodian notices light as taste, sound as vibration (“moan between mourning and morning”). Rhythm modulates masterfully—long, lyrical sentences for reflection; clipped phrases during desert trek (“footprints erased by salt wind”). No head-hopping; retrocognition stays bounded by touch. Voice remains consistent even in peak stress (“pulse counting every mistake”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “fragments of skylight that had once sung with dawn” merges setting, backstory, and loss in one phrase. Figurative language is coherent (light as song, silence as fabric) and never muddled. Minor overwriting in “calcification” description, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence—short clauses building to “no fall is final”—perfectly mirrors thematic crescendo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes through specificity: retrocognition as curse tied to crystal physics, “shard of hush” as literal sound-swallowing object. The synthesis—refraction as metaphor for meaning-making—feels inevitable yet fresh. Bold risk: making silence the antagonist, resolved not by noise but by precise alignment. Vision coheres fully; no hedging in the rose lamp’s fragile, non-utilitarian hope.</comment>
