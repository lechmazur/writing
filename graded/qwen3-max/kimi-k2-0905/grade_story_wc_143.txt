<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inspector’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her grief, curiosity, and resolve interwoven through tactile details like the grandmother’s tooth-marked focus ring and the cracking voice in field notes. Her motivation (documenting extinction) intensifies under pressure, culminating in a renunciation of hope that forecloses intervention but affirms witnessing as resistance. The micro-choice to fire the shutter three times—not once—reveals her hierarchy of values with palpable cost: memory over utility, presence over survival. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through action, not summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final fossil imprint and crimson-timed photograph crystallize irreversible loss while reconfiguring witnessing into defiance. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—density builds via sensory layering (phosphorescence, electrostatic wind, chemical blush) until the cadence shift at “she fired the shutter once, twice, three times” tightens stakes. Cost is legible in the buried half-grain’s rose flush and expired contract. Orientation anchors instantly (“crater inspector,” “Mount Selene,” “Earthrise”) and never wavers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The lunar summit functions as micro-setting: vitrified regolith constrains movement, feldspar veins anchor the anemones’ location, and Earth’s blue glow dictates photographic exposure. Every detail serves pressure—the terminator wind triggers blooming, UV bleaching sets the deadline—and charges the final image where Earth hovers above ghost flowers. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: phosphorescence over silence, electrostatic whispers over vacuum. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains precise even during meteor streaks.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capturing the last bloom before extinction—is signaled early and deepens when the inspector realizes no seed bank or political will exists. Her agency manifests through attention (framing Earth above anemones) and endurance (waiting past tremor), narrowing options until only witnessing remains. The forty-three-minute timer forces trade-offs: water rationed for reaction, contract expiration ignored. Cost is unmistakable: the pink blush beneath basalt confirms irreversible closure, and her voice cracks acknowledging abandoned terraforming dreams.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the hourglass grain embodies stolen time, anemones symbolize undocumented fragility, and the antique camera ties generational witness to technological obsolescence. The ending offers a non-literal answer—photography as resistance against cosmic indifference—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence: the meteor’s scratch echoes the moon’s molten past cradling life, reframing extinction as intimate rather than statistical. Ambiguity lingers (Will the film survive? Who will see it?), but emotional honesty avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: the inspector notices geological textures (vitrified regolith, feldspar veins) and temporal markers (hourglass sand, terminator wind) through a scientist’s lens tinged with elegiac longing. Rhythmic control under pressure shines in staccato shutter clicks versus lyrical anemone unfurling. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained (she doesn’t know Europa’s fate, only hears rumors). Diction stays within plausible lexicon—“bioluminescent regret” feels earned, not academic—and compression (e.g., “neural backups were expensive”) trusts reader inference.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density: “glassy petals already trembling with anticipatory phosphorescence” conveys biology, light, and tension in one phrase. Sentence openings vary (“She carried,” “Purposefully curious,” “A meteor scratched”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats (field notes interruption). Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors cohere (sand as time, anemones as letters). Minor overwriting in “bioluminescent regret” slightly strains credibility, but closure remains undulled—final lines (“no margin”) land with stark propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms lunar exploration tropes by centering extinction documentation over discovery, using chemical timers instead of tech, and framing Earth as mournful witness. Specificity abounds: Tycho station’s abandoned hourglass, feldspar-vein anemones, 43-minute UV window—all feel irreproducible. The synthesis of geology, photography, and chronochemistry creates inevitability: this story couldn’t exist elsewhere. Bold risk in lyric accumulation pays off; melancholy never veers into cliché because stakes remain tactile (water bead, hip flask, film grain).</comment>
