<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marrow’s interiority is vividly embodied—her caution, grief, and duty manifest through tactile choices (pressing palms to ice, handling the globe) rather than exposition. Her trait of weaving truth carefully directly shapes her actions and the story’s resolution. The final smile carries earned emotional weight after sustained restraint. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions (duty vs. self-preservation) simmer beneath every beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the glacier’s swallowed sorrow is reframed as cradled light, with cost legible in dissolving passengers and sealed windows. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—dream fragments accrue into a planetarium of collective memory, culminating in the shrine’s revelation. Every shard (wreck dive, dream, shrine, heart-chamber) coheres under this logic. The final footprints filling with meltwater crystallize Charged Poise: future rescue is possible because wreckage held purity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The glacier functions as both setting and sentient crucible—its groans, crevasses, and air-pocket corridors constrain Marrow’s movement and shape her tactics. The candle-lit shrine isn’t backdrop; its cold-burning candles enable vision into dream-windows, directly advancing the plot. Final image charges the snow globe as micro-setting that mirrors and reconfigures the entire journey. Sensory specificity (crevasse-blue ice, rime-stiff formalwear) serves pressure, never stalls it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—salvaging “something pure”—tightens when Marrow realizes cameo faces are threads in a tapestry, raising the cost from retrieval to translation. Her agency drives escalation: three nights in the shrine, pressing palms until skin sticks, following jellyfish-memories deeper. The glacier’s silence forces her to interpret, not command, making the final hymn a hard-won reciprocity. Cost is felt in passengers dissolving into glitter—a visible forfeiture for the knowledge gained.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the snow globe’s transformation: wreckage can cradle light. No moralizing—insight arises from Marrow seeing her future self teaching another diver, proving memory’s transmission is the pure thing. Subtext thrives in gestures (leaving the mirror, unguarded smile) and images (meltwater reflecting future, not past). The central question—can loss be salvaged without breaking it?—is answered non-literally by the globe’s intact core within unfrozen water.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is exquisitely controlled: lyrical but precise, with rhythm modulating from submerged dread (“whispering through the ice”) to transcendent clarity (“hymn that tasted like salt and forgiveness”). Perceptual signature is distinct—Marrow notices thermal details, glass warping, candle physics—filtered through her diver-ghost-whisperer lexicon. No head-hopping; single POV remains taut even amid dream-shards. Final paragraph’s cadence (“footprints filling with meltwater…”) recharges opening motifs without echo.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence layers atmosphere, character, and plot (“glass warped into teardrops, miniature cities inside collapsed into slag”). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (glacier as whale, memories as jellyfish). Figurative language intensifies at climax without muddle—the planetarium of sorrow, diamond of fused ink. Minor deduction only for slight over-compression in the corridor sequence, where momentum briefly outruns spatial clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms ghost/diver tropes via the “windows of connection” conceit—cameo dreamers aren’t cameos but connective tissue in a collective unconscious. Originality lies in the glacier as archive and the snow globe as recursive vessel (shrine within globe within story). Risk-taking (lyric mosaic, sentient ice) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The synthesis—drowned passengers singing forgiveness as Marrow surfaces—feels inevitable yet astonishing.</comment>
