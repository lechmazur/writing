<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The tattooist’s guilt is embodied through tactile details—the static in her chest, the burning constellation—and her final choice to release rather than erase feels earned by layered micro-decisions. Her contradictory impulses (to silence vs. restore) act simultaneously during the climax, and the cost—sacrificing potential absolution for collective peace—is viscerally rendered. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through action (slicing the chain, inking a mute star). The amber and stylus function as extensions of her psyche, not props.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she renounces control over the lullaby, accepting that guilt cannot be erased but may be hushed. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds via sensory density (fluttering letters, dissolving amber) until the final reconfiguration. Cost is legible in the empty amber and quiet collarbone. Time folding isn’t gimmickry; it tightens causality by collapsing past/present into one resonant beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The laboratory functions as micro-setting: its drawers, console, and glass chambers actively constrain choice (e.g., menu options, paper chains). Sensory hierarchy shifts under stress—early visual silk-ripples give way to tactile gold filaments and olfactory nursery pine at closure. The body (collarbone constellation) and tool (brass stylus) are setting-adjacent, charging the final image. Every detail serves pressure or payoff; no white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—hushing guilt through sonic restoration—is signaled by line 3 and deepens when the lab reveals it cultivates, not stores, lost sounds. Protagonist agency drives escalation: tethering amber triggers the cry; selecting RESTORE unleashes the chorus; slicing the chain enables RELEASE. Cost is unmistakable: she trades personal resolution for communal peace, foreclosing the path to self-forgiveness. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between preservation and release: constellations as both wounds and lullabies. The final image—empty amber, quiet collarbone—offers a non-literal answer: forgiveness isn’t erasure but surrender to incompleteness. No moralizing; subtext lives in the mute star she inks and the backward-turned mobile. Recurring motifs (amber, static, meteors) accrue meaning without redundancy, resisting tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: the tattooist notices ink, star-maps, and sonic textures first. Syntax modulates with pressure—long, rippling sentences early fracture into terse commands (“RELEASE INSECT”) at climax. Voice remains consistent despite lyrical density; no head-hopping or register drift. Elision (e.g., meteor hush as unexplained phenomenon) is taught early and pays off in the final quietude.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“static,” “black silk,” “haunted firmware”) and coheres without muddle. Minor overwriting in the hologram description (“tonal ache... parsed as ‘Why did you leave me awake?’”) slightly blurs cause/effect, but closure remains lucid. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies organically.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Transforms tropes (tattooist-as-healer, haunted labs) through specific synthesis: guilt as static, firmware as emotional architecture. The risk—lyric abstraction in a causal market—heightens stakes by making the lab’s rules feel discovered, not imposed. Every element (amber, stylus, meteor hush) is irreplaceable; removing any collapses the logic. Feels inevitable in hindsight yet wholly fresh.</comment>
