<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The carver’s interiority is richly embodied—her grief manifests through tactile attention to ribbon, chisels, and stone. Her “fiercely meditative” nature drives micro-choices (e.g., tracing poem-titles on headstones) that reveal a hierarchy of values: honoring the unsaid over naming loss directly. The final renunciation—shifting from carving memorials to cultivating transformation gardens—is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany rather than struggle, softening the flaw-complication dynamic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: grief isn’t stone to be carved but transformation to undergo. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via poetic fragments, butterfly wings, and chrysalis imagery until the final image reweights all prior material. Cost is legible in the carver’s realization that each traded poem was “a small death.” The greenhouse’s spatial logic remains coherent, and the single-scene structure fits 600–800 words perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: its glass panes, potting benches, and central oak tree channel the carver’s movement and discovery. Weather (“thundering calm,” storm shadows) mirrors internal states without cliché. Crucially, the setting charges the final image—the oak’s roots cradling unplaced headstones—and the woven ribbon’s warmth emerges from this environment. Every detail serves pressure or closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding collective grief—is signaled early and deepens when the carver realizes poems are “chisel strokes against the stone of sorrow.” Escalation occurs through her agency: following butterflies, touching headstones, sitting among them to absorb weight. The cost is unmistakable: she must abandon her craft’s traditional purpose. Under the Accumulative lens, this deepening reweights the entire village’s method of mourning, though the tightening lacks a concrete tactical shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of carving, poetry, and metamorphosis—grief as living process, not static memorial. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: memorials must be lived, not carved. Poetic fragments (“Hope is the thing with feathers”) accrue subtext without moralizing. The carver’s arc is inseparable from the thematic question, and ambiguity lingers (e.g., unnamed griefs) without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure (e.g., short clauses during chrysalis formation). Perceptual signature is strong—she notices patterns in wings, textures of terracotta, glints of poetry on butterfly scales. POV remains stable; grandmother’s voice emerges through wingbeats, not head-hopping. Minor register drift in “thundering calm” borders on elevated diction but stays within character lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“glass panes rattled with thundering calm” conveys sound, mood, and weather). Figurative language is pattern-taught (butterflies = poetry = grief) and pays off at closure. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though “thundering calm” repeats once without deepening. Sentence variety supports rhythm, and the final paragraph’s propulsion matches thematic resolution. One near-mixed metaphor (“living tomb”) risks coherence but lands due to context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of gravestone carving, monarch migration, and poetic exchange feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (spectral mentor, ancestral object) are transformed through specific mechanics: grief processed via Dickinson/Neruda call-and-response, memorials as poem-titled headstones. The risk of lyric abstraction is offset by concrete stakes (unplaced stones, warm ribbon). Vision coheres singularly—no prompt-safety hedging—and the final image of butterfly-guided gardens offers fresh inflection.</comment>
