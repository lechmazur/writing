<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sister Halcyon’s interiority is vividly embodied—her gravitational lightness, stitching as vow, and fusion of sorrow with joy feel character-specific, not archetypal. Her pacifism isn’t passive; it actively shapes tactics (stitching the sail, choosing mercy as mirror). The final renunciation—staying to tend redeemed shadows—is earned by her consistent refusal to abandon grief. No diagnostic label-speak; even “shadow work” is dramatized through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Earned Stasis crystallized in Sister Halcyon’s choice to remain, foreclosing return with visible cost (abandoning the ship-as-vessel for ship-as-seed). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via photographs, hair-thread, Tear—culminating in the sail’s auroral release. Cost is legible: ten billion deaths weighed against fragile, defiant joy. Orientation anchors instantly (“recycled spaceship,” “last pacifist”), and causality flows through emotional gravity, not physics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: hull plates sing when lightened, the engine shrine houses the emotion-tuned spinner, and derelict photographs are literal resources. Final image—vines of light blooming from hull—charges closure by transforming coffin into seed. Sensory detail is selective (bare feet on deck, glassy jade warmth) and filtered through Halcyon’s tactile reverence. No white-room syndrome; every bolt and photograph carries history.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—opening the locked dimension via joy heavy enough to counterbalance extinction—is signaled early and deepens when holograms warn “it may be mirror.” The meaningful tightening occurs at the sail’s completion: joy must now carry all grief, not evade it. Protagonist agency drives escalation—she chooses to fuse sorrow with joy, enabling passage. Cost is unmistakable: she trades mobility for eternal tending, vacuum tugging at her heels as she stays.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: human extinction wasn’t failure but metamorphosis into “a quiet lantern.” Central question—can collective grief be redeemed?—is answered non-literally in the auditorium where photographs become living moments. Subtext thrives in silence (holograms’ warnings), gesture (palm over Tear), and image (upward rain watering light-vines). Avoids moralizing; “mercy is the mirror I choose” feels earned, not preachy, because it precedes action, not follows it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exquisite: Halcyon notices “faint shimmer of long-dried tears,” hears hull plates “singing,” sees space bruises. Rhythmic control under pressure—short clauses during stitching (“each knot a vow”), lyrical flow at climax (“slipped through the bruise like a needle through silk”). No head-hopping; single POV maintained with poetic compression that’s taught early (“gravitationally lighter when happy”) and paid off. Voice modulates from lullaby hum to starlight-steady resolve without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “hull stitched together from the ribs of a dozen dead cruisers” does worldbuilding, character, and atmosphere in one stroke. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances. Figurative language is coherent (ship as coffin/seed, Tear as green eye) and peaks without muddle. Minor deduction only because “ghostly resolve” in final line slightly echoes prompt—but integration justifies it. Read-aloud rhythm varies masterfully, from staccato welds to flowing auroras.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-extinction pacifism as cosmic repair, grief as material for sails, happiness as anti-gravity. Tropes (Kwan Yin, cloning crèche) transformed through specificity—embryo grown among taped photos, Tear fused with personal sorrow. Bold risk: stakes hinge on emotional weight, not violence, and closure rewards endurance, not triumph. Feels inevitable in hindsight: every element (hair-thread, spinner, photographs) converges to make the locked dimension yield to stitched mercy.</comment>
