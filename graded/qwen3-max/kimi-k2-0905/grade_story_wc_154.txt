<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The translator’s interiority is richly embodied—cordite on the tongue, coral in the pocket—and his micro-choices (deciphering the cast, voicing symbols) reveal a hierarchy of guilt, duty, and fragile hope. The boy’s shrewd innocence forces a reckoning that feels earned, not sentimental. Motivation flows from consistent trauma without diagnostic self-awareness. Final renunciation (“I stayed”) carries visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the world shrinks to cot/coral/child, then expands via dew-laden lotus petals—a reweighting of shared trauma into fragile peace. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: smudged glyphs, droplets, spiral motifs intensify toward a cadence shift where ink dilutes into palimpsest. Cost is legible in the sternum ache transformed, not erased.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium functions as micro-setting: glass roof condenses twilight into syllabic droplets that pressure perception and time. Coral fragment and plaster cast constrain choice—both are handled, aligned, and reweighted at closure. Sensory detail (banana leaves, morphine fog, salted ink) is filtered through crisis-narrowed attention. Final image of coral “growing from the sea itself” charges the environment with thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—grafting meaning onto wounds—is signaled early and deepens when the cast reveals the translator’s birthday and village massacre. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to voice each symbol, transforming confession into shared ritual. Cost is unmistakable: the pulse-stuttering memory cannot be dulled, yet he stays. Pressure tightens coherently under Accumulative lens until stakes crystallize in Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from coral-whorls mirroring “gyres of shared anxieties” and ink dissolving into tide lines—no moralizing. The final image reweights trauma as sediment for growth, answering the central question (Can wounds hold new meaning?) non-literally. Subtext lives in braille-like ridges, tapped coral, unknotted words. Ambiguity lingers (Will the boy heal? Will the translator survive the buffer zone?), but resonance is undeniable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is singular, lyric, and perceptually precise: anesthetic hums “like distant shelling,” anxieties are “invisible shrapnel.” Syntax modulates with pressure—long, fluid sentences fracture into breath-fogged immediacy near the cot. Diction stays within translator’s lexicon; no register drift. Focalization remains tight, with coastal dialect used purposefully to deepen intimacy, not exoticize.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense with multi-tasking imagery (“shrapnel-eyed and shrewdly innocent,” “lotus-hearted, petal-soft yet root-deep”), but avoids overwriting through rhythmic control. Minor figurative density in peak beats (e.g., “coral cups,” “tide lines”) serves pattern payoff. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Final line’s “quiet percussion of peace still possible” earns its lyricism through accumulated texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of war trauma, translation ethics, and ecological memory via brain coral as vessel for collective guilt. Tropes (wounded child, haunted translator) are grounded in specific, irreplaceable details: smudged coordinates, reef-shelling backstory, coastal dialect. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure, conceptual repricing of shrapnel as sediment) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels authentically singular, not prompt-derived.</comment>
