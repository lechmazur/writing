<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mender’s interiority is vividly embodied—her cracked goggles, feisty curses, and tactile rituals reveal a psyche shaped by betrayal and devotion. Her micro-choices (using the ribbon as pendulum, grafting with copper gear) align precisely with her generational burden and emotional stakes. The daughter’s appearance crystallizes relational pressure without sentimentality, and the final wisdom feels earned through struggle, not epiphany. Flaws like stubbornness and grief actively complicate her tactics, making her endurance feel costly and credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the orchard decides when to forgive, foreclosing institutional reconciliation with visible cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through layered imagery (vows as leaves, fruit as apology) until the final graft reweights the entire premise. Every beat tightens around the central breach, and the decisive act (tying ribbon to beam) emerges organically from established lore. Cost is legible in the elders’ barred entry and the mender’s solitary vigil beneath the wound.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard functions as a dynamic micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: roots coil around corbels, figs split into scrolls, rafters become tracery. Sensory detail is purposeful—sunlight stripes “aisles of air and bark,” sap hisses on copper—and filtered through the mender’s quartz-eye perception. The absent rose window and toppled pews aren’t backdrop but active residues of abandonment that shape her ritual. Most crucially, the setting charges the final image: coconut-copper fragrance drifting over the city embodies the covenant’s transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keeping the orchard alive despite breached contract—is signaled immediately and deepens when the mender opens the forbidden pouch, narrowing her options to ancestral methods. Pressure escalates coherently under Accumulative lens: each object used (ribbon, gear, pollen) raises emotional and symbolic stakes. The cost is unmistakable—she sacrifices institutional validation for organic justice, sleeping beneath the graft while elders wait outside. Agency drives every turn; coincidence never resolves, only complicates (wind shifting, fig dropping).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through concrete particulars: vows as compost, fruit feeding on apology, promises as leaves that must fall. The final image—rotted ribbon absorbed into bark, releasing coconut-copper fragrance—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: broken contracts can photosynthesize into hope through persistent, humble repair. No moralizing; wisdom arises from cambium thrumming beneath silk and copper. Complexity is preserved—forgiveness is deferred, not granted—and ambiguity lingers in the orchard’s sovereign judgment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is exquisitely controlled: rhythmic, dense yet precise, with a perceptual signature rooted in the mender’s quartz-goggled, botanically attuned worldview (“time persisting like sap in winter”). Syntax modulates under pressure—shorter clauses during grafting, lyrical flow in reflection—without losing texture. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Figurative language is consistent and legible (“deciduous vows,” “green applause”), and the prose-as-character principle holds: every sentence reflects her feisty, reverent, wounded consciousness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is masterful: high information density, zero paraphrase loops, and syntactic variety that mirrors emotional cadence. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful—no mixed metaphors or register drift. Key lines (“fruit feeds on apology,” “promises are leaves”) earn their lyricism through prior grounding. Minor deduction only because a few high-pressure beats verge on ornate (“infant leaves unfurling like green applause”), though never at the cost of clarity or propulsion. Final line perfectly recharges the opening’s “deciduous vows” with earned resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>A stunning synthesis: cathedral as ecosystem, contract breach as ecological rupture, mending as botanical-theological ritual. Every trope (guild, heirloom objects, sacred grove) is transformed through specific, lived-in detail—coconut oil on ribbon, silver pollen in ampoule, quartz monocle flashing at dawn. The core premise feels inevitable in hindsight yet wholly fresh, with bold risks (orchard as judge, vows as compost) heightening thematic stakes without gimmickry. Vision is singular, cohesive, and deeply human—no template echoes, only original mythmaking rooted in maternal legacy and urban decay.</comment>
