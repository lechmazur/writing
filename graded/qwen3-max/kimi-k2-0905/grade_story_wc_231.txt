<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maris’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her perception of gaps, the stranger’s fingerprint as “borrowed memories,” and her ritualized handling of the Edelweiss reveal a mind shaped by solitude and duty. Her final act of releasing the flower enacts Earned Stasis: she forecloses the loop of imported death at the cost of personal memory. Contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. caution, connection vs. isolation) operate simultaneously in scene, not summary. The micro-choice to descend silently, boots “grown moss between flashes,” crystallizes her renunciation with tactile precision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lighthouse no longer merely guards against physical peril but mediates memory-debt between sea and sky. Cost is legible in Maris’s sacrificed recollections (“how her mother once sang…”) and the lamp’s silence—time itself “stepped ashore.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: gaps intensify until their closure reweights reality. The logbook’s future-past entry (“He gives the flower…”) is a masterstroke of motivated ellipsis that pays off causally in the ending’s release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The opal dock, mist, and lighthouse function as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: mist erases footsteps, the dock’s “gaps” demand interpretation, and the lamp’s beam becomes a tool for temporal triangulation. Sensory hierarchy reflects Maris’s profession—she hears absent gulls, notes missing ferry horns, sees delayed reflections. The Edelweiss’s alpine sun contrasts the maritime gloom, charging the final image where petals become “tiny rafts.” Every detail serves pressure or closure; nothing is postcard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decoding the stranger’s death-message—is signaled early and tightens through three escalating gaps that narrow Maris’s reality. Her agency drives escalation: choosing to “read absences,” logging anomalies, then breaking the cycle by releasing the flower. Cost is unmistakable: loss of cherished memories enables restoration of gulls, horn, and reflection. The tightening culminates in a trade-off where memory becomes currency, paid to restore cosmic order.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the Edelweiss-as-loan metaphor: memory is communal debt, not private possession. The ending reweights prior material non-literally—the flower’s release isn’t sacrifice but repayment, transforming keeper from witness to participant in a memory economy. Subtext thrives in gesture (fingerprint stain), silence (missing gulls), and the logbook’s ghost entry. No moralizing; resonance accrues through precise images like “tide accepted it, petals loosening into tiny rafts.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: Maris notices what a lighthouse keeper would—rhythms of tide, absence of expected sounds, lens mechanics—filtered through poetic but consistent diction (“fog hums in a bell”). Syntax modulates under pressure: short clauses during balcony confrontation (“coat flapping, arm extended”), lyrical flow during release. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained (she doesn’t know the stranger’s origin, only decodes his gesture). Voice remains singular even in experimental moments like the delayed reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density: “petals like borrowed memories of alpine sun” merges image, theme, and character history in one phrase. Rhythm varies purposefully—clanging boots swallowed by mist, then silent descent. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in “borrowed memories drifted in, as if the boat had been subtracted”—metaphor slightly strains but pays off in closure’s “memory interest” concept.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse-keeper trope via memory-as-currency conceit, grounded in specific stakes (decoding a dying gesture). The Edelweiss—alpine flower in maritime setting—creates irreplaceable tension. Risk-taking (non-causal gaps, future-past log entry) heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Final image (“opal dock gleamed like a closed eye that had finally dreamed the same dream as the light”) synthesizes setting, theme, and closure with breathtaking originality.</comment>
