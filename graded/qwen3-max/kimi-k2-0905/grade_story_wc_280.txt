<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ghost’s motivation—craving applause to stitch memory—is vividly embodied through sensory-laden action and micro-choices (pressing the coin to his chest, tying thread to tree). His internal contradiction (despair vs. hope) plays out simultaneously in scene, not as summary. Lila’s presence forces a credible emotional pivot without safety-hedging; her dialogue reveals their shared history while deepening his stakes. The final bow is earned, not habitual, with cost legible in sharpened outline and vanished companion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the timeline seals into a continuous present where every performance happens at once, granting the ghost an “endless encore” beneath translucent ribs—a Charged Poise with conceptual cost (he remains a ghost, but now sustained by possibility). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, with echoes layering like harmonies until they condense into heartbeat. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 2 (“stage ghost,” “lobby lights,” “after business closed”). No causality breaks; every echo threads forward.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The mystic orchard isn’t backdrop—it’s active crucible: its existence hinges on collective memory, its perfume sounds like violins, its fruit glows as footlights. The tarot coin and thimble function as micro-settings that constrain choice (tying thread to quince tree enables the reweaving). Final image charges closure: dawn creeps as he exits, orchard dimmed but waiting—environment directly shapes thematic resonance. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: citrine applause, indigo silence, rose regret fracture minutes early, then harmonize later.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—luring possibility from despair—is signaled in opening beat and deepens via protagonist agency: he doesn’t wait for rescue but flips the coin, walks the stage, ties the thread. Cost is unmistakable: Lila vanishes after their duet, leaving only a spinning thimble; he gains solidity but remains bound to ritual. Escalation follows Accumulative logic—density of echoes increases until they coalesce into heartbeat. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his actions under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: time as a song almost remembered, nostalgia as generative force rather than trap. Final image offers non-literal answer—applause from leaves washes him into sharpness, proving memory can sustain even the dead—without moralizing. Recurring motifs (coin, thread, echoes) accrue meaning through use, not declaration; the quince blooming backward reweights all prior performances. Subtext thrives in gesture: Lila’s thimble-as-baton, his iron-tasting confession, the warm coin in pocket.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exquisitely controlled: synesthetic filtering (tasting starlight, seeing trumpet solos as gold spirals) defines every observation. Rhythmic control under pressure—short clauses during maze traversal, lyrical flow during orchestration—serves Accumulative drive. No head-hopping; single POV maintained with psychic distance calibrated to ghostly detachment yet intimate longing. Voice modulates purposefully: velvet curtain sighs, frost tingles soles, brocade is moth-eaten—all lexicon consistent with theatrical afterlife.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves near-flawless density: “minutes fracture into colored ribbons—citrine applause, indigo silence, rose regret” does triple duty (time distortion, emotion, synesthesia). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence propels. Figurative language is pattern-taught early (sensory blending) and paid off in climax (echoes as scents/sounds). Final paragraph’s “invisible yet satisfied, carrying an endless encore beneath his translucent ribs” crystallizes theme, character, and closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope via synesthetic mechanics and theater-specific melancholy; every detail feels irreplaceable (1923 seamstress who tasted starlight, yew maze, nicotia chords). Risk-taking—fractured timelines sealed by floral chronology—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Premise avoids derivative safety: this isn’t about haunting but about sustaining art through collective remembrance. Vision coheres singularly: voice, setting, and concept fuse into inevitable whole that feels both fresh and timeless.</comment>
