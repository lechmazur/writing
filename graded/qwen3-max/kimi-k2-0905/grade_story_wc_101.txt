<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her exile, political past, and maternal protectiveness converge in micro-choices like hiding the bell’s clapper or prioritizing frequency over volume in food runs. Her contradictions (public silence vs. private declaration, endurance vs. planning exodus) operate simultaneously without diagnostic label-speak. The boy and Lita apply immediate pressure that sharpens her stakes, and her final act of silent ringing crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible cost: memory as sustenance under erasure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bell’s silent vibration reconfigures the network’s survival into a legible covenant, with cost felt in rationed rice, detained mothers, and incomplete spirals of pebbles. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each parcel, pebble, and whispered name layers density until the final image reweights all prior acts. Orientation anchors are clear by line 3; causality remains intact through anonymous donations, midnight runs, and intergenerational ledger logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor functions as micro-setting: its cracked dome pressures choice (rendezvous point), supplies resources (donation drop), and charges the final image (open mouth that forgot speech). Sensory detail is selective—dried-blood flakes, forbidden candles, wild sage scent—and filtered through Mara’s urgency. The bell itself acts as embodied setting, its engraving a tactile map that constrains revelation. Every spatial move tracks coherently from ridge to settlement and back.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—intergenerational continuity under sanctions—is signaled early and tightens when baby formula appears, forcing higher risk. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses frequency over volume, initiates the second ledger, and places the final pebble to inch toward exodus. Cost is unmistakable: memories will be “rationed,” elders and orphans must be woven into “a single rope of years.” Pressure accumulates texturally but coherently under sanctions’ tightening grip.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: silence as resistance, memory as contraband, care as coded logistics. The bell’s silent ring offers a non-literal answer—networked endurance outweighs individual survival—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gestures (pebbles for presence, muffled clapper for secrecy) and avoids binaries; the regime is present only through absence and consequence. Final image reweights all prior acts: breathing behind shutters becomes collective defiance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose carries a distinct perceptual signature—Mara notices what matters under duress (wheels as cover noise, moonlight-striping on hunger-thin faces). Syntax modulates with pressure: short clauses during delivery, lyrical cadence at the ridge. No head-hopping; focalization stays tightly bound to Mara’s knowledge. Voice remains consistent even in elevated moments (“amplified quiet”) because diction aligns with her former councilor lexicon and current exile pragmatism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density: “wheels disguised as ordinary vendor noise” compresses surveillance, subterfuge, and sound design in one phrase. Figurative language is purposeful (“dawn bruised the horizon,” “scent rising like unbanned prayer”) without muddle. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in “intergenerational support coded as food lists”—a rare abstract phrase amid otherwise concrete prose. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm varies naturally across beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms familiar tropes (resistance networks, symbolic bells) through grounded specificity: sanctions-era logistics, mathematical ledger-keeping, lamb’s wool muffling. The synthesis of food distribution, naming ritual, and cartography via bell engraving feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk in making silence the central action—and it pays off in the final resonant image. No derivative echoes; vision feels singular and politically precise without didacticism.</comment>
