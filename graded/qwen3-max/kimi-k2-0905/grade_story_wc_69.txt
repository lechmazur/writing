<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her grief, rage, and resolve manifest through tactile choices (humming into the rosette, pressing her ear to its rim) rather than diagnostic labels. Her “expectantly resigned” stance isn’t passive but a calibrated endurance that forecloses vocal expression with visible cost: she sacrifices her voice to restore harmony. The final renunciation—never singing aloud again—is earned by prior causality and deepens the theme of subtraction as generative. No emotional summarizing; contradiction thrums in every gesture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly: sensory density (cedar, saffron, moth-wing syllables) intensifies until the rosette’s collapse crystallizes change. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—“enemy” becomes a dissonant note—with undeniable social cost (decades of silenced lullabies returning). The “unbinding of the ear” timeframe tightens pressure, and Mara’s final act (singing the scale) directly reconfigures the city’s sonic fabric. Every beat accrues toward the dust-circle epiphany, where silence itself becomes legacy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The velvet library isn’t backdrop but active crucible: crimson drapes absorb sound, mahogany tables scarred by ink anchor history, and moonlit stained glass depicts interlaced hands—all constraining Mara’s ritual. The zither rosette functions as micro-setting, its mulberry wood and lattice dictating how sound is subtracted. Autumn’s decay (last leaf to first frost) pressures her timeline, while banned lullaby scents (saffron, iron) charge the air with political stakes. Final image—the untouched dust circle—proves setting’s causal role in closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlearning hatred through sonic subtraction—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: Mara collects syllables, then sacrifices her voice. The tightening is visceral: without a root tone, harmony fractures, forcing her ultimate trade-off. Cost is unmistakable—her permanent silence—and reweights the city’s auditory landscape. Coincidence never resolves; every shift stems from her methodical listening under the “unbinding” clock.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through particulars: the rosette’s lattice, moth-wing syllables, and crumbled mulberry wood embody “vanishing arts” as active practice, not abstraction. The ending reweights “harmony” as subtraction, not addition—a non-literal answer to how cities heal. No moralizing; resonance lives in children humming “traveled stillness” where enemies once marched. Complexity endures: hatred isn’t erased but rendered tonally irrelevant, a quiet revolution felt in breath, not banners.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>POV is single, immersive, and perceptually precise—Mara notices only what her grief-attuned senses allow (scents before sights, vibrations before voices). Syntax mirrors her method: short hums (“minor third”) yield to elongated cadences as silence deepens. Voice modulates under pressure—clinical terms like “frequencies” give way to embodied metaphors (“velvet turned inside out”). Zero head-hopping; even collective outcomes (“neighbors wake hearing tenderness”) filter through her sacrificial act.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves near-flawless density: “books loosened their spines, releasing scents of saffron, iron, and river water” conveys banned lullabies in one sensory stroke. Rhythm varies masterfully—staccato beats (“Seventeen syllables”) contrast with flowing clauses during the scale-singing. Zero paraphrase loops; every image advances plot or theme. Only hairline slip: “traveled stillness” slightly overused, but its recurrence charges the final humming line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms “choir teacher saves city” trope through radical specificity: harmony as noise-subtraction, silence as civic infrastructure. The rosette’s mechanics (reflecting stripped notes) feel freshly invented yet inevitable. Risk-taking abounds—no dialogue, no villains, climax as acoustic physics—but clarity never falters. Final image (dust circle + children’s humming) synthesizes all elements into an original mythos for post-conflict healing.</comment>
