<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mila’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her fear of sealing amnesia by eating the bread, her “heuristically gentle” handling, and tears salting ordinary crust reveal layered contradictions without diagnostic self-awareness. Her micro-choices (carrying vs. consuming, planting vs. preserving) consistently reflect a hierarchy of values rooted in reverence for memory. The gardener remains enigmatic yet functionally pressuring, never diluting focus. Final renunciation—accepting continuity over return—is earned through tactile, ritualized action with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly: each guerrilla garden deepens the pattern until mosaics brighten and storefronts reopen. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Mila’s shift from noticer to gardener crystallizes options with conceptual cost (absolution must be cultivated, not granted). The loaf’s transformation from relic to seed anchors causality without linear plot; every beat tightens the thematic weave. Cost is legible in “tears salting the crust” and benches where strangers now rest—proof memory took root.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting functions as active crucible: flour ghosts, narrowing alleys, and mosaic gods constrain choices and charge closure. The palace courtyard evolves from ruin to sanctuary, its camellias sheltering confessions that fuel resistance. Bread-born herbs spelling shop names via basil and marjoram fuse environment with theme. Final image—Mila brewing tea among ruins that “refuse to forget”—proves setting isn’t backdrop but co-agent of resurrection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving memory against creeping normality—is signaled early and escalates through Mila’s agency: she chooses not to eat, then plants, then becomes gardener. Each guerrilla act narrows options (commuters step around shoots but linger), raising emotional stakes. Cost is unmistakable: tenuous absolution requires constant tending, and reopening demands vulnerability (“bell rang like a confession”). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete particulars—no moralizing. Bread as “daily resurrection,” absolution as thyme between cobblestones, crusts as name tags—these images reweight “sacred” and “ordinary” without abstraction. Final insight (“sacred had not returned but revealed itself as continuous”) reframes the entire narrative as cultivation, not recovery. Subtext thrives in silence: tea-steam sighs, uncut loaves, curled remodeling signs—all resist tidy binaries while honoring loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: Mila notices “flour ghosts,” “vines parting,” and “crust like name tags”—all filtered through her trade as noticer. Syntax modulates with pressure: lyrical density during planting (“sliced the sanctified loaf... whispered street names”) yields to sparse clarity at dawn (“fresh rolls, normal ones”). No head-hopping; gardener’s dialogue (“Guilt rises like yeast; plant it”) feels mythic yet grounded. Voice remains consistent even in elevated moments—“heuristically gentle” recurs as rhythmic anchor, never jarring.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “commuters stepped around them without seeing, yet their eyes lingered a fraction longer” compresses societal amnesia into one breath. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“breadcrust armor,” “tea steam rise inside her”) and payoff-perfect. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary organically. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in middle (“seven pieces... fourth site”), but closure lines (“every ordinary doorway possible altar”) achieve flawless resonance without artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms urban erasure tropes through hyper-specific ritual: guerrilla gardening with sacred bread, absolution as fermentation. Core premise feels inevitable in hindsight—memory must be composted to regrow. Risks lyric ambiguity but earns it via concrete stakes (vanished bakery, curling signs). Vision coheres singularly: Mila’s soil-under-nails evolution mirrors the city’s uncloaking. No safety hedging; embraces fragility (“tenuous only if left unleavened”) as thematic engine.</comment>
