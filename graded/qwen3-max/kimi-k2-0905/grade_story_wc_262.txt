<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation—recovering her mother’s lost song through psychometry—is rooted in specific, embodied longing and consistent with her spatially imaginative perception. Her internal conflict (wanting closure vs. fearing emptiness) manifests physically: trembling fingertips, whispered lyrics, the act of scratching new words onto film. The final choice—to project love forward rather than hoard it—is earned by prior causality and carries emotional cost (tears, letting go). No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile detail and ritualized action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “Love is never unused, only stored in dark rooms until someone projects it.” The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds through sensory layering (dust, nitrate wax, hushed thunder), culminating in the film strip threading itself. Cost is legible: Mara breaks the seal on a blank letter that becomes full, signifying emotional labor made visible. Orientation anchors firmly by line 3; no disorientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The projection booth functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: its narrow stair, rusted reel, and velvet seats directly shape Mara’s movements and discoveries. The screen, cigarette case, and storm outside evolve causally with the plot—the balcony door opens *because* of projected sound. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: early focus on dust and rust gives way to glowing crystal and rain. Final image of pigeons as “white sprocket holes” ties environment to theme without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering the lost chorus to complete her mother’s goodbye—is signaled early and deepens when the film strip moves autonomously, raising the cost from passive hope to active participation. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she threads the projector, sings, scratches new lyrics. The tightening occurs when she realizes the blank letter *is* the vessel for future love, forcing a renunciation of possessive grief. Coincidence (storm, self-threading film) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her choice to inscribe release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: unused love isn’t wasted but stored, awaiting projection. The final image—letter becoming film strip threading into Mara’s chest—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates through silence (blank page), gesture (breaking wax seal), and recurring motifs (sprockets, light). No thematic echo; the mother’s postscript feels discovered, not declared, and reweights all prior imagery of storage and darkness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Mara sees memory as overlay (“remembered brightness”), hears storms as “applause trapped behind velvet.” Rhythmic control under pressure is masterful—sentences shorten during vision sequences (“Mechanisms creaked; the motor coughed but turned”) then expand lyrically at climax. No head-hopping; single POV remains tight. Voice modulates with emotional intensity: clinical precision (“tweezers,” “emulsion”) yields to poetic compression (“love loops, a film strip searching for the splice”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density: “wax that smelled of nitrate film” conveys scent, era, and emotional residue in five words. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“dust floated like slow film frames”) and paid off (“pigeons fluttered like white sprocket holes”). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor deduction for one slightly overripe phrase (“hatched” love), but closure image remains clear and unblurred by ornament.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cinema, psychometry, and maternal absence feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (haunted theater, magical realism) are transformed through specific mechanics: love stored in celluloid emulsion, projection as ritual. Bold risk—making the film strip animate itself—is earned by established rules (crystal powered by storm, nitrate wax as emotional conduit). The passerby humming the full chorus at the end avoids sentimentality by grounding transcendence in urban continuity.</comment>
