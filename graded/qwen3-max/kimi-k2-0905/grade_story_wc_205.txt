<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Aurelia’s motivation is crystalline: to reimagine a failed revolution through poetic re-creation, not political action. Her interiority is embodied in tactile choices—covering mirrors with velvet, crushing the shard—and her contradictions (defunct yet defiant, aged yet visionary) pulse through every gesture. The final renunciation—destroying the shard to seed a new crystal—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; even her whispered stanza feels like lived breath, not thesis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shard’s destruction births a civilization that exists because it was poetically reimagined, reweighting failure as generative act. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of imagery (mirrors, time-storm, velvet) intensifies toward a cadence shift in the final stanzas. Cost is legible in Aurelia’s dissolution into “burnished sorrow” and the archaeologist’s transformed recorder. Orientation is immediate (“defunct revolutionary… pressed her palm”), and the pattern pays off without disorientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid isn’t backdrop—it’s crucible. Mirrors multiply temporal storms; velvet drapes are tactical tools; the collapsed harpsichord hides the shard. Every object constrains choice: the cello becomes a platform, the pedestal a sacrificial altar. Sensory detail (obsidian walls, ink-and-rain air) is filtered through Aurelia’s poetic urgency. The setting charges the final image—the newborn crystal humming in a mirrorless palace—and fulfills the 9+ gate by shaping both method and meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming unrealized futures—is signaled early and deepens when Aurelia chooses poetic reimagining over artifact preservation. Her agency drives escalation: covering mirrors thwarts the storm, crushing the shard seeds a new world. Cost is unmistakable: her body dissolves, yet her verses endure. The archaeologist’s intrusion raises pressure without resolving via coincidence—he’s transformed by her act, not its solver.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: banned mirrors, courts of self-judgment, fountains of unsent letters. No moralizing—resonance arises from the shard drinking verses and the archaeologist quoting anonymous lines. The ending reweights failure as fertile ground: revolutions arriving “too early” lacquer history with sorrow bright enough to read by. Central question—can imagination redeem political defeat?—is answered non-literally through the crystal’s rebirth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is a singular perceptual signature: Aurelia notices time as “visible,” storms as “silk scarves soaked in blood,” sorrow as something “tucked into bed.” Syntax modulates with pressure—long lyrical sentences for reflection, sharp fragments for action (“She lifted it like a dagger of light”). No head-hopping; even the archaeologist’s brief POV is filtered through Aurelia’s gaze (“visor reflecting her aged face multiplied into a jury”). Diction stays within her poetic lexicon, never drifting into academic register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot (“boulevards named after poets, courts where judges spoke only in questions”). Figurative language is coherent—time pulses, storms twist like scarves, light expands like dawn. No loops or scaffold; even repeated motifs (mirrors, shards) evolve functionally. Minor deduction for slight over-density in the storm description, but closure remains lucid and unmarred by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms revolutionary tropes through poetic specificity: failure isn’t redeemed by victory but by lyrical re-creation. The baroque asteroid, visible time, and silica-stored anthems feel inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk—making poetry the engine of world-building—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Every element coheres into an authentic vision where sorrow is luminous and revolutions are measured in stanzas, not statutes.</comment>
