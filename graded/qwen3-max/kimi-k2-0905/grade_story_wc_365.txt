<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The map maker’s interiority is vividly embodied—her sensory perception, guilt, and moral reckoning arise through concrete action, not diagnosis. Her final choice to redirect future commissions emerges organically from the revelation of complicity, with clear cost: the collapse of her prior identity as neutral cartographer. Contradictory impulses (longing vs. duty, curiosity vs. dread) operate simultaneously in key moments, especially when reaching toward her younger self. No safety-hedging; her flaw—weaponized ignorance—is fully owned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: truth redefined as “the mass of what you still carry,” crystallizing into a Charged Poise where she commits to mapping consequences, not places. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—density builds via sensory filaments, parallel bays, and the shard’s song—culminating in a decisive reconfiguration of purpose. Cost is legible in the bruised-gold dawn and the dull shard: innocence is gone, replaced by burdened clarity. Orientation is immediate and functional disorientation serves the closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The repair bay functions as micro-setting and crucible: its geometry bends under the shard’s influence, channels movement, and supplies the locker containing the data cube. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—rust-dust taste, emerald flashes, zero-g pulse—filtered through the map maker’s profession and trauma. The environment constrains every choice: bulkheads redirect balance, strands weave at her ankles, vacuum forces bodily adaptation. Final image (bay exhaling into a question) is charged by prior spatial logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering withheld truth—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: she presses the shard, steps through the loom, pries open the locker. Each action narrows options: touching the younger self fails, forcing redirection; swallowing the cube commits her to irreversible knowledge. Cost is unmistakable: she learns she funded the cover-up, weaponizing her own craft. Escalation follows Accumulative pressure—filaments accumulate in her nerves until the final reweighting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme—truth as weight borne after erasure—emerges through concrete particulars: the shard, the cube, copper wire veins. No moralizing; the note (“Truth is the mass…”) feels discovered, not declared. Final image reweights everything: the bay’s exhalation becomes a question she’s ready to answer, transforming passive mapping into active reckoning. Subtext thrives in silence, vibration, and withheld starlight—resisting binaries while condemning complicity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is singular, lyrical, and sensorially precise—syntax mirrors weaving motion (“strands tighten… with every heartbeat”), rhythm accelerates during threshold crossings. POV remains tightly focalized; even dream-murmurs are filtered through bodily memory. No head-hopping, no register drift. The prose modulates under pressure: short clauses in vacuum (“stars visible through girder ribs”), lush textures in loom sequences. Distinct perceptual signature—mapping via vibration, temperature, ache—defines every observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (shard as tuning fork, loom as threshold) and pays off without muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“scent of grease or ozone or lilac rain”) slightly dilutes urgency, but no loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s cadence—“next threshold, next withheld star, next sentence”—perfectly echoes opening while recharging motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fusion of cartography, grief, and quantum ethics—mapping as moral act. Tropes (parallel worlds, lost lover) are transformed through specificity: truth measured in “pressure of absence,” weapons hidden in disassembled ships. Risk-taking (non-causal structure, sensory abstraction) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight: every filament leads to the decision to chart consequences.</comment>
