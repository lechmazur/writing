<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motivation—discovering purpose in the pauses—is embodied through tactile, contradictory choices: crushing the ledger yet drawing its line on her skin, leaving beads then reclaiming them. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead revealing struggle through profession-specific perception (“patterns in morning frost that silvered the ground like her own imperfect glazing”). The final renunciation of vengeance for communal healing is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the loss of revenge, the studio, and certainty. Her flaw—curiosity punished by fire—drives both her past complicity and present redemption without safety-hedging.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she steps off the path of pursuit into a new vocation, foreclosing revenge with tangible cost (the scattered ledger, the reclaimed beads). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—pressure builds via sensory density and recurring motifs (glass, frost, charcoal) rather than causal chains. The canyon setting anchors orientation by line 3; disorientation is never an issue. Cost is legible in the final image: “a blank gather of molten light,” implying both loss and possibility shaped by prior fire.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The canyon functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: frost reveals smuggler tracks, schist retains warmth that informs timing, narrow walls compress sky into “a blade of starlight” that mirrors her narrowed options. Sensory detail is profession-filtered—she reads frost like glaze, hears wind as “stone throats,” sees cart wheels as “delicate commas.” The final image of glass fragments igniting in sunlight directly charges closure, transforming environment into active collaborator in her rebirth. Every atmospheric detail serves character or stakes without stalling momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding meaning in the “pause between sale and seizure”—is signaled early and deepens when she realizes the ledger isn’t a map forward but “permission to step off the path.” Escalation is driven by her agency: interpreting frost, planting then retrieving beads, choosing stillness over pursuit. Cost is unmistakable: she abandons the quest for names/revenge, accepting uncertainty. The ash-circle campfire and outward-pointing bootprints crystallize the smugglers’ schism, forcing her reconfiguration without coincidence resolving pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: glassmaking lexicon (“gather,” “pontil rod,” “glaze recipe”) merges with moral inquiry. The central question—can transparency exist without secrets?—is answered non-literally in the final action: blowing a new orb while hosting “quiet hours at dawn.” Subtext operates in silence (coyote song, drifting resonance) and gesture (crushing charcoal, pocketing obsidian). No moralizing; wisdom is earned through fire-survival and embodied in communal invitation. The scorched testament’s transformation from evidence to skin-mark to ghost-print reweights all prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is luminous yet precise, with a perceptual signature rooted in glass artistry: “frost that silvered the ground like her own imperfect glazing,” “sky became a blade of starlight.” Syntax modulates under pressure—short clauses during flight (“boots soft on frozen sand”), lyrical cadence in reflection. POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping, no omniscience. Elision is purposeful (no smuggler dialogue, no backstory dump), and the lyric mode is taught early (“air so cold it rang”) and paid off in closure (“world was a blank gather of molten light”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is consistent and coherent—glass/frost/charcoal motifs interweave without contradiction. Rhythm varies naturally; paragraph lengths mirror emotional cadence (longer in reflection, fragmented in action). Minor overwriting in “bubbled into braille-like ridges” risks purple prose, but it’s redeemed by immediate tactile payoff (“blistering her lips”). No loops, scaffold, or register drift; closure image remains sharp despite poetic compression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of glass artistry, smuggling ledger, and moral pause feels inevitable yet fresh. Tropes (fugitive artist, burned studio) are transformed by specific craft logic: glazing false windows for customs, reading frost as glaze patterns. The core premise—a ledger decoded not for names but for silences—offers a non-obvious angle on justice. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over plot causality) heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Voice, subject, and structure cohere as singular artistic stance; removing any element would fracture the story’s integrity.</comment>
