<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is precise and embodied—her scruples, resentment, and quiet hope manifest through micro-choices (tracing the ticket, withdrawing silently, threading the reel). Her final renunciation (“I’m letting both go”) earns closure with visible cost: relinquishing accusation to restore trust. Rico and Jun’s presence sharpens relational stakes without flattening them into types; their dialogue reveals motive and regret credibly. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion arises through tactile detail (warm paper, wet gravel voice).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mira forgoes confrontation, choosing communal healing over justice, with clear relational cost. The Causal lens holds—each beat follows “because/therefore”: discrepancy → doodles → booth search → eavesdrop → revelation → projection. The archival reel functions as a decisive act that reconfigures group dynamics. Cost is legible in Rico’s pale face and the “funeral march” pulse—emotional stakes crystallize without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt after rain isn’t backdrop—it pressures action: wet stone smell grounds perception, rainwater threads pillars during climax, and the space expands post-reconciliation. The projector lens functions as micro-setting: its absence motivates plot, its return enables resolution. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mira’s focus—sound (footsteps, hush), touch (warm paper, smooth glass), then sight (projected images). Weather and emergency lights shape mood and visibility without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—thawing mistrust—is signaled early and tightens when eavesdropping reveals the prank’s unintended harm. Mira’s agency drives escalation: her choice to follow doodles, then withhold confrontation, forces Rico and Jun into vulnerability. The cost—social isolation transformed into shared labor—is felt in their pale faces and sweeping side by side. Coincidence never resolves; honesty as method creates the turn, not luck.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through object and action: the lens (clarity), doodles (coded truth), and silent film (unspoken history) coalesce into a non-literal answer—trust restored not by words but shared witnessing. No moralizing; the open lock doodle implies release without explanation. Complexity endures: the prank was cruel, yet absolution feels earned because it’s enacted, not declared. Final image reweights the “wound” of the ticket into a key.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled—Mira’s perceptual signature filters every detail (e.g., “pigeons stopped pretending to care”). Voice modulates under pressure: lyrical in stillness (“snow fall upward”), terse in discovery (“pulse stumbled”). Dialogue is sparse but distinct—Rico’s mutter vs. Jun’s aphorism—and serves subtext (“honesty is the key”). No head-hopping; even eavesdropped lines remain anchored to Mira’s auditory frame.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: “dust floated like plankton,” “voice soft as wet gravel.” Figurative language is pattern-taught (whispering forecourt → resonant hush) and pays off. Minor redundancy in “resonant hush” recurrence, but not looped. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Closure image (“cloak that fit at last”) avoids purple prose while deepening theme.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms workplace mistrust trope through specific mechanics: cryptic doodles as narrative engine, projector lens as moral fulcrum, silent film as apology. Emotional truth outweighs novelty—the ache of frozen colleagues feels lived-in. Risk in withholding dialogue until midpoint pays off by making Mira’s solitude palpable. Final reconfiguration (sweeping together) feels inevitable yet fresh, rooted in concrete objects and choices.</comment>
