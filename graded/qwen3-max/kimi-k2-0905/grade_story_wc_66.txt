<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mila’s motivation—preserving narrative through coded musical transcription—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies under pressure. Her internal conflict (longing vs. survival) manifests in micro-choices: rosin ink, hidden pages, antenna weaving. The final act of endurance—copying amid inspectors—forecloses escape but affirms her purpose with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in tactile detail (“mist tasting of iron,” “pencil hovered”).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: dust becomes narrator, reweighting silence into story. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds via recurring phrases, rosin ink, and solstice timing—culminating in a chord that forces inspectors to confront burned narratives. Cost is legible: Mila stays, exposed, yet the system cracks. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ember alcove, mist, and shortwave dial aren’t backdrop—they constrain and enable. Mist “crouches,” radio glow is the only trusted light, rosin scraped from cellos becomes ink. Final image: green dial afterglow as “tiny green planet” recharges the opening. Setting functions as micro-setting, tool, and atmospheric pressure fused into one resonant ecosystem.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—smuggling stories past narrative ban—tightens when Mila learns the broadcast encodes meaning in intervals. Her agency drives escalation: decoding, rosin ink, copper antennae. Cost is felt: risk of capture, labor, solitude. Solstice timing creates a live clock; inspectors’ intrusion tests her stance. Coincidence never resolves—only her preparation does.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme—story as irrepressible vibration—emerges through concrete particulars: rests smuggling meaning, dust learning to speak. No moralizing; resonance lives in “uniforms shedding ash like pages turning.” Final image reweights silence: not emptiness, but latent narrative. Subtext thrives in musical coding—minor thirds for grief, tritones for rebellion—making censorship futile against embodied memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyrically precise, filtered through Mila’s copyist sensibility: “mist curled like forgotten sheet music,” “rosin-inked notation.” Syntax modulates with pressure—longer cadences early, taut phrases at climax (“sound had become fog”). No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. Elision is taught early (“story famine”) and paid off in closure’s whispered dust.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid, every sentence multitasking: “embers plot their escape as sparks” advances theme, character, and atmosphere. Figurative language is coherent—light bends “like stained glass,” mist is “clouded testimony”—no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in two high-pressure beats (e.g., “chord no baton had ever cleaved”), but clarity remains intact. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis: musical notation as resistance, dust as archive. Transforms censorship tropes through specific craft—rosin ink, interval coding—making the premise feel inevitable. Bold risk: lyric accumulative structure over causal plot, yet stakes remain urgent. No derivative echoes; voice, concept, and setting cohere into singular artistic stance. Closure feels earned, not gimmicky.</comment>
