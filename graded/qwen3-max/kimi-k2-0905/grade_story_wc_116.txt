<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The chronicle keeper’s motivation—to witness without judgment—is embodied through consistent micro-choices (e.g., refusing to save the war chronicle) and reinforced by visible cost (memories draining, transformation into silence). Her internal contradiction—desire to preserve vs. duty to refrain—is subtly active in scene, not summarized. However, her final renunciation leans slightly toward inevitability over active choice, softening the causal punch needed for a 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the keeper becomes the next fold, reweighting witnessing as participation. Cost is legible in “memories flatten, ink draining,” and the mirror-water bearing weight “without ripple” crystallizes Earned Stasis. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via recurring folds, feathers, silence—and the cryptic swan’s self-rewriting pattern pays off cohesively at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The overgrown library functions as micro-setting that actively constrains and charges the closure: shelves become trees, parchment regenerates blankness, roots feed silence. Obsidian refuge and river mirror are tactile anchors that evolve meaning—from external object to internalized state—and directly enable the keeper’s transformation. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through the keeper’s reverent POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving regenerative silence without interference—is signaled early and tightens when the swan unfolds its final map. The keeper’s agency lies in renunciation, not action; her choice to step onto the mirror forecloses her prior role with irreversible cost (flattened memories, becoming the swan). Pressure accumulates texturally rather than causally, fitting the lens, though escalation lacks a single decisive narrowing of options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: witnessing as a form of folding reality into weightless shapes. The final image—new keeper lifting silence “thick enough to cup”—reweights all prior acts of non-intervention as generative sacrifice, not passivity. No moralizing; subtext lives in feather, swan, and blank scrolls. Ambiguity lingers (is silence preservation or erasure?), but resonance is undeniable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, rhythmic, and deeply interior: syntax mirrors the keeper’s meditative pace (“walls warping into shelves of moss-laced parchment”), then compresses during transformation (“sandals sinking… stone were merely another page”). POV remains tightly focalized; perceptual signature is consistent (noticing creases, ink stains, sighing drawers). Elision is pattern-taught (folds rewriting) and paid off without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; nearly every line serves atmosphere, character, or motif. Figurative language is controlled (“silence pool beneath the stone like breath held too long”) and coherent across beats. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“shelves folding into wings of paper cranes that dissolved into ash”) risks density overload, but closure remains sharp. No loops, scaffold, or syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ingenuity lies in transforming passive witnessing into active mythic succession. The origami swan as recursive guide, regenerative silence as ecosystem, and library as living organism feel fresh yet inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric structure, abstract stakes) heightens thematic resonance without gimmickry. Every element interlocks—removing any would fracture the story’s delicate logic.</comment>
