<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation—preserving wonder against routine—is embodied in micro-choices (recalibrating the turnstile, ascending the tower) and intensified by her involuntary truthfulness. Her internal contradiction (routine vs. awe) acts simultaneously in scene, not as summary. The final lie is earned by prior causality and exacts conceptual cost: she surrenders her rigid honesty to reignite magic. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are tactile (“taste of sulfur,” “hair lift”).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the riddle’s lie reactivates the hive, reweighting the premise that wonder requires human participation, not just engineering. Cost is legible—the queen’s death, the boy’s disappearance, Mara’s forfeited truth—and the drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: sensory density (ozone, nectar dusk, copper bees) intensifies toward Charged Poise at dawn. Orientation anchors are immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The lightning tower functions as micro-setting: its sealed hive, cooling rods, and maintenance stairs directly constrain choices (Mara must climb manually) and charge the climax (copper cones “hungry for voltage”). “Nectar dusk” evolves from visual motif to emotional register, culminating in wax puddles reflecting Mara’s face. Every detail serves pressure or closure; no white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving wonder—is signaled early and deepens when the riddle demands a lie, forcing Mara to betray her truth-bound nature. Escalation is driven by her agency: accepting the box, climbing, speaking falsehood. Cost is unmistakable: loss of identity (“I keep nothing but the gate”) and irreversible change (coins etched with bees, open gate at dawn). Coincidence complicates (blackout) but doesn’t resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: engineered bees fail, but human curiosity reignites wonder via a necessary lie. The final image—matchbox in ticket slot promising “wonder preserved if you speak the lie that keeps you honest”—offers non-literal resolution without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (boy vanishing), gesture (cupping flame), and charged objects (lacquer box). Complexity embraced: truth inhibits magic; lies sustain it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Mara notices rust made sweet by nectar dusk, hears the turnstile’s “brass heart beat.” Rhythm modulates under pressure—long lyrical sentences early, staccato beats during ascent (“each step echoing like a dropped coin”). Elision is purposeful (no exposition on drone tech); POV remains tightly focalized. Voice never slips into diagnostic or academic register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “amber light that made even rust look sweet,” “wax wings melted into golden puddles.” Figurative language is coherent (bees → coins → wonder) and avoids purple overload. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary. Final line crystallizes motif without redundancy. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in hive reanimation beat, but clarity intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Premise transforms tropes: lightning harvesting meets beekeeping, truth-telling meets necessary lies. Synthesis feels inevitable—only a truth-bound keeper could unlock wonder via falsehood. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over causality) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision is singular: a world where magic persists only when humans risk dishonesty to preserve awe.</comment>
