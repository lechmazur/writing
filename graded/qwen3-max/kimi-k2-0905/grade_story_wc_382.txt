<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motivation evolves from surface curiosity to profound stewardship, credibly earned through embodied choices (e.g., pressing the seal to stone, accepting the “lie” of sugar). The tutor’s liminal existence is revealed without melodrama, and her dissolution feels inevitable yet costly. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels—emotions manifest through tactile detail (“brass still warm,” “eyes carried constellations”). The final micro-choice to knock on Mrs. Chen’s door reconfigures solitude into shared ritual, closing one path (apprentice) while opening another (teacher).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator becomes the new keeper of “agreed upon lies,” with visible cost in inherited loneliness and responsibility. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—the meteor shower’s Latin hexameter, recurring seal, and rooftop garden deepen thematic density without causal breaks. Every beat tightens around architectural memory vs. human transience; the gargoyle’s final line crystallizes the before/after. Cost is legible in the seal’s added weight: “every story the house had never told.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The rooftop garden isn’t backdrop but active crucible: its “ill-fitting crown” burdens the building, meteors translate sky-language into Latin, and rosemary pots ground intimacy. The desk seal—a micro-setting—constrains choice (interrogating stone) and charges closure (owl now blinking). Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: steam as incense during calm, limestone whispers under meteoric pressure. Final image of steam spelling “stay” ties environment to emotional stakes, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transcending loneliness through shared language—is signaled early and deepens when the tutor reveals her summoned nature. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to “interrogate” the gargoyle triggers the building’s confession, which catalyzes the tutor’s dissolution. Cost is unmistakable: inheriting unspoken stories and eternal vigilance (“we will crumble together”). The tightening forecloses the student role, forcing assumption of teacherhood with architectural weight as price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: buildings remember via “stress fractures,” renovations are “polite erasure,” and “agreed upon lies” sustain connection. The ending offers non-literal resolution—the gargoyle naming the narrator “new linguist”—reweighting all prior rituals (sugar-borrowing, tea) as sacred transmission. No moralizing; resonance accrues via the seal’s imprint (“stay”) echoing across human and stone. Complexity thrives: loneliness isn’t cured but conjugated into collective endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV maintains consistent perceptual signature: noticing architectural grammar before emotions (“cornices,” “cracked brick”). Voice modulates rhythmically—lyric cadence during meteors (“dactyls of fire”), terse resolve at closure (“I will shelter... we will crumble”). Elision is pattern-taught (tutor’s origin hinted then revealed) and paid off. Dialogue is sparse but distinct: tutor’s parables vs. Mrs. Chen’s practical “why eyes carry constellations?”—both advancing plot through subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density: “steam rose like incense” conveys ritual, atmosphere, and transience. Figurative language is coherent (meteors as “Latin hexameter,” roof “sigh[ing] in architectural relief”) without muddle. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“She carried,” “Tonight she pressed,” “I understood”). Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “dactyls of fire spelling out conjugations”—elevated diction justified by tutor’s lexicon but risks register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Transforms tropes (ghost tutor, sentient architecture) through hyper-specificity: Latin hexameter meteors, sugar-borrowing as linguistic ritual, “grammar of cracked brick.” The synthesis feels inevitable—rooftop solitude conjugated like verbs, buildings as weary elders. Risk-taking (accumulative structure, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final image of jasmine-scented sugar as “walls remembering summer” offers fresh emotional calculus: preservation through shared fiction.</comment>
