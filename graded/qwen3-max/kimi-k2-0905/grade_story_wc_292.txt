<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation—rooted in ancestral erasure and archival justice—is embodied through tactile actions (decoding stanzas, clutching the nail) and internal contradiction (“nervously confident”). Her final choice to stay and etch coordinates enacts Earned Stasis with visible cost: she trades return for remembrance. Voss’s parallel loss deepens relational pressure without diluting Mara’s agency. The copper nail’s transformation from relic to stylus crystallizes her legacy-bound resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: exile is reversed not by bureaucratic pardon but by proving the journey worth remembering. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via decoded stanzas, micro-maps, and refracted light until the final image reweights “weather” as memory. Cost is legible in Mara’s scarred palm and Edda’s verdigris thumbprint. Every beat tightens toward this reconfiguration without causal slippage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The weather station functions as micro-setting: aluminum walls mildew, plankwalks sponge rain, holotables refract light—all constrain or charge key choices. The copper nail (body/tool-as-setting) imprints Mara’s palm during flight and becomes a glass-etching stylus. Final image of refracted bravery maps onto rain “with purposeful direction,” fulfilling the 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy shifts credibly—from kelp-stench urgency to calm-evening clarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering erased bravery—is signaled early and deepens when Voss reveals his brother’s loss, merging personal and institutional stakes. Mara’s agency drives escalation: decoding, assembling maps, launching the dirigible. Cost is felt in the temporary scar and permanent moral burden. Coincidence (Voss’s kinship) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the wreck’s location is earned through overlaid drift models.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: salt-cipher stanzas, inverted coastlines, verdigris signatures. The central question—“What bravery is so inconvenient we erase its coordinates?”—is answered non-literally by refracted light etching overlooked routes onto glass. No moralizing; resonance accrues via recurring images reweighted at closure. Complexity endures: ministers’ ancestors were saved by the erased act, implicating systemic denial without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Mara notices patina matching mildew, ink bleeding into semaphore, sky “glowing old pennies.” Rhythmic control under pressure—lullabies aid decoding, short clauses heighten squall tension—never sacrifices clarity. Voice remains consistent through reflection (BRR-compliant: <20%, anchored to nail/journals). No head-hopping; Voss’s dialogue carries occupational idiom (“restricted test zone”) without convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density: “spongey plankwalk,” “boiling quadrant,” “salt-cipher” do triple duty. Minor overwriting in “experimental kites fought the newborn wind shears”—mixed metaphor slightly muddles causality. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s cadence modulates perfectly from action (“etched Edda’s coordinates”) to lyric refrain (“reversible as breath, eternal as weather”).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: archival justice meets meteorological poetics. Tropes (exile, coded journals) transformed via salt-cipher mechanics and jet-stream-as-library. Risk-taking (lyric structure, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight—Edda’s route *becomes* the new jet stream—and irreplaceable: no other setting or method could carry this thematic weight.</comment>
