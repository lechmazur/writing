<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation—rooted in ancestral legacy and acoustic perception—drives every micro-choice, from planting the seed to crafting the wire bridge. Her interiority is embodied (“drip of condensation... struck her ear as a minor seventh”), avoiding diagnostic abstraction. The final renunciation (leaving the bowl humming) earns Charged Poise with visible cost: she abandons completion for invitation. No head-hopping; single POV remains taut and sensorially precise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “beauty in the unfinished is not abandonment but invitation” crystallizes into action—the unresolved notes become generative. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with cadence shifts (fragmented phrases, echoes flattening) reweighting the stake. Cost is legible in the glowing bowl, split seed, and drowned bell—all tied to persistent constraints (ash, silence, shipwrecks). Orientation anchors instantly (“ash-slick mud,” “sunken orchard greenhouse”).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The sunken greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks isn’t backdrop—it actively shapes tactics: glass echoes guide Mara’s phrasing, durian roots frame her kneeling, submerged bell answers percussion. Every sensory detail serves pressure (“charred mango pits,” “soot-streaked glass”) and filters through acoustic perception. Final image (“green as a new question against copper light”) charges the setting with thematic weight. Micro-setting (bowl, wire, soil) constrains choice and culminates in resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming silence into generative music—is signaled early and tightens when Mara chooses incompleteness over resolution. Agency drives escalation: planting the seed, whispering the story, twisting rigging into a bridge. Cost is unmistakable: empty bowl, cracked instrument tradition, drowned stories. The chronic hush lifts only through earned, incomplete gestures—no coincidence resolves pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the violin’s unresolved cadence, grandmother’s bonfire bowl, shipwreck listeners. Final image reweights all prior material—unfinished notes become fertile ground, not failure. Avoids moralizing; instead offers resonant CR: continuation requires refusal to conclude. Subtext thrives in silence, echoes, and the seedling’s green question—no prompt-like articulation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is immaculately controlled—first-person limited through Mara’s acoustically tuned perception. Voice modulates rhythmically: long lyrical sentences for memory, fractured phrases for performance. Diction stays within plausible lexicon (“mendicant’s bowl,” “minor seventh”) without academic drift. No dialogue, so voice distinction irrelevant; prose-as-character shines in syntactic mimicry of musical phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each line multitasks (e.g., “masts leaning like tired listeners” establishes setting, mood, and auditory expectation). Figurative language is pattern-taught (musical metaphors) and pays off in closure (“humming bowl”). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary naturally. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in “chronic hush answered, widening like a held breath”—borderline mixed metaphor—but clarity at closure remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes through acoustic specificity and familial ritual. The fusion of violinist, mendicant bowl, and shipwreck chorus feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking (lyric structure, unresolved ending) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise—music as resurrection via incompleteness—is non-obvious and fully committed, with emotional truth overriding novelty.</comment>
