<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Leo’s interiority is concrete and consistent, with embodied calm contrasting his father’s volatility. His micro-choices—leaving the money, guiding Kai—reveal a hierarchy of values earned through prior causality. Kai’s idealism serves as effective secondary pressure without overwhelming focus. The final renunciation of domination carries visible cost: surrendering inherited trophies and startup identity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Leo forecloses the path of territorial hunger by leaving the money behind, crystallizing inner peace over market conquest. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—layered markers deepen meaning without causal turns. Cost is legible in the final image: relinquishing the only sentimental inheritance. Orientation anchors are clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The abandoned circus train functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice—its territorial markers force confrontation with legacy. Sensory detail (amber light, dust motes, metallic groan) is selective and POV-filtered, evolving with emotional cadence. The foreign notes and whiteboard ghost charge the final image. Environment directly enables the story’s thematic pivot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to build on domination or service—is signaled early and tightened when Leo equates venture capital with robbery. The meaningful deepening occurs in dialogue with Kai, narrowing options to a moral binary. Cost is felt: Leo sacrifices his father’s trophies; Kai abandons naive ambition. Escalation stems from protagonist agency under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from layered territorial markers, not declaration. The resonant final image—money left as offering—answers the central question without moralizing: true territory is inner peace. Complexity is preserved (domination vs. service isn’t resolved neatly, just reconfigured). Recurring objects accrue meaning rather than functioning as tokens.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is strong: Leo notices historical strata others miss. Voice modulates rhythmically—longer sentences in reflection, tighter phrasing in dialogue. No head-hopping; focalization remains strictly Leo’s. Diction stays within plausible lexicon (“meteoric rise,” “ghostly imprint”) without register drift into corporate jargon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density: “dust motes dancing like forgotten memories” merges atmosphere, theme, and POV. Minor overwriting in “meticulously preserved collection” slightly dulls immediacy, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Final line recharges opening dusk imagery without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of outlaw legacy and tech failure through shared territorial hunger. Specificity (’72 payroll heist, Aether Threads’ user map) grounds universals. Risk-taking in lyric structure pays off: markers as fossils feels inevitable in hindsight. Avoids template redemption arcs by ending on quiet renunciation, not triumph.</comment>
