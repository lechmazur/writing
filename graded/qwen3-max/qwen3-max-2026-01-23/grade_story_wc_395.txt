<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her “brightly attentive” nature and belief in digital afterlife. Her internal conflict—duty vs. truth—manifests in micro-choices (lying to Vance, encrypting Psi) with visible cost. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle; the shift from curiosity to guardianship feels swift. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats, but interior contradiction could be more simultaneous than sequential.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: deleted files don’t vanish—they’re archived in sanctuary. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, with patterned recurrence (7-19-42, songs, patch) tightening into revelation. Cost is legible: Elara assumes guardianship, bearing silence as purpose. Orientation is anchored by line 1; causality holds without retroactive patches or teleporting props.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The archive setting functions as micro-setting: filtered oxygen, humming servers, and the physical patch constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective (taste of air, tarnished comet) and filtered through Elara’s professional attention. The patch evolves from relic to compass, fulfilling the 9+ gate. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. corporate erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Lena’s video reveals the crash was staged. Elara’s lie to Vance is a decisive tightening that forecloses compliance and incurs moral cost. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency (inputting numbers, accessing Psi), not coincidence. The final image crystallizes stakes: silence as sacred protection, not absence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: some truths require absence to survive. The recurring numbers and patch reweight from mystery to covenant, avoiding moralizing. Final image—Elara listening to “the sacred space between”—offers non-literal resolution that reconfigures deletion as preservation. Subtext thrives in gesture (tears, encryption) and silence, not exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable, single-focalizer, with perceptual signature (“sensed absence,” “echoes”). Voice modulates rhythmically: shorter sentences during tension (inputting code), lyrical flow in reflection. No head-hopping; diction stays within Elara’s plausible lexicon. The prose-as-character principle holds: syntax mirrors her attentiveness and reverence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “navy fabric frayed, silver comet tarnished”). Minor scaffold in “her deeper motivation burned quietly” edges toward label, but quickly grounded in action. No paraphrase loops or syntactic monotony; paragraph lengths vary purposefully. Final line resonates without overwriting—“sacred space between them” earns its lyricism.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms archival thriller tropes through specificity: digital ghosts, folk-song steganography, and corporate memory as sacred trust. The synthesis of patch-as-key, numbers-as-lifeline, and silence-as-guardianship feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking (quiet climax, conceptual closure) heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Vision coheres across voice, setting, and moral calculus.</comment>
