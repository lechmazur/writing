<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is singular and consistent—salvaging purity from tragedy—and her interiority is embodied through tactile interaction with the snow globe and dream data. Her micro-choices (filtering archives, synchronizing visions) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on truth over comfort. The final whisper enacts Earned Stasis: she endures emotional exposure to release the spirit, foreclosing further communion at visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; grief lifts as sensory fact, not therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the boy’s act reframes the Veridian’s narrative from selfish panic to quiet heroism, reweighting historical memory with undeniable moral cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—dream cameos accrue into pattern, then break with revelation. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3 (who/where/when), and the shrine’s ice-bound silence serves closure by preserving truth “in the eternal memory of the ice.” Cost is legible in the artifact’s shift from grief to forgiveness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glacier shrine functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its silence and borrowed starlight demand delicate perception, shaping Elara’s method. The melted snow globe—a recurring object—charges the final image when its tear-drop shape is reinterpreted as testament, not debris. Sensory detail is selective (candle hum, soot-swirl fluid) and filtered through Elara’s professional bias. Ice isn’t backdrop—it crystallizes truth, making environment indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—exposing the boy’s true final act—is signaled early and tightens when dream patterns reveal his placement near exits. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she actively synchronizes visions rather than passively receiving them. Cost is felt in the risk of shattering the spirit (“pulling too hard… could shatter the remnant”), though this danger remains abstract rather than dramatized in a failed attempt. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: courage persists even when history erases it. The snow globe’s transformation—from symbol of lost innocence to testament of sacrifice—offers a non-literal answer to whether purity can be salvaged from wreckage. No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete particulars (ash-petals, refusing engines). Final image reweights prior material: the shrine’s ice now holds not just memory but vindication, embracing complexity without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-limited, with perceptual signature rooted in Elara’s ghost-whisperer lexicon (“psychic resonance,” “windows of connection”). Syntax modulates under pressure—longer sentences for dream analysis, fragmented cadence during projection (“She closed her eyes…”). Voice remains consistent; no head-hopping or register drift. Prose-as-character: rhythmic control mirrors her meticulous craft, especially in the final whisper’s cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density: “luminescence that felt ancient and stolen” establishes tone, setting, and thematic tension in one phrase. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“Deep inside…”, “Elara sat…”, “As a wreck-diver…”). Figurative language is coherent (borrowed starlight, frozen cathedral) and never muddles peak beats. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “delicate, haunting quality of borrowed starlight”—elegant but redundant—but closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Core premise transforms tropes: ghost whispering via dream archives feels fresh, grounded in digital-age folklore. Specificity abounds—the Veridian’s fire-before-sinking, Lagos mechanic’s stalled engine—avoiding generic tragedy. Risk-taking (mosaic shards of strangers’ dreams) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The synthesis—using global subconscious as archive for drowned truth—feels inevitable in hindsight and irreplaceable to the story’s moral architecture.</comment>
