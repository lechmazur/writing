<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias’s reticence and warmth are embodied in micro-choices—his silent observation, the sea glass gift—that reveal a coherent hierarchy of values under pressure. Thomas’s fragility is shown through physical tremors and flinches, not diagnostic labels. Their dynamic functions as a crucible: Elias’s action directly stabilizes Thomas’s psyche. The final gesture earns Charged Poise with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias renounces speech to enact protection, foreclosing verbal reassurance in favor of symbolic action, with tangible emotional relief as cost/benefit. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the stone cairn and sea glass accumulate meaning until the final glow reweights the entire psychic atmosphere. Orientation is immediate (“Fresnel lens,” “supply skipper,” “Thomas”) and serves the haunted closure. No causality breaks; every beat tightens the psychological stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The lantern room functions as micro-setting: its glass walls trap Thomas, its haunted shadows press inward, and its spatial choreography (spiral stairs, windowsill) guides Elias’s ascent and placement of the sea glass. The environment constrains choice—no escape, only symbolic resistance—and charges the final image where amber light defies “gray hostility.” Sensory detail is selective (metal ringing, wind’s howl, sea-floor hum) and filtered through Elias’s professional, observant POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—psychological survival in isolation—is signaled early and deepens when the lamp fails. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his decision to add the sea glass transforms distress into endurance. The cost is legible in Thomas’s shuddering breath and loosened posture—a visceral shift from terror to safety. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, intensifying via object-based ritual rather than external threat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the stone-and-glass vernacular: human connection persists via anonymous, tactile gestures in desolate places. The final image—amber light casting a “luminescent ache”—offers a non-literal answer to isolation: safety isn’t grand rescue but shared symbolic resilience. No moralizing; subtext lives in silence, stacking, and glow. Recurrence of stones and glass reweights solitude from burden to collaborative endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited through Elias, with perceptual signature evident in maritime lexicon (“reticent skipper,” “human erosion,” “southern beach”). Syntax modulates under pressure—longer descriptive sentences early, tighter clauses during ascent, lyrical bloom at climax. Voice remains consistent, avoiding head-hopping or register drift. The prose embodies Elias’s quiet intensity without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or stakes (“silence like a heavy coat,” “shadows... eager to reclaim the space”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (light/dark, weight/pressure) and culminates coherently in the “luminescent ache.” Minor risk in sustained lyricism, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors emotional release—succinct, resonant, earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse tropes via the stone-message system and sea glass ritual—specific, grounded, irreplaceable. The “haunting” by shipwreck memory reframes supernatural dread as collective trauma. Risk-taking (silent protagonist, abstract stakes) heightens emotional authenticity without gimmickry. Vision feels singular: a coastal lexicon of survival written in pebbles and worn glass.</comment>
