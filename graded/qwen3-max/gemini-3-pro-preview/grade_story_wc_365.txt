<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in sensory memory and personal loss, with interiority rendered through embodied metaphors (“metallic taste of fear,” “crushing burden of the answer”). Her micro-choice to redirect the vision—“turning a rushing river with her bare hands”—reveals hierarchy of values: truth over peace. However, the final realization leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“the lie had been a mercy”) rather than messy, contradictory emotion under peak stress, costing full 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the withheld truth reframes the explosion not as betrayal but as necessary sacrifice, with undeniable conceptual cost (“protecting the world from... total annihilation”). The Causal lens holds—each beat follows because/therefore logic (shard → rift → vision → command audio). Cost is legible in the final image: bloodied hand, trembling legs, invisible weight. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no disorientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The repair bay functions as micro-setting: oil-stained floor, corroded roof, skeletal ships—all pressure Elara’s isolation and decay of truth. Crucially, the green glass shard (object-as-setting) constrains her method and charges the ending: it draws blood upon revelation, merging environment, tool, and body. Sensory detail is selective and profession-filtered (“sensory map maker” notices emotional textures, not mechanical specs), avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the truth behind the *Icarus* explosion—is signaled early and tightens when Elara fights temporal inertia to redirect the vision, narrowing options from infinite timelines to one damning audio clip. Agency drives escalation: her mental effort creates the reversal. Cost is unmistakable: physical collapse, emotional devastation, and the burden of knowledge that offers no catharsis—only heavier silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: truth vs. protective lies, the ethics of necessary destruction. The final image—Elara walking out bearing invisible weight—offers a non-literal answer: some truths are too corrosive for public consumption. No moralizing; resonance arises from the shard’s bloodied reprise and the reframed explosion. Complexity is preserved—the detonation was neither malice nor accident, but tragic calculus.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled first-person limited, with perceptual signature evident in synesthetic mapping (“velvet texture of nostalgia”). Voice modulates under pressure: prose compresses during the rift (“air pressure drop, a sudden vacuum”) then expands in revelation. No head-hopping; diction stays within Elara’s lexicon. The lyric fugue state is taught early (“murmur of half-remembered dreams”) and pays off coherently at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “dimensional rifts... felt in the marrow of one's bones” conveys mechanics, sensation, and character expertise). Minor overwriting in the multiverse sequence (“shimmering, translucent layers of infinite possibilities”) slightly dilutes urgency, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence shift—short, heavy sentences—perfectly mirrors thematic weight. Zero register drift or syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis: “sensory map maker” reframes sci-fi trope into emotional cartography. The green shard as timeline anchor feels fresh, not derivative. Risk-taking in structure (single-vision climax) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Premise avoids template by grounding cosmic stakes in intimate grief—Elara’s quest isn’t to stop doom but to weigh its moral cost. No safety hedging; the truth remains unbearable, not redemptive.</comment>
