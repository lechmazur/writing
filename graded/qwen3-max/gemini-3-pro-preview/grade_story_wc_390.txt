<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias’s “logically emotional” trait is embodied through precise micro-choices—removing gloves, vocalizing pitch—that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. His fear is biologicalized, not therapized, and his competence is balanced by genuine struggle against psychic resistance. The final renunciation (endurance as protection) carries visible cost: exhaustion, exposure, and emotional toll. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; interiority remains concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias endures, fulfills duty, and forecloses the spirits’ unrest at personal cost (“slumped against the railing”). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density increases via sensory and sonic layering until vibrational matching triggers release. Cost is legible in the final image: breath pluming, buttoned coat, quiet heart. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina isn’t backdrop—it groans, grinds, and transmits spectral screams that directly shape tactics. The lighthouse horn, key, and ice function as micro-settings that constrain choice: torque fails, so Elias must adapt via bare skin and voice. Final image recharges setting: frozen harbor shifts from “old bruises” to “peaceful” blue stillness. Sensory hierarchy (ozone, rot, fillings vibrating) reflects crisis urgency without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting the artifact—is signaled early and tightens when mechanical force fails, forcing adaptation. The meaningful deepening occurs when Elias abandons engineering rigidity for vibrational matching, narrowing options to one fragile method. Cost is unmistakable: exposed skin, vocal strain, bodily risk. Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency under Accumulative pressure; no coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sonic absolution as counterweight to unresolved trauma—peace granted not by silence but harmonic resolution. The final image (“dead were finally asleep”) offers non-literal answer: reconciliation through resonance, not erasure. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers (What sins? Whose?) without confusion. Core concept integrates with theme via specific action—vocal drone syncing with lock—not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Elias notices fillings vibrating, ozone-rot taste, brass console texture—all filtered through engineer’s precision. Voice modulates under stress: prose shortens during scream, expands during drone. Syntax mirrors internal state—fluid during sync, thunderous at clack. No head-hopping; single POV held with rhythmic control that heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense but clear; most sentences advance plot, character, or atmosphere. Minor overwriting in “fleshly ethereal” and “suspended violence” slightly muddles tone, but figurative language pays off in closure (“scrubbed clean from the inside out”). No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. One borderline mixed metaphor (“landscape of suspended violence” + “color of old bruises”) prevents 9+ but doesn’t dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sonic absolution as peace-granting mechanism feels fresh, grounded in acoustic physics and spiritual need. Tropes (lighthouse, key, spirits) are transformed by specificity: vibrational matching, iron-and-bone key, fillings vibrating. Risk-taking (non-visual climax, biologicalized fear) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision coheres: every element serves the core synthesis of engineering logic and ghostly resonance.</comment>
