<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo’s motivation is consistent and embodied—his quiet diligence, tactile engagement with the ticket, and final act of projection reveal a hierarchy of values (truth over silence). His internal conflict between duty and fear is subtle but legible in micro-choices: pausing at the doodle, choosing to eavesdrop, then acting without accusation. The resolution earns credibility through prior restraint, though his emotional shift lacks contradictory impulses in scene—relief arrives too cleanly. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains concrete and profession-bound.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the collective gaze transforms ambiguity into clarity, thawing mistrust without confrontation. The causal chain is tight—ticket → lens → revelation → projection—and each beat narrows options. Cost is legible: Silas’s crumpled relief shows the burden of misplaced guilt. The “washed sky” to “unburdened faces” arc fulfills the drive lens (Causal) with no retroactive patches or teleporting props.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt functions as micro-setting: its reflective surface enables the projection’s impact, and “whispering” acoustics shape the story’s hushed tone. Rain and dampness recur to mark temporal shifts and emotional states, never as cliché. The lens—a tool—constrains the climax: only through it can truth be seen. Sensory detail (gleaming stones, cool air) is selective, POV-filtered, and integrated into action, charging the final image without overwriting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transparency vs. institutional mistrust—is signaled early and deepens when Leo uncovers Elara’s accusation. The tightening occurs at the auditorium eavesdrop: knowledge shifts from suspicion to urgency. Protagonist agency drives escalation (seeking lens, projecting evidence), and cost is felt in Silas’s admission of error. However, the antagonist (absent embezzler) remains off-stage, slightly softening pressure; stakes rely on moral weight rather than immediate consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through objects and silence: honesty as shared sight, not accusation. The recurring “ambiguously clear” motif reweights at closure—what was once obscure becomes undeniable under collective witness. No moralizing; resonance arises from the projected image on wet stone, a non-literal answer to mistrust. Complexity is preserved: Elara was wronged, board members erred in good faith, and truth requires both artifact and audience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, filtered through Leo’s professional attentiveness (“auditing,” “resonant hush”). Voice modulates subtly—compressed syntax during tension (“Instinctively, Leo stilled”), lyrical cadence in reflection. Dialogue is sparse but distinct: Silas’s clipped insistence vs. Greta’s weary doubt. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent (notices lighting rigs, archival ephemera). Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors thematic resolution—quiet, cumulative, earned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is precise and rhythmic, with varied sentence openings and purposeful paragraph breaks. High information density: “wet crystal paving stones gleaming under a washed sky” establishes setting, mood, and motif in one stroke. Minor overwriting in “painful clarity” (near-therapy-speak), but quickly grounded in action. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent (“frost” of mistrust, “whispering” stones). Final line’s echo of the opening achieves lyric closure without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ingenuity lies in the forensic use of archival detritus—a doodled ticket as whistleblower—and the lens as both literal and metaphorical revealer. The quiet registrar trope is transformed by making observation active (eavesdropping, projection). Emotional truth outweighs novelty: mistrust thawed by shared seeing, not exposure. Risk-taking (minimal dialogue, passive protagonist) heightens stakes through restraint, though the embezzlement frame feels slightly familiar.</comment>
