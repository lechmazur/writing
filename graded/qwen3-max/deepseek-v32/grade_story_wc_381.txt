<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The summoner’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a desire to preserve cosmic-terrestrial balance, but his internal conflict remains abstract rather than embodied. His actions align with his goal, yet lack micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The final endurance (Earned Stasis) is credible but not forged through visible contradiction or struggle—more ritual than crisis. Emotional embodiment leans on lyrical phrasing (“tranquil blaze”) rather than sensory or physiological specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the prophecy is hushed, silence restored, at the cost of the summoner’s solitary labor and the origami wing’s dissolution. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—pressure builds through layered silence, culminating in the wing’s collapse into a sphere. Spatial and temporal anchors are clear by line 3; no orientation penalty. The final image (“memory of light on water”) reconfigures the earlier tension with resonant, irreversible calm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The brook, fireflies, willow leaves, and nocturnal haven form a micro-setting that actively enables the summoner’s method—water carries the wing, silence is mapped through its flow. The crane’s wing functions as both tool and micro-setting, constraining choice (must be placed on water) and charging the final image (its dissolution seals the hush). Sensory detail is selective, tactile, and filtered through ritual urgency—no white-room syndrome. The environment doesn’t just reflect mood; it is the medium of resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—hushing a chaotic prophecy before it unravels the world—is signaled early and tightens when the prophecy “resists” the summoner’s effort. The escalation is protagonist-driven: his intent flows into the wing, which then glows, collects code, and collapses. Cost is legible: the wing’s destruction and the summoner’s expended will. However, the “terrestrially cosmic” tension lacks concrete consequence beyond atmospheric dissonance—stakes feel grand but not viscerally tested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as active preservation, not absence; order maintained through ephemeral, self-sacrificing acts. The crane wing’s journey—from tool to vessel to dissolved memory—offers a non-literal answer to whether chaos must be spoken to exist. Final image reweights the opening: the brook’s flow now carries dormant secrets, implying some truths must remain unmapped. No moralizing; resonance arises from the wing’s transformation and the summoner’s quiet departure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: lyrical but precise, with a rhythmic cadence that mirrors the brook’s flow and the summoner’s intent. Syntax varies purposefully—long, liquid sentences for immersion; short phrases for intensity (“He persisted”). Perceptual signature is strong: the world is sensed through silence, vibration, and light. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Diction stays within plausible lexicon of a ritualist—elevated but never academic or jarring.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“mapping silence” both concept and action), but occasional overwriting appears in peak beats: “terrestrially cosmic” repeats three times, functioning more as incantation than clarity. Minor paraphrase loop: “whispered secrets that rustled… whispered secrets around him grew fainter.” Final third avoids artifacts, and closure image remains sharp. Read-aloud rhythm is fluid, though two adjacent sentences begin with “The summoner’s…”—a small template slip.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms the “chosen one silences prophecy” trope through specificity: the method is cartographic silence, the tool is origami, the cost is dissolution into water. The synthesis of cosmic and earthly via ripples of “silenced sound” feels fresh and inevitable. No derivative echoes; the tranquil blaze paradox elevates emotional stakes without gimmickry. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over plot) heightens thematic weight and remains coherent to the end.</comment>
