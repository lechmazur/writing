<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Aris’s motivation—philosophical curiosity sharpened by obsession—is consistent and embodied in her micro-choices, especially her lie to Kael, which carries visible emotional cost. Her internal conflict (truth vs. survival) acts simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality: her discovery forces a credible endurance that forecloses public revelation. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing mars her interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Aris buries the truth within herself, crystallizing a stance with felt cost (“physical weight in her chest”). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—the recurring numbers coalesce into pattern-break revelation—and it holds cleanly through closure. Cost is legible in the final image: the hidden cache becomes a grave marked only by her silence. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks or teleporting props.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The social network archive functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains choice—its structure enables Aris’s search and hides corporate lies. Sensory detail is selective (humming corridors, coldness, digital necropolis) and filtered through professional bias. The embroidered patch charges the final image, but the archive itself doesn’t directly limit tactics beyond data access. Vivid but stops just short of 9+ gate: environment shapes mood more than concrete action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving truth versus personal safety—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Kael intervenes. Aris’s agency drives escalation: her tracing of numbers leads to encrypted diary, then derelict morgue, culminating in the lie that forecloses public exposure. Cost is unmistakable: she bears the crew’s memory alone, “a silent, enduring record.” Coincidence complicates (recurring numbers), but resolution stems from her choices, not luck.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: deleted files go into keepers who choose to remember. The final image reweights the premise without moralizing—truth survives not in archives but in attentive silence. Recurring elements (numbers, patch, absence) accumulate pressure and charge closure. Avoids tidy resolution; embraces moral ambiguity (corporate deception vs. individual fidelity) with plausible counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable, first-person limited through Aris, with a distinct perceptual signature (“brightly attentive gaze,” noticing metadata anomalies). Voice modulates under pressure—prose tightens during confrontation with Kael. No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon. Minor uniformity in sentence rhythm during discovery sequence, but not enough to dull propulsion or clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise, with high information density—e.g., “frozen river of thoughts, songs, and faces” does triple duty. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. One slight overwriting in “digital necropolis” metaphor, but it’s consistent and paid off. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; closure beat remains clear and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms archival thriller tropes through specific emotional stakes: memory as burial, truth as private grave. The synthesis of digital archaeology and paternal grief feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk: quiet ending where victory is concealment, not exposure. Core premise avoids derivative safety by rooting cosmic loss in intimate objects (patch, poem) and institutional erasure.</comment>
