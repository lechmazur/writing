<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo’s reticence and warmth are embodied through precise gestures—stacking stones, placing sea glass—not labels. His motivation to “bottle safety” emerges organically from observed despair, not exposition. The ghost’s plight reframes his duty without over-explaining, preserving interiority. Final choice (bottling light) earns closure through prior consistency, though the epiphany leans slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tower holds internal light after the lamp fails, with cost felt in Leo’s enduring burden of bottled safety. Causal lens holds—each action (reading letter, stacking stones, bottling glow) stems from prior cause. The ghost’s backstory explains the flicker without retroactive patching. Orientation is clear by line 30; time pressure (“after the lamp flickered out”) tightens stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lantern room isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures choices: its haunted stillness demands response, its gallery enables stone messages, its broken lamp necessitates Leo’s ritual. Sea glass and cairn function as micro-settings that constrain and charge final image. Sensory detail (salt wind, cold iron rail) is selective, POV-filtered, and woven into action. “Luminescent ache” avoids cliché by grounding tone in embodied perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving safety for keepers—is signaled early and deepens when Leo learns the ghost’s fear. His agency drives escalation: reading letter → stacking stones → bottling light. Cost is visible: he carries the weight of bottled safety, sacrificing anonymity to intervene. Coincidence never resolves; the ghost’s presence complicates but doesn’t solve—Leo’s attention alone restores light.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—solitude soothed by anonymous care—emerges through actions, not statements. The sea glass and cairn reweight meaning: from talisman to shared token. Final image (tower holding inner light) offers non-literal answer: duty persists through human connection, not machinery. No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete particulars like the unsent letter chain and stacked stones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Leo’s observant silence. Voice modulates rhythm under pressure: short clauses during ascent (“He climbed… hand tracing”), lyrical flow in reflection. Diction stays within skipper’s lexicon—no register drift. Perceptual signature is consistent: notices textures (smooth stones, cold iron), omits irrelevant visuals, embodying “warmly observant” without stating it.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “luminescent ache” does thematic and atmospheric work. Minor flaw: “pour that essence… into the act of his attention” risks abstraction, but immediate dramatization (shimmering air, uncorking bottle) grounds it. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. No loops or scaffold—each line advances character, setting, or plot.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope by making haunting a failure of care, not malice. Stone-stacking as language feels fresh, rooted in maritime tradition. Bottling safety is a bold, specific conceit that heightens stakes without gimmickry. Synthesis of lighthouse lore, anonymous correspondence, and tactile ritual feels inevitable in hindsight, with irreplaceable elements (sea glass, cairn) driving closure.</comment>
