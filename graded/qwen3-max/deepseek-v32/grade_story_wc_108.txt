<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo’s phobia and stunt-double identity are tightly interwoven with his choices, especially his use of fear as tactical awareness during the climax. His internal contradiction—masking terror while performing underwater stunts—fuels credible micro-choices (e.g., angling the cast in starlight, edging toward water despite panic). However, Carl’s motivation leans slightly functional; his betrayal serves plot more than layered character. The final renunciation of “double” status is earned, but the epiphany edges toward diagnostic clarity (“vulnerability is power”) without enough embodied struggle to fully justify 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Leo walks away no longer afraid, redefining identity through action, not inheritance. The causal chain is tight—adoption letter → library search → decoded notes → confrontation—and the floor collapse is foreshadowed by the child’s cast warning. Cost is legible: Leo accepts his phobia as strength, foreclosing his old self. The drive lens is Causal, held consistently, with every escalation narrowing options until the decisive kick.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rusted library functions as both setting and micro-setting: its decay enables the floor collapse, and the seashell’s placement on a beam uses starlight as a tactical tool. Sensory detail is selective—orange decay, milky starlight, pulp-melting books—and filtered through Leo’s professional attention (noticing structural weakness). The recurring object (seashell) and environment directly constrain the climax. Only minor deduction: the “cold sprawl of stars” verges on lyrical abstraction without immediate tactile pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth of origin—is signaled early and deepens when the seashell whispers betrayal. Pressure escalates coherently: discovery → decryption → confrontation, with each turn forcing higher risk (entering ruin, approaching water). The tightening occurs when Leo realizes Carl is coming, converting vulnerability into strategy. Cost is felt: he must face the water to win. Slight deduction: Carl’s arrival feels slightly convenient, though his motive (silence) aligns with prior causality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: identity as adaptive performance, not fixed origin. The seashell shifts from “luck charm” to truth-teller, and the final image—Leo breathing with the night, unafraid—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture (trembling hands lifting the cast) and silence (not looking away as Carl falls). Avoids sentimentality by tying insight to physical action. Minor deduction: “trembling certainty” borders on abstract label in the closing line, slightly diluting resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable, first-person-limited interiority rendered through free indirect style (“phobia was a clenched fist”). Voice modulates under stress—shorter sentences during Carl’s entrance, lyrical cadence in reflection. Perceptual signature is strong: Leo notices structural details (rust thickness, support beams) as a stuntman would. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Carl’s “sentimental junk” reveals contempt. No head-hopping, and diction stays within plausible lexicon. Slight uniformity in sentence openings during climax prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and economical, with high information density (“cathedral of ruins,” “skeletal roof framed the night sky”). Figurative language is purposeful, not excessive. Minor flaws: “trembling certainty” appears twice, bordering on paraphrase-loop; “clenched fist in his chest” is a mild bodily cliché. Syntax varies effectively, though two adjacent sentences begin with “He” during the shelf flip. No scaffold or momentum drag; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Closure image remains sharp despite slight repetition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms the “secret origin” trope through specific, grounded choices: a stunt double’s phobia weaponized against his mentor in a decaying library. The seashell as truth-revealer avoids gimmickry by tying to Leo’s profession (sound sensitivity underwater). Emotional complexity arises from betrayal by a father figure who also trained him. Risk-taking in using fear as tactical advantage feels fresh yet inevitable. Slight deduction: the orphanage backstory is familiar, though redeemed by the “firmly adaptive” resolution.</comment>
