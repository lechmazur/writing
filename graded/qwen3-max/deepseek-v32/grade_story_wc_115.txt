<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Alex’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his skepticism, fatigue, and drive to “appraise” are embodied in micro-choices like listening to the radio and interpreting the valve wheel. Mara’s confession creates relational pressure that alters his stance, and his final act of speaking to the ghosts earns a credible endurance. However, his emotional shift lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; the transition from skeptic to witness feels slightly smoothed, missing the grit of true internal conflict under duress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the ghost shift ends not through belief but through witnessed acknowledgment, reweighting “truth” as moral accountability. The causal chain—radio clue → valve recognition → confrontation → spectral pause—is tight, with the beaded wheel as a persistent constraint. Cost is legible in the “lighter hush” and Mara’s tears. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with psychic calls functioning as memory shards that culminate in earned stasis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The abandoned tunnel and mill function as more than backdrop—the rusted door, dripping water, and cold air directly channel Alex’s movement and mood. The beaded valve wheel qualifies as micro-setting, constraining interpretation and charging the climax. Sensory detail (rust, wet stone, hum) is selective and POV-filtered, avoiding white-room syndrome. Only narrowly misses 9+ because the train tunnel’s spatial logic isn’t fully leveraged beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—weighing the “swallowed truth”—is signaled early and deepens when the radio caller echoes the valve detail, forcing Alex to act. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to interpret, move, speak. The cost—emotional burden lifted, silence lightened—is felt, though not physically dramatized. Under an Accumulative lens, the tightening via layered clues (confession + radio + vision) sufficiently reweights the moral stake without overreach.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: truth as weight, memory as haunting, responsibility as repair. The beaded valve’s recurrence shifts from object to symbol to witness without overt moralizing. Final image—wheel left behind, static holding other stories—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: some truths need only attention, not faith. Avoids sentimentality by grounding epiphany in tactile history and radio-static ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable, third-person limited with a perceptual signature tuned to industrial decay and skeptical inquiry. Voice modulates rhythmically—longer sentences for reflection, clipped phrases during tension. Prose avoids filter-verb stacks and maintains lexicon consistency (“appraise,” “reckless,” “drowsy alertness”). Minor deduction: the psychic radio host’s voice bleeds into narration slightly, softening focalization purity at one beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “fatigue and hyper-awareness mingling”). Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. One slight overwriting: “shadows seemed to move” leans generic amid otherwise precise imagery. Otherwise, line-level craft supports momentum without obscuring causality or dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms ghost-story tropes through a skeptic’s methodical lens—psychic radio as archival tool, haunting as collective memory. The beaded valve wheel is a fresh, irreplaceable artifact that grounds the supernatural in labor history. Risk-taking (radio-as-clue system) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final resonance—truth resting after appraisal—feels inevitable yet surprising, anchored in specific industrial trauma rather than generic eeriness.</comment>
