<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arvid’s motivation—decoding the stranger’s final gesture—is rooted in his eccentric solitude and manifests through embodied, specific choices (handling the Edelweiss, interpreting calloused hands). His internal contradiction between detachment and compelled empathy drives micro-decisions that feel authentic. The borrowed-memory device risks epiphany, but it’s grounded in tactile sensation (“taste of alpine frost”) and tied to a visible cost: his isolation is irrevocably pierced. However, the transition from passive observer to intuitive decoder lacks a clear psychological pivot, slightly undermining the causality of his transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Arvid’s serene certainty at dawn reconfigures his role from witness to keeper of a bridged story, with the cost being the end of his untroubled solitude. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the Edelweiss motif deepens through repeated handling, and memories intensify without causal breaks. Orientation is flawless by line 3 (“nautical twilight,” “opal dock,” “lighthouse keeper”). The only flaw: the constable’s uncritical acceptance strains plausibility, though it serves thematic resonance over realism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The opal dock isn’t backdrop—it glows, muffles, and anchors perception; its luminous mist evolves from veil to “luminous blanket,” mirroring Arvid’s shift from observer to participant. The Edelweiss functions as micro-setting, its brittle stem constraining Arvid’s method (touch = memory). Sensory hierarchy reflects his keeper’s focus: barnacled legs, salt-lint pockets, alpine frost taste. Every detail filters through his professional solitude, avoiding tourist cataloging while charging the final image with iridescent specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decoding the void—tightens when Arvid chooses intuitive investigation over passive waiting, narrowing options to emotional risk. The deepening occurs when borrowed memories force him to carry Emil’s story, foreclosing his prior isolation. Cost is legible: “no longer just a witness” implies permanent vulnerability. Escalation stems from Arvid’s agency (handling the flower twice), though the storm memory arrives conveniently—luck complicates but doesn’t resolve, satisfying lens rules.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the Edelweiss as vessel: fidelity persists beyond death, and isolation can be breached by empathetic attention. The ending offers non-literal resolution—Arvid’s certainty bridges gaps not through facts but shared humanity—repricing the lighthouse’s purpose from warning to witness. Ambiguity lingers (How? Why him?), but complexity is earned via concrete particulars (woodcarver, chalet, vow). No moralizing; resonance flows from the flower’s journey from mountain token to sea-borne sacrament.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is masterfully controlled—single, close third with Arvid’s perceptual signature (noticing barnacles, wool quality, light shifts). Voice modulates rhythmically: short clauses for shock (“heart hammering”), lyrical flow for memories (“mournful stream”). Diction stays within keeper’s lexicon (“felted,” “sodden,” “void”), avoiding register drift. The prose embodies his quiet intensity, with syntax tightening during memory surges—zero head-hopping, zero filter-verb stacks, pure focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “milky, iridescent planks glowing softly” does triple duty (setting, mood, character perception). Sentences vary rhythmically, with paragraph cuts serving emotional beats (kitchen shock → dock return). One flaw: “borrowed memory” appears twice in near-identical phrasing (shock vs. stream), a minor paraphrase loop. Otherwise, zero scaffold—every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot, with high information density and no purple prose muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise—lighthouse keeper receiving dead man’s mountain flower—feels fresh through specificity: opal dock, nautical twilight, Edelweiss as vow-token. Borrowed memories could feel gimmicky, but they’re constrained by tactile triggers and emotional cost. Risk-taking (lyric intuition over detective work) heightens stakes without gimmickry. However, the core concept echoes ghost-story tropes; originality lies in execution (Arvid’s quiet certainty) rather than radical novelty, preventing 9+.</comment>
