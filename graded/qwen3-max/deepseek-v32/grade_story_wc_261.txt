<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dr. Thorne’s motivation—reading scars as narrative—is embodied in every action, from watering the fern to descending the tunnel. His internal contradiction (seeking closure yet opening wounds) operates simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summary. The epiphany about scars as language feels earned, not diagnostic, and his final choice to listen rather than fix reconfigures his identity with palpable cost: he accepts perpetual openness over healing. No therapy-speak; emotion is rendered through tactile sensation (“roots straining,” “petrified root-ball”).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Aris realizes his scar isn’t a flaw but a receiver, reweighting the entire premise of healing. The causal chain is tight—surgery enables telepathy, which draws him to the coffee rings, which lead to the cellar, which reveals the buried miracle. Cost is legible in the final image: the hourglass flows again, but time is now calibrated to listening, not ending. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“tower at dawn”), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tower functions as micro-setting: its rings mirror planetary orbits and the root-ball’s structure, directly shaping Aris’s descent. The petrified root-ball chamber constrains the climax—it’s not just backdrop but the source of the telepathic signal. Sensory detail is selective and pressure-driven: dry soil, cool stone air, psychic murmurs against skin. The recurring objects (hourglass, mug rings) charge the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deciphering scars—is signaled early and deepens when Aris realizes his condition is reception, not pathology. The meaningful tightening occurs when he chooses to descend, narrowing options from passive observation to active communion. Cost is unmistakable: he trades the illusion of closure for lifelong attunement to planetary pain. Escalation is driven by his agency under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with each sensory layer (fern, rings, root) intensifying the pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: scars are not wounds to erase but languages to learn. The final image—Aris leaving a new coffee ring while listening—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: understanding replaces resolution. No moralizing; resonance arises from the fern’s hum, the flowing sand, the stains as maps. The displaced miracle reframes damage as continuity, embracing complexity without false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Aris notices patterns others miss (rings as orbits, thirst as chorus), and syntax modulates with his state—longer, lyrical sentences during revelation, fragmented urgency during descent. POV remains tightly controlled; no head-hopping. Voice is consistent, with diction rooted in a historian’s precision (“scoured,” “petrified,” “calibration”) that never slips into academic register. The prose-as-character principle holds: rhythm mirrors his shifting consciousness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density (“meteor hush,” “mineral-slow memory”). Minor overwriting in the fern’s “vertiginous chorus of thirst” slightly strains metaphor coherence, but it’s purposeful and paid off. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors thematic resolution. One near-redundancy (“displaced miracle” repeated) costs 0.1, but clarity at closure remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of neural graft, sentient botany, and astronomical ruin feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes (buried secrets, miraculous trees) are grounded in specific, tactile detail—the root-ball as chamber, coffee rings as cartography. Risk-taking (telepathy with plants, non-healing closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The emotional truth—listening as intimacy with damage—avoids abstraction through concrete acts: watering, prying, palm on petrified wood.</comment>
