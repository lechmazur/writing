<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s deafness and grief are embodied with specificity—her tactile perception of vibration, numb chest, and tears of recognition avoid diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (carrying the needle, placing hands on the horn) reveal a hierarchy of values: silence over sound, feeling over numbness. Corin’s faded hearing mirrors her condition without caricature, and their silent understanding deepens stakes. The final thaw is earned through prior causality: the needle’s repair, the backward song, and her willingness to feel.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara reclaims feeling not through noise but through “a filament of hush,” with visible cost—the years of frozen grief cracked by quiet pressure. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via layered vibrations, rustling leaves, and mirrored hush until the filament emerges. Anchors (who, where, when) are clear by line 30; the cavern setting constrains the ritual. The broken needle’s repair and backward phonograph mechanics shape tactics and charge the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The drum maker’s cavern functions as micro-setting: damp stone echoes, workbench tools, and phonograph horn all constrain action and charge the climax. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—vibrations read by fingertips, silver filament gleaming, dry leaves skittering—filtered through Elara’s deafness. The environment evolves: entrance rustle → interior hush → post-catharsis “tender resonance.” Final image of leaves as “vivid texture” ties setting to internal shift, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled early and tightened through the backward song ritual, which narrows options to tactile listening. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she chooses the needle, the cavern, the hands-on horn. Cost is unmistakable: years of frozen grief yield only to the “gentle pressure” of silence, paid in tears and vulnerability. The filament of hush reweights the stake from seeking sound to embracing absence, with no coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: silence as healing, not emptiness. The “filament of hush” reweights sound itself—not as auditory input but as topography of tremors—and offers a non-literal answer to grief: feeling returns through absence, not noise. Recurring images (needle, leaves, hush) shift meaning: broken → whole, rustle → texture, numbness → calm. No moralizing; resonance arises from Elara’s embodied experience, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Elara notices vibrations, textures, light—not sound. Syntax modulates with pressure: short, tactile phrases during the phonograph sequence (“fingertips reading the vibrations”) contrast with lyrical flow in reflection. POV remains tightly controlled; no head-hopping despite dual characters. Voice is consistent, poetic without pretension, and the absence of dialogue (replaced by signing and mirrored hush) serves the theme flawlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is coherent (“canvas of vibrations,” “topography of tremors”) and peaks without muddle. Minor overwriting in “cascade of inverted rhythms” slightly dilutes propulsion, but rhythm varies naturally overall. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; closure image (“silent song that would never break”) is precise and resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise transforms tropes: a deaf music teacher seeking silence subverts expectations of sound-as-healing. The “backward recorded songs” method and “filament of hush” concept feel fresh yet inevitable. Emotional truth anchors ingenuity—Elara’s grief isn’t cured but reconfigured through tactile silence. Risk-taking (lyric structure, minimal dialogue, abstract concept) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the final image feels both surprising and deeply earned.</comment>
