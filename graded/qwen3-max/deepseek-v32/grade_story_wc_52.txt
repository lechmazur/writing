<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marta’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her grief manifests through tactile engagement with ash wood, not diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (hollowing a channel “to make room,” not to imprison) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: enduring absence while refusing to be drowned by it. The contradiction between “he was here and gone” operates simultaneously in her actions, not as alternating summaries. Her motivation—to harvest lessons, not forget—drives every deliberate shaving, making her final re-engagement with the gouge feel earned, not tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Marta accepts dual truths without fracture, crystallizing time into form. Cost is legible in the “ghost limb” sensation and the chair that “will never again bear his weight”—a permanent void given finite vessel. The kettle’s boil provides rhythmic structure, and the rain-beaded skylight anchors orientation early. Every image accumulates toward the final Charged Poise: hands moving with purpose through absence, peace “earned through weathering.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft functions as both setting and micro-setting: rain distorts the sky, steam clouds the window, wet glass becomes “fractured silver”—all constraining perception and mood. The ash wood, gouge, and kettle are handled with tactile specificity, each shaping Marta’s choices. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: scent of “dry autumn leaves,” cool grain, kettle’s “low whisper.” Crucially, the environment charges the final image—the loft’s “rust-hued peace” emerges from weathered surfaces and emotional residue, not postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—containing immense grief without being consumed—is signaled early and deepens through Marta’s carving method. The tightening occurs when she hollows a channel “not with sadness, but to make room,” foreclosing passive drowning in favor of active containment. Agency is clear: her hands move with purpose, turning pain into a “tangible thing you could put down and pick back up.” Cost is felt in the ghost limb, the empty chair, and the discipline required to hold paradox—visible, persistent, and woven into every action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of carving, memory, and ritual—not stated but embodied. The central question—how to live with irrevocable loss—receives a non-literal answer: build a structure sturdy enough to hold it. The recurring image of the carving shifts from blank to “record of this hour,” then to “tool for living,” reweighting earlier material without moralizing. Final resonance lies in “crystallized time” casting “new patterns on the wall”—a quiet assertion that grief, shaped, can refract light.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered entirely through Marta’s perceptual signature: noticing grain, steam, rain streaks, silence as “a new animal.” Voice modulates with emotional intensity—syntax tightens during carving (“She hollowed a deep channel”), breathes during reflection. Diction remains within her plausible lexicon (“rust-hued peace,” “stubborn, like him”), avoiding therapy-speak or abstraction. No head-hopping; even Leo exists only through her memory, voice, and absence—fully integrated with thematic and emotional aims.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“silence was a new animal,” “ghost limb”) and paid off in closure. Minor overwriting appears in “hauntingly practical” used twice—slightly redundant—but doesn’t obscure causality. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence, and concrete verbs (“curl,” “pierce,” “stretch”) anchor abstraction. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; the final line’s propulsion (“one deliberate shaving at a time”) echoes the opening’s discipline, closing the arc cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The widow-of-a-lion-tamer trope is transformed through specificity: grief isn’t roared but carved into abstract form; courage isn’t spectacle but “quiet, constant force.” The “here and gone” paradox avoids cliché by being physically enacted in negative space and hollowed channels. Originality lies in the alchemy of turning pain into a handheld object—practical, not monumental. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation pays off: the story trusts silence, rain, and wood grain to carry emotional weight, resisting exposition or resolution. Vision feels singular, not templated.</comment>
