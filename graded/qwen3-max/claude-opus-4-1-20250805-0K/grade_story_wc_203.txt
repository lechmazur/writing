<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his trauma, skill, and moral burden cohere in micro-choices like analyzing dust or winding the spring. His motivation intensifies credibly from curiosity to obligation, culminating in a renunciation of silence with tangible cost. The ghost’s reconfiguration from sequined illusion to guilt-ridden truth reveals layered emotional stakes without therapy-speak. Final choice feels earned by prior causality and carries the weight of his grandmother’s legacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mainspring barrel’s warmth and the ghosts’ release reframe systemic corruption as repairable through witness. The Causal lens holds—each discovery (floorboard journal, ceiling cache) tightens pressure toward exposure. Cost is legible in Marcus’s acceptance of burden (“weightless burden”) and the dead’s earned peace. Fluorescent’s final buzz-turned-off crystallizes Charged Poise: truth requires darkness to be seen.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned ticket office functions as micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: dust patterns guide discovery, ceiling tiles hide evidence, spatial choreography remains coherent. Sensory detail (buzzing fluorescent, spiraling motes, yellowed pages) is selective, tactile, and filtered through Marcus’s professional attention. The mainspring barrel and Teresa’s costume collar charge the final image. Environment directly shapes tactics and closure—no white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—exposing institutionalized neglect—is signaled early and deepens via Marcus’s discovery of escalating evidence. Agency drives escalation: his “engagement” with dust and floorboards narrows options toward public exposure. Cost is unmistakable: inheriting his grandmother’s silenced crusade and bearing witness for the dead. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his skillful observation under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: broken systems demand human repair, and silence is complicity. Subtext thrives in gesture—the ghost’s flicker, the spring’s whisper—and avoids moralizing. Final image reweights “cracks in the facade” not as failure but as entry points for truth. No tidy resolution; complexity endures in Marcus’s grim smile and the unresolved reporters’ role.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, with perceptual signature rooted in Marcus’s technician gaze (“analyzing dust accumulation patterns”). Voice modulates rhythm under pressure—shorter sentences during discovery, lyrical cadence at closure. No head-hopping; ghosts remain external phenomena filtered through his senses. Diction stays within his plausible lexicon; even metaphors (“dying wasp,” “yellow as old teeth”) feel character-earned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “cables singing,” “weightless burden,” “honest darkness” do thematic and atmospheric work. Minor figurative density in the climax (“web of neglect,” “tombs waiting to happen”) slightly risks overwriting but pays off in closure. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary. Final line’s “whispered promise” ties back to grandmother’s spring with resonant economy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story and institutional critique—ghosts as witnesses to mechanical betrayal, not personal trauma. Elevator technician’s skill transforms passive haunting into active investigation. Risk-taking (bureaucratic horror via dust analysis) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight: the mainspring as both tool and heirloom reconfigures “repair” as moral duty.</comment>
