<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Margaret’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her grief, agency, and transformation manifest through tactile carving choices, not therapy-speak. The “hauntingly practical” precision of her knife work reveals how Thomas lives on in her hands, not as memory but as altered capability. Her final decision to teach workshops emerges organically from the carving act, foreclosing isolation with visible cost: she carries forward, not moves on. No diagnostic labels; emotion arises through grain, steam, rain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the clock face without hands redefines time itself as crystallized presence, not linear loss. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure intensifies via sensory density (rain, wood scent, kettle pitch) until the final image reweights all prior material. Cost is legible in the roughed-out artifact and the irreversible shift from private mourning to public teaching. Every beat tightens around the central stake: how to hold love after death.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges every choice—the limited carving time dictated by the boiling kettle, the amber light shaping perception, the spatial choreography between bench and hotplate. Sensory detail is filtered through Margaret’s carver-artist POV: she notices grain, steam, shifting shadows, not generic “atmosphere.” The ash wood and skylight jointly charge the final image, making setting inseparable from theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to honor love after death—is signaled early and deepens via Margaret’s carving choices under temporal pressure. Agency manifests in renunciation (rejecting the lion) and creation (the handless clock), each narrowing options with felt cost. The escalation is driven by protagonist action: opening the box, choosing the form, deciding to teach. Coincidence never resolves; even the tiger’s turn is backstory, not plot device.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through particulars: the unfinished carving, the absent hands, the “moments refusing to be ordered.” No moralizing—insight arises from wood grain and kettle whistles. The final image offers a non-literal answer: love persists not in duration but in form, like fossil or artifact. Subtext thrives in what’s unsaid—the tiger’s offstage violence contrasts with Margaret’s quiet, precise creation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is singular, controlled, and perceptually specific—Margaret notices “amber afternoon light,” “sawdust in his beard,” “rust-hued peace.” Syntax modulates with pressure: short, purposeful clauses during carving; lyrical cadence in reflection. No head-hopping; focalization remains tightly bound to her sensory and emotional field. The prose embodies her “hauntingly practical” nature—every image serves revelation, not decoration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid—each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme without scaffold. Figurative language is precise (“rain beaded the glass overhead like tears that wouldn’t fall”) and never muddled. Rhythm varies naturally: staccato during carving, flowing in reflection. Zero paraphrase loops; high information density (e.g., “crystallized time, perfect and complete even after its subject vanishes” does triple duty).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms widowhood tropes through specificity: grief isn’t wept but carved; legacy isn’t memorialized but taught. The “clock without hands” is a fresh, inevitable synthesis of circus rings, wedding bands, and wood grain. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative texture over plot) heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Every detail—ash wood, kettle timing, lion tamer’s death—feels irreplaceable and coherently fused.</comment>
