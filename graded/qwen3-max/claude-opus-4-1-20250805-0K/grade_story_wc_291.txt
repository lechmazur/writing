<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sarah’s prosopagnosia and artistic method fuse into a coherent perceptual system that drives every action; her internal contradiction—seeking truth through absence—is embodied in tactile choices (e.g., wrapping the ribbon around her finger). Motivation intensifies logically from texture to pattern to killer-profile without diagnostic self-awareness. Final renunciation (“carrying seventeen proofs”) forecloses conventional justice with visible emotional cost, earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the killer’s identity reframed not as face but as “borrowed pieces,” reweighting all prior murders as acts of fractured unity. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each portrait deepens the pattern until the final image crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible in Sarah’s trembling hand and the vanished evidence’s irreplaceability. Orientation anchors instantly (“quarry,” “Detective Sarah Chen,” “morning mist”).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The quarry isn’t backdrop but active constraint: mist limits visibility (mirroring Sarah’s face blindness), stone grooves guide her descent, and spatial choreography centers the easel at calculated sight lines. The ribbon fragment—a micro-setting—charges the final image when pressed into the sketchbook. Every detail serves pressure or perception, avoiding white-room syndrome or sensory cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unmasking duality) tightens through Sarah’s agency: each portrait narrows the killer’s profile until the psychiatric hospital insight. Cost is felt in charcoal-dusted fingers and vanished evidence, altering tactics (she works from memory/texture). Escalation follows Accumulative lens—density increases until the eleventh portrait reveals “reunions,” forcing the final conceptual leap.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: wholeness through fragmentation, empathy via contradiction. No moralizing—insights arise from charcoal strokes and silk weaves. The ending reweights prior material (“seventeen contradictions stared back”) without stating a thesis, inviting reflection on how we “complete” ourselves through others’ divisions. Ambiguity lingers (killer’s fate unresolved) but complexity feels earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: Sarah notices texture over faces, charcoals by hardness, scarlet threads over features. Syntax modulates with pressure—measured clauses early, fragmented urgency during the final portrait. No head-hopping; focalization stays strictly within her tactile POV. Voice remains consistent even in lyric closure (“shadows held truth like cupped hands holding water”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “generous hands emerging from clenched fists” does triple duty (character, theme, image). Minor overwriting in “architecture of a shattered mind” slightly dilutes peak-beat clarity, but no loops or scaffold. Sentence variety supports rhythm—long descriptive strands early, staccato phrases during revelation (“These weren’t random killings; they were reunions.”).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms procedural tropes through a face-blind artist’s lens—originality lies in method (truth via negative space) and moral calculus (killer as healer of fragmentation). Risk-taking heightens stakes: the quarry setting and ribbon fragment aren’t decorative but causal. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; no template echoes, only specific, irreplaceable choices rooted in Sarah’s perception.</comment>
