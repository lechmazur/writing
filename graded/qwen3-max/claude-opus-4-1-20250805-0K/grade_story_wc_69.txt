<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Chen’s interiority is richly embodied—her “expectantly resigned” posture, tactile tracing of the rosette, and history of unlearning hatred feel lived-in, not diagnostic. Her final choice to entrust the zither emerges credibly from decades of teaching by subtraction, not declaration. Students’ return refracts her impact without flattening them into avatars; each carries distinct cultural instruments that shape their agency. The cost—retirement, program dissolution—is felt but transcended through collective action, avoiding tidy redemption.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the arts vanish not with institutional abandonment but when people cease gathering—reversed on-page by students’ arrival. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, deepening via layered instrumentation until the five modes coalesce. Cost is legible in Chen’s admission she knows only three modes and the zither’s impending storage; the final image of humming harmonies reweights silence as active listening. Every beat tightens toward this earned poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The velvet library functions as micro-setting: its sound-absorbing quality directly enables the fragile zither tones to be heard, constraining how music can emerge. Autumn isn’t backdrop but active metaphor—beauty from decay—mirroring the program’s end and rebirth through students. The rosette’s cranes shift from static inlay to implied motion through sound, charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear despite growing cast, anchored by the zither as focal object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving vanishing art through communal practice—is signaled early and deepens when students arrive to learn the modes. Chen’s agency drives escalation: her choice to teach despite incomplete knowledge catalyzes collaborative discovery. Cost is unmistakable—the university’s closure looms, the zither will be stored—but the group’s creation of new harmony forecloses despair with visible emotional and cultural price. Pressure accumulates texturally, not causally, fitting the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: “subtracting noise” isn’t preached but practiced as students layer instruments only after listening. The ending offers a non-literal answer—vanishing arts persist through adaptation, not preservation—reweighting the rosette from relic to relay. Silence as “presence of listening” avoids moralizing by being tested in scene. Complexity endures: authenticity is acknowledged (“not recreating authentic Chinese music”) yet transformation is honored.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV remains tightly focalized through Chen with controlled psychic distance; even group moments filter through her perception (“some gray-haired now”). Voice modulates with pressure—sparse syntax during resignation, lyrical density during playing—without losing coherence. Dialogue is minimal but distinct: Marcus’s directness, Yuki’s resolve, Dmitri’s silent contribution. No head-hopping; collective “choir” at end reads as poetic extension, not POV breach.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: “velvet library absorbed sound like autumn leaves absorb rain” establishes texture and stakes in one stroke. Figurative language is consistent (absorption, flight, stillness) without muddle. Minor scaffold in “braiding diverse voices” recurs meaningfully, not repetitively. Final paragraph’s “humming five different modes that somehow, impossibly, harmonized” earns its lyricism through prior dramatization—no purple excess, just resonant closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms the “last keeper of dying art” trope by making preservation communal and adaptive, not solitary or archival. The zither’s rosette—specific in design (five cranes, five modes)—grounds abstraction in tangible heritage. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative jam session as climax) heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Originality lies in showing transmission as co-creation across diasporas, not fidelity to origin—a fresh inflection on cultural continuity.</comment>
