<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s silent empathy and Thomas’s frozen grief are embodied with precision—her spiraling calm contrasts his hunched tension, and their micro-choices (mirror handling, shutter manipulation) reveal values without exposition. The boy’s emotional shift feels earned through sensory engagement rather than therapy-speak. One flaw: Mira borders on archetype, though her actions ground her. Final renunciation of silence-as-dogma is credible and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Thomas reweights his grandmother’s death through starlight reflections, transforming silence from failure into vessel. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via shutter patterns until the final image crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible in Thomas’s dissolved secret and Mira’s continued solitude. No causality breaks; every beat feeds the closing insight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, rain puddles, and canal house aren’t backdrop—they’re active tools. Puddles reflect stars, shutters modulate light, the dental mirror becomes telescope: environment constrains and enables every turn. Sensory hierarchy shifts with emotion (cool planks → starlight glints), and spatial choreography stays crisp. Final image of stars carried seaward charges closure with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unspoken love needing validation—is clear early and tightens when Mira opens shutters, forcing Thomas to confront memory-as-testimony. Escalation is driven by Mira’s agency under Accumulative pressure: each shutter pattern deepens his understanding. Cost is felt (his tears, lighter step) but slightly abstract; a concrete forfeiture (e.g., leaving a token behind) would heighten it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as fuller than speech, darkness as necessary for starlight. Avoids moralizing—the dental mirror’s reuse shows, never tells. Final image reweights the premise without stating it: stars as spoken secrets. Ambiguity lingers (Will Thomas speak now? Can Mira ever?), but resonance is undeniable through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct—Mira notices light angles, Thomas fixates on weight and breath. Syntax mirrors calm vs. tension: long, fluid sentences for her; clipped observation for him early on. No head-hopping; single POV maintained through embodied focalization. Voice modulates naturally under pressure, especially in the mirror-weaving sequence where rhythm mimics lapping water.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—“spiralingly calm movements / like water circling a drain in reverse” exemplifies layered metaphor that pays off. Minor overwriting in “stillwater tension” phrase, but no loops or scaffold. Sentence variety supports emotional arc, and paragraph cuts align with knowledge shifts. One near-redundancy (“shadows darker than any night” / “darkness so complete”) slightly dulls momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: silent pedagogy via optical physics (shutters, mirror, puddles) transforms cliché “unsaid goodbyes.” Risk-taking (no dialogue, abstract concept made tactile) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors universals—cobalt dock, dental mirror—not generic. Feels inevitable in hindsight; removing any core element (e.g., shutters) would collapse the lesson’s mechanics.</comment>
