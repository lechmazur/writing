<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elsa’s reticence is embodied in micro-choices (e.g., cracking voice, steady hands) and her final decision emerges from consistent traits—quiet endurance transformed into active guardianship. Jonas’s ghostly presence avoids sentimentality; his flickering form and unspoken plea feel earned, not expositional. The sea glass functions as both object and emotional conduit, grounding Elsa’s internal shift in tactile specificity. Her motivation—to bottle safety for others—arises organically from lived solitude, not diagnostic self-awareness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elsa’s acceptance of the lamp reweights isolation into purpose, with visible cost (she now stands alone permanently). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—pressure builds through sensory detail, stone cairns, letters—and culminates in a Charged Poise ending where options crystallize (“I am here”). The lamp’s relighting isn’t mechanical but intention-driven, tied to prior causality (her history of watching the light). Cost is legible in the ghosts’ tears and her irreversible commitment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse, sea, and stones aren’t backdrop but active constraints: the dead lamp forces night navigation, the cairns dictate understanding, the lantern room exhales “something older, colder.” The sea glass—a micro-setting—charges the climax by pulsing with memory and enabling the lamp’s reignition. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elsa’s profession (crunch of beach, phosphorescent foam) and emotional state (cold stairs, warm glass). Final image of stacked stones on the gallery deck ties setting directly to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—confronting loneliness that consumes—is signaled early via letters and deepens when Elsa realizes she’s been chosen *because* of her solitude. The meaningful tightening occurs at the cairns: “danger,” “remember safety,” “protect” narrow her choice from observer to guardian. Cost is felt in her irreversible role shift and the ghosts’ dependence. Escalation is driven by Elsa’s agency—she climbs, interprets, chooses—not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme—loneliness vs. purposeful solitude—emerges through concrete particulars: stone messages, snuffed lamp, sea glass as bottled safety. No moralizing; insight arises when Elsa understands her quiet nature is a gift, not a flaw. Final image reweights all prior isolation: stacking stones becomes an act of communion, transforming haunting into care. Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and the ghosts’ weeping—resonant without explanation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-limited, filtered through Elsa’s perceptual signature—she notices gulls, wave rhythms, stone patterns, not abstract dread. Voice modulates under pressure: short sentences during dock approach, lyrical cadence in lantern room. Syntax mirrors her mind—measured, observant, then decisive. No head-hopping; even Jonas’s dialogue (“lips didn’t move”) stays within her sensory frame. Prose rhythm accelerates toward climax then settles into dawn’s charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “phosphorescent foam,” “stairs seemed to breathe,” “tears falling like sea glass” avoid purple excess by serving atmosphere and character. Minor overwriting in “bottled safety you carry for others”—slightly abstract amid otherwise concrete diction—but redeemed by immediate tactile follow-up (sea glass warming). No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot, character, or mood. Final paragraph’s stone message lands with earned simplicity, no redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms haunted lighthouse trope through specificity: keepers aren’t evil but trapped by loneliness; the haunting is collective yearning, not malice. Sea glass as vessel for memory, stone language as supply code—these details feel lived, not decorative. Risk-taking (ghosts as sympathetic, lamp fueled by intention) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision coheres: solitude as both wound and weapon, light as shared responsibility. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
