<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lila’s motivation—driven by personal loss and professional obsession—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies credibly. Her micro-choices (lying to her supervisor, initiating self-archival) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest through tactile detail (e.g., the warm mission patch). The final renunciation is earned by prior causality: her father’s fate mirrors her own path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “We’re not missing. We’re archived” reframes deletion as preservation, with Lila’s transformation into Pattern User 8625 embodying irreversible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via recurring numbers, corrupted data, and ghost profiles until the final cadence shift crystallizes meaning. Orientation is immediate (“between floors… maintenance elevator”), and the pattern pays off cohesively at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The archive functions as both setting and micro-setting: obsolete servers constrain access, the mission patch charges the final image, and spatial choreography (towers, substrata, echo of songs) remains coherent. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—RGB values, voice message gaps, ingredient measurements—all filtered through Lila’s data-archaeologist POV. The environment directly enables and pressures her choices, culminating in her self-compression into the system.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding where deleted files (and people) go—is signaled early and tightens when Lila discovers the shadow network. Her agency drives escalation: each decryption (recipe coordinates, like-patterns) narrows options until she chooses self-archival. Cost is legible: she forfeits physical existence to join the compressed. Coincidence complicates (4827 anomalies) but never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: digital immortality as involuntary preservation, not erasure. The final line—“they go home”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting deletion as belonging. Subtext thrives in gesture (tracing the patch) and implication (ghost profiles communicating through likes). No moralizing; ambiguity lingers (Is this salvation or entrapment?), yet the emotional aftereffect is concrete and haunting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled first-person limited; perceptual signature is distinct (noticing metadata anomalies, interpreting data as language). Voice modulates under pressure—syntax tightens during discovery beats (“Four pounds, eight ounces…”), then expands lyrically at closure. No head-hopping; diction stays within Lila’s plausible lexicon (technical but poetic). Elision (e.g., skipping steps in decoding) is purposeful and paid off through pattern recognition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: sentences vary rhythmically, paragraph cuts serve emotional beats, and figurative language is restrained (“graveyard of deleted profiles”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Minor register drift in “mathematical harmony” slightly jars but doesn’t obscure clarity. Final image (“mission patch and recurring numbers”) crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise transforms familiar tropes (digital ghosts, missing persons) through specific, grounded mechanics: data compression as consciousness dispersal, communication via cached likes. The synthesis of Apollo-X static modulation with social media archaeology feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk-taking (protagonist choosing erasure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision is singular—voice, concept, and closure cohere as an artistic stance on digital mortality.</comment>
