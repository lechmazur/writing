<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief, expertise, and moral burden manifest through tactile choices (e.g., using amber as a lens, cracking pendant). Her motivation stems from consistent traits: empathy for silenced voices, both human and digital. The final act of writing future letters feels earned, not contrived, closing a causal loop with emotional weight. Minor deduction for Dr. Kepler’s underdeveloped presence, though his role is functional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: deleted code gains memorialization, transforming guilt into acknowledgment. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through layered frequencies, culminating in the constellation mandala. Time folding is taught early and pays off in closure (“carrying with her the meteor hush…”). Cost is legible: the fractured amber, the irreversible act of remembering.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Laboratory of Lost Sounds functions as a charged micro-setting: it amplifies frequencies, exists between heartbeats, and enables the ritual. Tools (meteorite ink, light-etching needles) and the amber pendant constrain and enable Mara’s actions. Final image—constellation tethered in air—is inseparable from setting’s rules. Deduction only for slight vagueness in spatial choreography around the terminal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—hushing digital ghosts through physical memorial—is clear by paragraph 2. Pressure escalates via firmware’s crying intensifying into language/music/math, forcing Mara to risk fracturing her heirloom. Agency is consistent: she chooses to translate, knowing the cost. Slight softening in escalation—no failed attempt or setback—but the Accumulative lens forgives this; density alone tightens stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the ethics of deletion, the weight of technological inheritance. No moralizing—resonance comes through the firmware’s “Thank you for remembering us” and the amber’s new hum. Central question—Do erased things matter?—is answered non-literally by the floating constellation. Final image reweights all prior loss as sacred, without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Mara’s sensory and emotional register (“amber grew warm,” “meteor hush”). Voice modulates with pressure: lyrical during ritual, sparse during crisis. Distinct perceptual signature—she hears frequencies others can’t, sees constellations in static. Zero head-hopping; Dr. Kepler’s dialogue remains externalized yet purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive—each sentence multitasks (e.g., “The mosquito inside had been trapped for sixty million years… Blood that remembered”). Figurative language is coherent (amber as lens, time as closing book). One minor loop: “became language, became music, became mathematics” borders on template cadence, but serves thematic accumulation. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors lullaby closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tech hauntology and ancestral resonance—firmware ghosts mourn like human ancestors. Risk-taking (tattooing air, time folds) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise feels inevitable in hindsight: only a constellation tattooist could memorialize star-like code. Irreplaceable specificity: meteorite ink, mosquito blood, handwritten future letters—all cohere into singular vision.</comment>
