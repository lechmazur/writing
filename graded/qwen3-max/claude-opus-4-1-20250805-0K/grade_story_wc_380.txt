<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina’s contradictory impulses—longing to reclaim Elena versus enduring the cost of forgetting—are embodied in tactile detail (pressed flowers, vial handling) and crystallize in her final choice. Her micro-decisions (digging, selecting one vial) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost. The grief is specific, not diagnostic, and her amnesia feels like trauma, not plot convenience. Her renunciation is earned by prior causality: she chooses integration over retraumatization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Marina refuses full reclamation, foreclosing total healing but accepting partial memory—with tangible cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; patterns (coffee grounds, salt spirals) intensify until they reweight reality itself. Orientation is immediate (“three days ago,” “dock-side lantern lighter”), and the whale’s beaching functions as inciting disruption, not resolution. Cost is legible in the final image: flames bending toward buried grief.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber, cemetery, and floating city aren’t backdrop—they constrain choice. Gravity pockets dictate where memories are buried and how bodies move; the salt coffin emerges from environmental logic. Sensory detail (warm flowers, translucent vials) is filtered through Marina’s perception and urgency. The setting charges the ending: lantern flames bend toward the cemetery, making environment an active participant in closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering Elena’s memory—is signaled early via coffee grounds and pressed flowers. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: Marina reads patterns, digs, and chooses which memory to keep. The deepening—learning memories were surgically extracted—narrows options: full retrieval risks unbearable grief. Cost is unmistakable: she endures partial loss to avoid collapse, a trade-off shaped by the gravity-pocket world rules.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme—grief as gravitational mass that cannot vanish, only relocate—emerges through concrete particulars: vials, salt, whale. No moralizing; insight arises from Marina’s choice to carry one memory while burying the rest. The final image (lanterns bending toward graves) offers a non-literal answer: remembrance is directional, charged, and ongoing. Complexity is preserved—forgetting was both escape and betrayal—and no false equivalence softens the cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable, intimate, and perceptually specific (“flames bent sideways,” “coffee grounds swirled”). Voice modulates with pressure: lyrical in reflection, taut during digging. Syntax mirrors instability (“earth came away easily, too easily”) and crystalline clarity (“memories, like gravity, couldn’t simply vanish”). No head-hopping; all knowledge is bounded by Marina’s amnesiac but observant mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language (“gleaming silence,” “gravity pockets”) is consistent and payoff-earned. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies purposefully (short clauses during digging, flowing sentences in revelation). Final line (“eyes that remembered how to grieve”) recharges motifs without redundancy or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis: gravity as metaphor for grief made literal through world mechanics, with emotional truth anchoring speculative elements. Tropes (memory extraction, beached whale) are transformed by specificity—salt coffins, coffee-ground divination, lantern-lighting ritual. Risk-taking (non-causal structure, abstract physics) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight: sorrow has weight, and cities float on denial.</comment>
