<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s ambition, olfactory sensitivity, and impatience are embodied in micro-choices (e.g., sketching as meditation, dew collection) that evolve into earned stillness. Her internal contradiction—rushing vs. rootedness—is dramatized through action, not summary. The final endurance (“breathing deeply despite her sensitive nose”) forecloses her old self with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through sensory perception and gesture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mira’s rooted understanding replaces ambition, with cost felt in her relinquished haste. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of sketches, scent, sway intensifies until the bloom crystallizes meaning. “Turning of the tide’s thought” signals deepening, not coincidence. Cost is legible in her transformed posture and the villagers’ witness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Whisperwood’s treetop village isn’t backdrop—it constrains choice (suspended garden, rope bridges) and charges closure (swaying = stillness). The corpse flower’s stench and lightning-struck soil are tactile, irreplaceable details. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mira’s olfactory POV; mist “like steam from a witch’s cauldron” merges atmosphere with character bias without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mastering wisdom through patience—is signaled early and tightens when Mira shifts from grasping to sketching. Her agency drives escalation: choosing slow observation over speed alters tactics (dew watering, fungal detection). Cost is felt in mocked isolation and embodied in her final breath amid stench. Coincidence never resolves; the bloom responds only to her earned attunement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the corpse flower’s “not death but transformation” reframes decay as communication. Final image—Mira swaying, rooted—answers the central question (how to be still in motion) without moralizing. Recurring sketches reweight ancestry as living practice, not nostalgia. Ambiguity lingers (is wisdom passive or active?), but stance is clear.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-limited, filtered through Mira’s olfactory and artistic perception. Voice modulates rhythmically: short clauses during tension (“Her drawings were no longer static”), lyrical flow in reflection. Syntax mirrors village sway; diction stays within herbalist lexicon (“undercurrent of wisdom” feels earned, not academic). No head-hopping; Thorne’s lines carry his “wildflower hush” idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “putrid-sweet promise,” “world balanced between night and day” fuse image and concept. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary organically. One near-overreach: “smell its dreams” risks abstraction but pays off in thematic resonance. Closure line (“rooted at last in understanding”) avoids sentimentality through concrete antecedents (sketches, sway, stench).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms “chosen one” tropes via specificity: wisdom as olfactory attunement, ancestry as sketching tradition. Corpse flower’s biology grounds metaphor in real stakes (seven-year bloom, carrion beetles). Risk-taking (lyric structure, sensory POV) heightens theme without gimmickry. Fresh synthesis: serenity as motion-rootedness, not stillness.</comment>
