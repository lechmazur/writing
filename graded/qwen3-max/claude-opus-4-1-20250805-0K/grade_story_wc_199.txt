<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is richly embodied—her tingling fingertips, mossy joy, and silver-threaded hair reflect transformation rooted in micro-choices (stacking cairns, prodding the speck). Her motivation intensifies from dutiful sorting to active interpretation, with clear cost: she abandons protocol for ancestral intuition. The final change feels earned through generational echoes and tactile ritual, not epiphany. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through action and sensory detail.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira becomes a “translator of the vertical world,” crystallizing options between ascent and return. Cost is legible—the dissolution of the moonstone into her skin, her transformed eyes—and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout. Orientation is immediate (“In the Ashen Skyborne Arbor…”), and the leaf-message crescendo tightens pressure without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The arbor functions as both macro- and micro-setting: petrified branches constrain movement, ash-gray bark shifts under moss, and seed bowls dictate spatial choreography. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mira’s focus—humming seeds, tingling light, fractal moss—never touristy. The environment actively charges the final image: moss grows wherever she touches, transforming the arbor’s palette as her purpose manifests.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decoding the earth’s plea to the skyborne trees—is signaled early and deepens when leaves reveal letters. Mira’s agency drives escalation: her choice to build cairns (not report the speck) triggers the upward-falling leaves and final revelation. Cost is felt (her irreversible transformation), though the “choice approaching” remains collective, slightly diffusing personal stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: forgotten seeds, moonstone dust, and leaf-letters coalesce into a meditation on memory as bridge between rupture and return. The ending reweights prior material—the “first dance” between earth and tree—without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers (are the messages warnings or promises?), yet resonance is undeniable in Mira’s mossy delight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exquisite: Mira notices shimmer, song, and pattern, filtering the world through a seed-sorter’s precision. Syntax modulates with intensity—long, lyrical sentences during reflection; sharp fragments (“She prodded… it rang”) at climax. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained (she interprets, never omnisciently declares). Voice remains consistent even as her perception expands.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush but controlled—figurative density serves atmosphere without muddling causality. Minor overwriting in “symphony only she could fully comprehend” slightly dilutes closure’s punch. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. No loops or scaffold, though “mossy delight” borders on label-speak (saved by immediate embodiment in fractal growth).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise transforms skybound arbors and seed lore into a fresh mythos where gravity rebels and memory is cartographic. Specificity abounds: Windkeepers’ syllabic seeds, Glass Oak, moonstone as lunar tear. Risk-taking (upward-falling leaves, sentient bark) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular—eco-poetic yet urgent—not templated.</comment>
