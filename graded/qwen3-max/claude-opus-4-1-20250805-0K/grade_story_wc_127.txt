<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera’s interiority is vividly embodied—her static-charged hair, tactile interaction with amber, and emotional restraint reveal a character defined by professional discipline and private longing. Her renunciation of consuming the emotions (“never consume the merchandise”) is a micro-choice that crystallizes her moral code under pressure. The contradiction between her empathy and detachment feels lived-in, not diagnostic. Final endurance carries visible cost: she emerges bearing incomplete truths while denying herself wholeness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Vera exits the grotto with harvested half-truths, having foreclosed personal emotional fulfillment to serve clients’ needs—a stance reconfigured by dusk’s transformation window. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; emotional resonances layer like amber deposits, intensifying until the petal saturates. Cost is legible in the final image: “static electricity still tingled on her fingertips,” a sensory echo of denied completion. Every beat tightens around the central constraint—the grotto’s brief permeability at dusk.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The amber grotto functions as both setting and micro-setting: its molecular loosening at dusk directly enables Vera’s harvest and imposes a hard deadline. Sensory detail is selective and profession-filtered—she notices static, color shifts in the petal, resin textures—not tourist spectacle. The blotter petal and amber walls constrain choice (only partial emotions can be extracted) and charge the final image (petal tucked away, static on skin). No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography is precise: fingers on wall, steps climbed, chest pressed to petal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harvesting usable half-truths before the grotto seals—is signaled early and escalates through tactile urgency as static intensifies. Vera’s agency drives deepening: she chooses which emotions to capture based on client needs, resisting the pull to absorb them herself. The meaningful tightening occurs when she aligns the petal with her heartbeat to “fuse insight with empathy,” narrowing options to ethical precision. Cost is felt in the widower’s anticipated relief versus Vera’s ongoing emotional abstinence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: mercy lies in incompleteness, not wholeness. The final line—“incomplete truths, each one a small mercy in a world that often loved too sharply”—reweights the entire premise without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture: pressing petal to chest, refusing self-consumption, climbing into night. No platitudes; wisdom arises from the specificity of amber-trapped confessions and the blotter’s burgundy streaks. Ambiguity lingers: is this compassion or complicity?</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Vera’s sensory-professional lens (“fragrance chemist’s blotter petal,” “static electricity crackling”). Voice modulates with pressure: lyrical during observation (“pools of liquid gold”), taut during climax (“another minute before they would seal shut”). Syntax mirrors emotional tension—longer sentences for immersion, fragments for urgency (“There you are”). No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent: she reads emotions as scents, textures, colors.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “amber walls having absorbed centuries of visitors' confessions” compresses history into tactile presence. Figurative language is coherent—static as emotional conduit, petal darkening like photographic development. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor deduction for slight overuse of em-dashes in high-pressure beats, but rhythm remains varied and purposeful. Final line’s cadence (“loved too sharply”) delivers thematic resonance without flourish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise transforms emotion-dealing tropes via the amber grotto’s geologic time-scale and the ethics of partial truth. Originality lies in the mechanics: static discharge as emotional transduction, half-truths as marketable commodities. Every element feels irreplaceable—swap “blotter petal” for “vial” and the fragrance-chemist logic collapses. Bold risk: making emotional incompleteness virtuous, not tragic. Vision coheres across concept, setting, and character without gimmickry.</comment>
