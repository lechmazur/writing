<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation—rooted in intergenerational legacy and her “elusively tangible” gift—is embodied through micro-choices (accepting the knife, scraping paint) that reveal a hierarchy of values. Her internal contradiction (translator vs. protector) acts simultaneously, not as summary. The final renunciation—carrying permission to unfasten history—feels earned by prior causality with visible cost: the burden of truth-telling. Valdric’s indigo-stained hands deepen their relationship without overshadowing Mira’s interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lighthouse fragment reweights colonial erasure into recoverable truth via art-as-archive. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through pigment layers until fog becomes a projection screen. Cost is legible in the final image (“stories would dance in droplets… visible to all who knew how to look”), implying labor, risk, and selective visibility. Orientation anchors firmly by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The alchemist’s market functions as micro-setting: rope bridges constrain movement, stalls supply Valdric’s palette knife, and spatial choreography (descending ladders) mirrors thematic descent into buried history. The lighthouse painting itself becomes environment-as-tool—its pentimento layers physically constrain Mira’s choices. Final image charges the recurring object (fragment) by tying it to fog-bound projection, fulfilling the 9+ gate. Sensory detail (bubbling vials, indigo stains) filters through Mira’s professional attention.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering erased histories—is signaled early and tightens when Mira chooses to scrape paint, foreclosing passive observation. Agency drives escalation: her gift compels action, narrowing options from spectator to steward. Cost is unmistakable: she inherits the keeper’s daughter’s burden, trading safety for truth. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens through layered revelations (coordinates, spells, testimonies), each raising emotional and tactical stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: translation as resistance to erasure. The final image—stories dancing in harbor fog—offers a non-literal answer to “How do we honor overlooked histories?” by making the invisible visible only through ephemeral, communal witnessing. No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete particulars (lapis-stained hands, painted stars). Complexity endures: the fragment’s power is temporary (“briefly”), honoring the grandmother’s warning that some truths belong “to the spaces between.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Mira notices “silences that carried meaning,” “pentimento shadows,” and “indigo stains” through a translator’s bias. Rhythmic control under pressure shines in the scraping sequence—short sentences accelerate (“Each removed flake revealed more”) then breathe into lyrical cadence (“The eternal instant expanded”). No head-hopping; Valdric’s dialogue carries artisanal lexicon (“Unfasten what time has bound”) without convergence. Elision (childhood flashback) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density: “pentimento shadows beneath the paint, earlier versions bleeding through” conveys visual, historical, and emotional layers in one phrase. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“Now she stood…”, “You see it…”, “Mira nodded…”). Minor figurative density in the climax (“stories would dance in droplets”) avoids muddle by anchoring to the established refraction motif. Final line’s propulsion (“one translated truth at a time”) crystallizes theme without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ingenuity lies in synthesizing translation, light physics, and colonial erasure into a cohesive system where art preserves what language cannot. The “painted stars” celestial map feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious. Risk-taking (accumulative structure, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry—fog projection literalizes “spaces between” as both medium and metaphor. No derivative tropes; every element (lapis grinding, hand-signs) serves character and conflict with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
