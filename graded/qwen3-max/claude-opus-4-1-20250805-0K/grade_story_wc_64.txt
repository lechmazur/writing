<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Marta’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her grief, precision, and devotion emerge through tactile actions (pruning needle, magnifying lamp) rather than exposition. Her micro-choices (rewinding but not restarting the chess clock, choosing to plant the fragment tomorrow) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The contradiction between her need for ritual control and surrender to uncharted echoes feels authentic, never tidy. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise from sensory engagement with memory and matter.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Marta reweights death not as absence but as tending, with the tapestry fragment crystallizing this truth. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density builds via layered grief stories in threads, culminating in the realization that “the shape of intentions” is circular care. Cost is legible in the still chess clock and the deferred planting; time itself bends to accommodate revelation. Orientation is immediate (“cemetery gardener,” “cobalt silo”) and functional disorientation (shifting engravings) pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The cobalt silo isn’t backdrop—it’s a charged micro-setting that constrains choice (tool shed, workbench for decoding) and amplifies the final image (“stood sentinel behind her, holding its own echoes”). Sensory detail is selective and profession-filtered: starlight on shears, frayed grey threads, wind like applause. The “velveteen gloom” isn’t mood wallpaper—it’s the atmospheric condition under which death softens, enabling Marta’s epiphany. Every object (chess clock, sovereign case) is handled with tactile specificity that serves theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decoding grief’s transformation into devotion—is signaled early and deepens when Marta abandons her time ritual to fully engage the tapestry. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses patient untangling over force, mirroring her gardening ethos; this agency reweights all prior graves as “planted intentions.” Cost is felt in the still chess clock (suspended self-protection) and the weight of inherited responsibility. Pressure accumulates texturally, not causally, but remains coherent under the inferred lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through particulars: rosemary messages, chiseled laughter, grey-thread script—never stated but woven into action. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: life/death borders are garden paths maintained by love, reweighting every grave as active devotion. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers (Who made the tapestry? Why Marta?) without confusion. Final image of humming in velveteen gloom crystallizes the central question—how to hold loss tenderly—without platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: Marta notices what a gardener would (paint like pre-dawn sky, root-system patience), with diction rooted in horticulture and textile craft. Rhythm modulates—longer sentences for contemplation, shorter for discovery (“Letters emerged”). No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained (she doesn’t know the tapestry’s origin, only decodes its feeling). Prose-as-character: syntax mirrors her meticulousness, yet opens lyrically at climax (“stars wheeled overhead...”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. High information density: “starlight that pooled in the cobalt silo’s shadow” establishes setting, mood, and visual texture in one phrase. Figurative language is coherent (grief as gardens, tapestry as map) and peaks cleanly—no purple prose in high-pressure beats. Read-aloud rhythm varies purposefully, with paragraph cuts that heighten revelation (e.g., post-clock-click pause before studying the fragment).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms cemetery tropes through hyper-specificity: grief encoded in dyed-grey threads, time measured by chess clocks, sovereignty cases holding tapestries. The synthesis of gardening, textile preservation, and celestial timekeeping feels inevitable yet fresh. Bold risk in making the climax an act of quiet decoding—not confrontation—and it heightens thematic stakes. No derivative echoes; voice and concept cohere as singular artistic stance.</comment>
