<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied contradiction—her reverence for archival truth wars with her compassion for Eleanor, culminating in the micro-choice to embed hidden testimony. Her walnut-stained fingers and locket-handling reveal hierarchy of values without exposition. The final act of preserving both mercy and reckoning feels inevitable yet costly. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in sensory detail (“haunted euphoria,” “papery hands trembling”).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the covenant’s regeneration now carries dual meaning—personal grace and historical indictment. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, with pressure intensifying through layered revelations (fire’s cause, Thomas’s crime) that reweight Mara’s copying. Cost is legible in the microscopic codicil—a quiet but irreversible act. Every beat tightens around the central tension between erasure and preservation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The blooming jetty isn’t backdrop but active micro-setting: wisteria’s perfume anchors memory, twilight colors mirror moral ambiguity, and spatial choreography (Eleanor approaching through the bower) crystallizes the ending. The locket and ink set function as tool-as-setting, constraining Mara’s choice to write truth covertly. Sensory hierarchy reflects archivist’s POV—smell of tea, texture of paper, visual precision of script.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving truth vs. granting peace—is signaled early and deepens when Mara learns Thomas caused the fire. Her agency drives escalation: she doesn’t just copy but adds the codicil, foreclosing anonymity at personal risk. Cost is felt in “haunted euphoria” and the burden of the locket. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with each revelation narrowing ethical options until only layered truth remains.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the covenant’s dual restoration: some truths must be held alongside mercy, not instead of it. The final image—two women standing in wisteria’s sweetness—answers the central question non-literally: regeneration requires remembering everything. No moralizing; subtext lives in the codicil’s invisibility and Eleanor’s whispered thanks. Complexity abides—Thomas’s sin isn’t excused, but love persists beyond it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is flawlessly controlled single-third, with perceptual signature rooted in archival precision (“walnut-ink script that would outlast empires”). Syntax modulates under pressure—longer, lyrical sentences in reflection; tighter phrasing during decision-making. Voice remains consistent even in elevated moments (“haunted euphoria” fits Mara’s poetic professionalism). No head-hopping; Eleanor’s presence is filtered strictly through Mara’s observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence multitasks (e.g., “wisteria cascaded... petals catching the last amber light” establishes setting, time, and mood). Figurative language is precise and pattern-taught—“steep” recurs as both tea-brewing and emotional absorption. Zero loops or scaffold; closing lines echo opening imagery without redundancy. Minor deduction only for slight overuse of semicolons in mid-text, but no closure dulling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms archival trope through specific moral calculus: truth isn’t binary but layered, preserved in margins. The “regenerated covenant” concept feels fresh because its mechanics matter—watermark recreation, microscopic script. Risk-taking (embedding hidden history) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision coheres fully: voice, setting, and theme fuse into an inevitable, singular artifact.</comment>
