<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera’s interiority is vividly embodied—her psychometric gift manifests through tactile, sensory immersion rather than diagnostic labels. Her micro-choice to steal the film strip crystallizes her moral stance with visible cost: professional betrayal for emotional fidelity. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. reverence) act simultaneously in scene, especially when she sways under “forgotten lyrics.” The final renunciation—carrying secrets like seeds—is earned by prior accumulation of emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: unused love gains value through witnessing. Cost is legible in Vera’s clinical report versus her private ritual—a sacrifice of professional integrity for sacred preservation. Orientation is immediate (“projection booth of the Orpheum Palace”), and the spatial-emotional map tightens pressure without causal breaks. The final image reweights the entire premise: demolition cannot erase what has been seen.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The projection booth functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges every choice—its Art Deco curves, brass projector, and velvet seats below are not backdrop but active vessels of memory. Sensory detail is selective and profession-filtered (celluloid brittleness, splice marks, leader tape). The recurring film strip evolves from object to relic, culminating in Vera tasting “silver and salt.” This setting directly enables the closure: without its layered emotional geography, the goodbye letters would have no resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether unseen love deserves witness—is signaled early and deepens through Vera’s escalating immersion. Her agency drives the intensification: touching the projector, reading the film, recognizing Eleanor’s name, then choosing theft. The tightening forecloses her professional path (she must falsify her report) while affirming her spiritual duty. Cost is unmistakable: she trades institutional truth for poetic justice, and the wrecking ball looms as irreversible consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the collision of cinema and silence: the most profound stories are those never told. Subtext thrives in the gap between screen fantasy and booth confession. The ending offers a non-literal answer—Vera’s private screening grants dignity without resolution—and reweights every prior image (ticket stubs, splice marks, fogged glass) as sacred artifacts. No moralizing; resonance accrues through specificity, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is exquisitely controlled: lyrical but precise, with a perceptual signature rooted in Vera’s synesthetic gift (“words absorbed into emulsion,” “love traveled up through the projection beam”). Syntax modulates with pressure—long, flowing sentences during immersion; shorter, weighted phrases at climax (“Some things were too sacred for demolition”). No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. The prose itself performs the theme: making the invisible visible through disciplined metaphor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose—nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme without scaffold or loop. Figurative language is consistent (love as undeveloped photograph, booth as diary) and never muddled. Minor deduction for slight over-density in the middle (“spatially imaginative part of her gift…”), but rhythm breathes effectively toward the hushed final cadence. Zero paraphrase loops; high information density sustained throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of psychometry, cinema, and unsent letters feels inevitable yet fresh—a non-obvious angle on archival grief. Tropes (last keeper of memory, haunted theater) are transformed through concrete occupational detail (reel changes, leader tape, splice marks). The risk of lyric abstraction pays off because every image ties to Vera’s embodied choices. Originality lies not in premise but in execution: love stored in celluloid chemistry becomes emotionally and conceptually credible.</comment>
