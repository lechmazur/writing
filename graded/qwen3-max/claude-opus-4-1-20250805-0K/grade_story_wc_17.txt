<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her perception isn’t just a trait but a lived burden that shapes every micro-choice, from brushing aside ivy to photographing diaries before touching them. Her motivation intensifies credibly as she uncovers Voss’s work, transforming preservation from duty to communion. The final act of adding her whisper to the wall feels earned, not epiphanic, with cost legible in her solitude and legacy weight. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile detail and sensory precision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered echoes until the final Charged Poise: Mira’s notebook entry crystallizes purpose without resolving pressure, only deepening it for future cartographers. Orientation is immediate (“ivy-veiled passage,” “Mira Chen”), and closure delivers Conceptual Repricing—walls don’t just remember; they dream because humans taught them how—with undeniable emotional cost in Mira’s isolation. Every beat tightens the thematic coil; no causality breaks or amnesia.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled university isn’t backdrop but active architecture: it narrows passages, obscures archives, and dictates Mira’s movements, while the film strip and half-burned diaries function as micro-settings that constrain and enable her work. Sensory hierarchy reflects her profession—she hears molecular vibrations, feels stone thrumming—and the fireplace’s incomplete burn directly fuels the plot. Final image (notebook beside diary glimpsed through vegetation) charges the setting with legacy, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving acoustic memory—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes Voss shared her gift, raising the emotional price of failure. The tightening occurs at the doorway where urgent echoes compel her forward, narrowing options to extraction or abandonment. Cost is felt in her solitude and the fragility of diaries, though escalation leans more on discovery than active opposition; still, agency drives every turn under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as reciprocal act between human and place, not passive archive. Voss’s line “The walls remember everything” reframes into Mira’s “We taught them how to remember,” reweighting legacy from burden to covenant. No moralizing—resonance lives in the notebook left for unknown successors, inviting reflection without closure. Subtext thrives in what’s unsaid: extinction of echo cartographers makes each act both futile and sacred.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled first-person limited, with perceptual signature evident in how Mira filters the world through vibration and sound. Voice modulates subtly—from clinical focus during extraction to lyrical tenderness in the final entry—without register drift. Syntax varies purposefully (short staccato beats amid lush description), and elision (e.g., skipping evacuation logistics) serves texture, not confusion. No head-hopping; focalization remains impeccably consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ivy rustling with evening wind” does atmospheric and temporal work; “pages brown and brittle as autumn leaves” avoids cliché through specificity. Minor overwriting in “molecular structure of the walls” slightly strains plausibility but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold—every sentence advances character, setting, or theme. Final line’s rhythm (“patient as stone, faithful as ivy”) perfectly cadences the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The echo cartographer conceit transforms climate fiction tropes by grounding apocalypse in sensory archaeology rather than spectacle. Legacy isn’t inherited objects but perceptual inheritance—a fresh inflection that feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk: making silence and decay narratively active via acoustic memory. Vision coheres fully; no safety hedging in embracing quiet endurance as heroic act.</comment>
