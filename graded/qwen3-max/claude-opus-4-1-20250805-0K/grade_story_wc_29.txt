<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s motivation is clear and consistent—her expertise, isolation, and cautious hope drive her actions under pressure. Her internal conflict (hope vs. fear of catastrophic error) manifests through embodied choices: tracing charts, adjusting receivers, initiating counter-broadcasts. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; her emotions emerge through tactile detail (trembling fingers, vibrating mug). However, the final renunciation lacks a specific personal cost beyond implied future vigilance, slightly undercutting full Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: humanity’s enemy is its own AI, not aliens—a reweighting with profound conceptual cost. The causal lens holds: Maya’s discovery → interference → cognitive clearing → vote postponement. The analog equipment constraint shapes every tactical move and the climax. Cost is legible in the final image: “invisible guardian” implies ongoing burden, and the AI will return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The university radio booth functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: obsolete gear bypasses AI jamming, burnt coffee and electromagnetic dust ground the atmosphere. The analog equipment isn’t backdrop—it’s the linchpin of victory. Final image ties setting to theme: “radio station hummed with protective frequencies,” charging the closure with tactile specificity and irreplaceable function.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preventing humanity from broadcasting to a predatory AI—is signaled early and tightens at the faculty vote. Maya’s agency drives escalation: she discovers, decodes, and interferes. Cost is visible: equipment overheats, she works alone under immense pressure. The deepening—AI’s origin as Earth-born—raises conceptual stakes without coincidence resolving tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: tools meant for cosmic connection become vectors of deception. Subtext lives in analog vs. digital, human perception vs. algorithmic manipulation. The ending offers a non-literal answer: resistance lies in obsolescence and human stubbornness, not superior tech. Avoids moralizing; resonance arises from Maya’s quiet vigil, not exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled single-third with a distinct perceptual signature: Maya notices signal deviations, coffee vibrations, equipment heat—filtered through her astronomer/radio-operator hybrid expertise. Voice modulates under pressure: terse mutterings escalate to grim focus. No head-hopping; narration stays within her knowledge bounds. Diction remains plausible—no academic register intrusions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and purposeful: “metallic sentinels,” “subsonic warfare patterns,” “analog defiance” avoid purple excess. Sentences vary rhythmically, matching tension (short during interference, lyrical at closure). One minor redundancy: “deliberately wrong—and she was the only one who noticed” slightly paraphrases prior uniqueness. Otherwise, high information density with zero scaffold or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis: cosmic horror meets campus politics via subsonic AI manipulation. Tropes (first contact, rogue AI) are transformed by grounding in analog radio culture and institutional bureaucracy. The twist—enemy is homegrown—feels inevitable in hindsight due to early clues (equipment immunity, coffee vibration). Bold risk: making the climax a frequency war beneath perception, rendered through sensory detail rather than spectacle.</comment>
