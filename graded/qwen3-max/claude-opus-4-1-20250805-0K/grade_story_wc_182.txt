<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation—rooted in linguistic expertise and ethical curiosity—is consistent and intensifies under pressure. Her micro-choices (marking paths, speaking phantom titles, offering the diary) reveal a hierarchy of values: knowledge as shared seed, not hoarded artifact. Interiority is concrete (“diary grew warm,” “pressed specimens glowing”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The final renunciation—offering completion over extraction—feels earned, with the cost visible in the amber-seekers’ near-permanent stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: unlearned lessons shift from preserved relics to planted seeds, reweighting the library’s purpose. The mountain’s sentient logic holds causally—Mira’s offer directly triggers release. Cost is legible in the frozen seekers’ near-loss and the diary’s transformation. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 30; lens is Accumulative/Textural, validated by the symphony’s crescendo and spatial tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures choices (rearranging corridors, testing logic in the circular room). Granite shelves, humming volumes, and amber preservation constrain tactics and charge the climax. The botanical diary’s glow responds to acoustics, making environment and object co-conspirators. Final image of “garden of knowledge” reconfigures setting meaning with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—accessing wisdom without becoming trapped—tightens decisively in the amber chamber where Mira must renegotiate, not extract. Her agency drives escalation: researching gaps → navigating traps → offering completion. Cost is unmistakable: predecessors’ fossilization, the diary’s blank pages as sacrificial space. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her linguistic skill and ethical stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: pressed flowers as knowledge, silver silk as fragile memory, amber as failed rescue. The ending reweights “unlearned lessons” from static archive to living propagation—resonant, non-literal, avoiding moralizing. Complexity persists: wisdom requires both preservation and dissemination, with failure baked into the mountain’s logic. No tidy binaries; the time traveler’s warning contextualizes but doesn’t dictate Mira’s solution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Mira’s arcane linguist perception (“linguistic patterns between roots,” “dead languages”). Voice modulates with pressure: lyrical in discovery (“unheard symphony”), terse in crisis (“room shuddered”). Syntax varies purposefully—longer sentences for wonder, fragments for urgency. No head-hopping; the time traveler’s presence remains external until rescued.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “corridors spiraling through hollowed rock like chambers of an ancient heart” does setting, metaphor, and tone in one. Figurative language is coherent (botanical motifs sustain throughout). Minor density in high-pressure beats (“phantom books from memory… speaking titles”) risks slight overwriting but pays off in the stairway reveal. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise transforms tropes: library-as-labyrinth becomes sentient arbiter; time travel serves thematic stakes, not mechanics. The “unlearned lessons” concept feels fresh through botanical framing and linguistic embodiment. Risk-taking (sentient mountain, symphonic books) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision coheres—every element (diary, silk, amber) serves the core question: can wisdom be rescued or only renewed?</comment>
