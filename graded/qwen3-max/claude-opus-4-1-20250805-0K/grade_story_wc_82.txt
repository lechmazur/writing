<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mei’s interiority is concrete and character-particular, rooted in her craft and grief; her micro-choices—polishing dream-gems, weaving them into lanterns—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Her transformation from capturing light to preserving love feels earned through consistent action, not epiphany. The only slight flaw: Lin’s “possibility” vision risks veering into diagnostic abstraction but is grounded by Mei’s embodied response (“strange peace”). No safety-hedging; her flawed endurance forecloses rebuilding Lin yet creates something sustaining.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mei accepts she cannot rebuild what’s lost but transforms grief into guiding light, with clear conceptual cost (“only transform it into something that helps the living”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via recurring dream-gems, culminating in the thousandth crane. Orientation is immediate (“lantern maker’s fingers trembled... beneath the glass basilica”), and the pattern of memory-polishing tightens meaningfully toward the end. Cost is legible in the final image: lanterns cast dancing shadows that are both loss and legacy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The floating tea garden, glass basilica, and dream-gems aren’t backdrop—they constrain choice and charge closure. Mei’s tools (gems, polishing cloth) function as micro-setting, shaping every action. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., “clouds that concealed the world below” mirrors her obscured hope). The basilica’s transparent walls reappear at the end, now filled with her lanterns—a charged reprise where environment embodies thematic shift. Every object serves pressure or closure without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming grief into bearable form—is signaled early and deepens when Mei discovers “possibility” in a gem, shifting from preservation to acceptance. This protagonist-driven intensification narrows her path: she stops merely recording and begins crafting lanterns, foreclosing private mourning for communal healing. Cost is felt (“luminous torment”) and visible in others’ tears. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices, though a second tightening (e.g., Master Shen’s dialogue prompting a concrete choice) would push this higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Mei’s craft: love persists beyond loss not by denial but transformation. The final image—lanterns casting “shadows that danced like living things”—offers a non-literal answer to grief’s burden, reweighting earlier motifs (cranes, light, shadow) without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture (polishing as folding grief) and silence (other parents weeping). Avoids sentimentality by embracing complexity: joy and sorrow coexist in the same light. No overt thesis; wisdom arises from specific acts, not platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: syntax mirrors Mei’s meticulous craft (long, fluid sentences for reflection; shorter phrases under emotional pressure). Perceptual signature is strong—she notices light, texture, and hands first. No head-hopping; single POV remains stable. Diction stays within her lexicon (“crafty,” “bending glass”), avoiding academic drift. Patterned elision (compressed time between shards) is taught early (“three months later”) and pays off in closure. Prose modulates rhythm purposefully, especially in the climactic gem-polishing beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “grinding away layers of raw anguish while simultaneously lifting the essence of love”). Figurative language is coherent—light/shadow/descent motifs never contradict. Minor overwriting in one peak beat (“luminous torment—beautiful to behold yet agonizing to create”) edges toward label-speak but is immediately grounded in action. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary naturally. Final line crystallizes theme without redundancy, recharging “ascending descent” with earned resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesizing grief-work with artisanal craft: dream-recording isn’t magic but labor, like lantern-making. The “floating isle” trope is transformed through tactile specificity (bridges of woven moonlight, cloud-concealed world). Emotional truth anchors novelty—Mei’s realization that “attachment to one form of love” must detach feels fresh yet inevitable. Bold risk: making the climax an internal shift (seeing Lin’s potential future) rather than external action, which heightens stakes without gimmickry. Premise avoids template through irreplaceable details (gem polishing mechanics, tea garden choreography).</comment>
