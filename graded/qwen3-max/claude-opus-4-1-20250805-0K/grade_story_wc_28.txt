<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sarai’s interiority is concrete, contradictory, and embodied—her “aberrant mercy” clashes with guilt, yet compels her to act. Micro-choices (kneeling, fitting the tessera, choosing to gather others) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The old man’s presence sharpens her stance without diluting her POV. Her final resolve feels earned, not declared.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the mosaic reconfigures to include “Sarai, the Gentle Radical,” transforming her curse into an invitation. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through visions, pattern realignment, and cadence shifts that reweight mercy as generative, not penitent. Cost is legible in her weeping, scars, and the Brotherhood’s threat. Orientation is immediate and functional disorientation pays off in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The tessera, stepping stones, and shattered sky are micro-settings that constrain and charge every turn. The plaza’s spiral path and blackened stones shape Sarai’s actions; the fractured sky mirrors thematic rupture yet ends as promise. Sensory detail is selective (crimson gleam, warm stone, frost) and filtered through trauma and purpose. The setting evolves causally—from ruin to potential garden—and directly enables the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether mercy can rebuild after destruction—is signaled early and deepens through each vision. Escalation is driven by Sarai’s agency: she chooses to restore, triggering memories that clarify her role not as restorer but creator. Cost is unmistakable: exile, grief, bodily fatigue, and the Brotherhood’s condemnation. The tightening culminates in her renunciation of restoration for co-creation—a trade-off with social and existential stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tessera’s dual role as fragment and seed. “Aberrant mercy” is tested not through debate but through action—hiding families, renaming, returning nightly. The final image of refugees building homes from old stones offers a non-literal answer: compassion isn’t purity but transformation. No moralizing; resonance arises from the mosaic’s realignment and the sky’s starlit fractures.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled first-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature—Sarai notices patterns, warmth, absence. Voice modulates under pressure: shorter sentences during visions, lyrical flow in reflection. Diction (“warm coldness,” “arms of steel”) reflects her steel-gentle duality. No head-hopping; the old man’s dialogue carries subtext without exposition. Compression is purposeful and pattern-taught by the second paragraph.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and image-driven. Opening line (“The tessera gleamed crimson…”) anchors voice and stakes; final line (“like a promise”) recharges the sky motif. Minor overwriting in “strange, cold warmth” slightly muddles sensation, but figurative language remains coherent. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis: retrocognition as divine invitation, not punishment; mosaic as living scripture; mercy as radical reconstruction. Tropes (cursed protagonist, fallen minaret) are grounded in specific cultural texture (ninety-nine names, clay tablets). The “gentle radical” reframes resistance through care, not violence. Risk-taking (non-causal structure, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
