<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya’s dual allegiance and internal contradiction are embodied through tactile actions—pressing the stone chip, translating graffiti—and culminate in a credible renunciation of direct negotiation for cultural resistance. Her orderly intuition drives tactical choices (forging documents, legal repositioning) with visible cost: sacrificing personal ease for communal survival. The final image of her at the edge, holding knowledge of both worlds, crystallizes her enduring tension without tidy resolution. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion remains physical and conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the community becomes “something they can’t buy,” foreclosing assimilation with the cost of perpetual vigilance. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—graffiti patterns deepen into legal murals, carnival chaos hardens into protected heritage. Cost is legible in the stone chip’s relocation and Maya’s liminal stance. Orientation anchors instantly (“raft city of Nueva Corriente”), and escalation tightens via developer arrival triggering reorganization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The raft city isn’t backdrop but active constraint: platforms dictate movement, wave generators power lights, recycled bottles enable buoyancy—all shaping tactics. The foundation stone chip functions as micro-setting, its rough edge cutting Maya’s thumb during pivotal decisions. Final image charges setting: mainland boats approach a carnival now armored by law, its lights “protected by the very laws that had threatened to extinguish them.” Sensory detail (oil-drum fires, neon signs) filters through Maya’s urgent POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving autonomy against privatization—is signaled early via graffiti and deepens when developers arrive. Maya’s agency drives escalation: she chooses cultural reorganization over negotiation, narrowing options to legal subterfuge. Cost is unmistakable: surrendering direct confrontation for bureaucratic endurance, with the stone chip’s permanence marking what’s preserved at the price of constant adaptation. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—graffiti density intensifies into protective art.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: preservation as resistance, culture as armor. The ending offers non-literal resolution—the community survives not by fighting but by becoming legally unintelligible to developers—repricing “heritage” as tactical shield. No moralizing; resonance arises from the stone chip’s journey and murals encoding law as art. Complexity endures: Maya’s mainland education is both weapon and wound, avoiding binary redemption.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled single-third, with perceptual signature evident in how Maya reads graffiti as language and stone as memory. Voice modulates rhythmically—shorter sentences during developer arrival, lyrical cadence in carnival descriptions—without register drift. Prose reflects her orderly intuition: observations parse chaos into actionable codes (“TIDE RISES AT NOON”). No head-hopping; even crowd scenes filter through her interpretive lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose maintains high information density: “perpetual carnival lights reflecting off black water like scattered prayers” establishes tone, setting, and theme in one image. Figurative language is coherent (graffiti as warning system, stone as anchor) without muddle. Minor redundancy in “reorganize to resist them entirely” / “reorganize tonight” slightly dulls propulsion, but closure beat (“STILL FLOATING, STILL FREE”) lands with crystalline clarity. No scaffold loops or purple prose in peak moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise transforms gentrification tropes via specific synthesis: floating carnival as ungovernable cultural archive, graffiti as legal code, scholarship education as double-edged shield. The raft city’s mechanics (recycled bottles, wave generators) ground surrealism in plausible ecology. Risk-taking—making bureaucracy poetic via mural-law—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet fresh, rooted in the stone chip’s journey from relic to cornerstone.</comment>
