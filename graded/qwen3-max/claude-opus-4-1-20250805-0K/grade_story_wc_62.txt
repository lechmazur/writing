<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Martha’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her grief is both personal and communal, her craft both solitary and connective. Her micro-choices (retracing names, reading poems aloud) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: endurance over resolution, witness over closure. The spectral grandfather functions not as exposition but as an extension of her own disciplined conscience. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied in chisel pressure, ribbon handling, and monarch-watching.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (monarchs, ribbon, poems) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: collective grief as migration. Closure lands with undeniable cost—the grandfather’s voice fades, the butterflies depart, Martha remains alone—but the memorial transforms absence into shared presence. The pattern is taught early (monarchs at opening, ribbon unrolled), and every beat tightens around the central stake: how to carve communal sorrow without flattening individual loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse is not backdrop but crucible: its glass holds words like cupped hands, its dying light frames the monarchs’ departure, and its spatial intimacy concentrates the emotional weight of seventeen families touching one stone. The milkweed, chisel, and woven ribbon are micro-settings that constrain and charge choices—Martha carves by touch when clouds darken, guided by memory and material. Every sensory detail serves the Accumulative lens, narrowing to tactile immediacy under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—giving shape to collective grief—is signaled by the first paragraph and deepens through Martha’s struggle to braid individual losses into one design. The tightening occurs when the grandfather warns, “The migration won’t wait,” forcing urgency that narrows options: she must finish before the butterflies leave, before his presence fades. Cost is unmistakable: her solitude, his departure, the irreversible act of finalizing names in stone. Agency drives escalation—her retracing, her poem readings, her listening—not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: monarch migration, granite carving, woven ribbon, family poems. The final image reweights all prior material—the butterflies carry words south, grief becomes journey, stone becomes vessel—without stating a moral. Subtext thrives in silence (empty kitchen), gesture (fingers finding names), and inherited craft. The story resists sentimentality by grounding transcendence in labor: grief is shaped by hand, not declared by voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is fiercely meditative yet lyrical, with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure—longer sentences for reflection, shorter for urgency (“Worked faster”). The perceptual signature is consistent: Martha notices grain in wood and grief, light on indigo thread, the thundering calm in voices. Free indirect style merges her thought with narration seamlessly (“Grief has grain, like wood”), and dialogue (though sparse) carries subtext and ancestral authority. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored in Martha’s sensory and emotional field.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line: “iron bones black against the salmon sky” establishes setting, tone, and metaphor in one stroke. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and figurative language is coherent (butterflies as grief-migrants, ribbon as connection). No loops or scaffold; every image pays off. Minor deduction only because one or two descriptors edge toward elevated diction (“thundering calm”) without full grounding in Martha’s lexicon—but this is earned by familial idiom.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravestone carving, monarch migration, spectral mentorship, and woven-poem tradition feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (ghostly guide, artisan protagonist) are transformed by specificity: the ribbon’s indigo threads, the practice cuts for each family, the dinner-table poetry ritual. The risk—lyric accumulative structure over causal plot—heightens thematic resonance without sacrificing clarity. Originality lies not in novelty but in the precise calibration of image, labor, and loss.</comment>
