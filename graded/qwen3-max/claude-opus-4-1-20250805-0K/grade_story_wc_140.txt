<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mari’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied perception—her grief as “fabric unraveling,” her navigation by echo—not therapy-speak. Her contradictory state (legally dead yet breathing) fuels micro-choices: signing three names, writing in pencil “light enough to be mistaken for shadows.” The poison label functions as both emotional compass and tangible proof of systemic failure, grounding her moral ambiguity in concrete detail. Her final act of inscription earns Charged Poise with visible cost: permanent alignment with the erased.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is established by paragraph two (“collector of lost stories”) and held rigorously through layered annotations, tidal rhythms, and rust-as-memory motifs. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the wet-ink line “We who don't exist must testify to each other's presence” reweights all prior solitude into communal witness, with cost legible in Mari’s triple signature—erasure made ritual. The container labyrinth’s daily shifts provide organic escalation; no causality breaks. Orientation is immediate and functional disorientation (namelessness) pays off thematically at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The shipping container maze isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint: walls shift overnight, forcing sonic navigation; high tides isolate Mari for reading; metal groans harmonize with testimonies. The poison label (micro-setting) charges the final image as “compass pointing toward memories that refused to die correctly.” Sensory hierarchy reflects Mari’s filter: she notices echo patterns, rust textures, ink wetness—not visual spectacle. Every detail serves pressure or closure; no white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bearing witness to erased lives—is signaled early and deepens when Mari recognizes annotators as fellow “administrative ghosts.” Her agency drives escalation: choosing high tides for access, adding her own layer, finally signing. Cost is unmistakable: she foregoes legal identity permanently, embracing “something in between.” The spring tide discovery (“fresh ink, still wet”) narrows options from solitary observer to congregant, crystallizing stance under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through particulars: mislabeled poison, wrong-name death certificates, unread suicide notes—all compressed truths that outlive official records. The final image reweights everything: rust (erasure) becomes permanent testimony, containers (bureaucratic cages) become chapels. No moralizing; resonance accrues via the triple signature and wet ink—proof that presence persists beyond documentation. Complexity thrives: erasure is both wound and liberation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is flawlessly controlled—Mari’s perceptual signature (memory as tactile weave, sound as spatial map) permeates syntax. Prose rhythm modulates with tide: short clauses during dock-worker eavesdropping, lyrical cadence in drowned quiet. No head-hopping; even overheard dialogue (“Did you hear about the woman…”) filters through Mari’s ghostly attention. Voice remains consistent under stress—no register drift into abstraction during peak realization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “rust-streaked surfaces catching dawn light,” “stories bleeding into the next like watercolors.” Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is coherent (memory as fabric, truth as adhesive fragment) and peaks without muddle. Final line’s “compass pointing toward memories that refused to die correctly” earns its lyricism through prior concrete buildup—no purple prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms bureaucratic horror into poetic resistance: death certificates and pharmacy errors become portals to collective haunting. The container-as-archive is fresh, specific, and irreplaceable—no generic liminal space. Risk-taking (accumulative structure, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular: a theology of administrative ghosts where rust and wet ink are sacred texts.</comment>
