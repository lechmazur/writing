<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete and character-particular, especially in her systematic work under mortal pressure. Her contradiction—accepting death while urgently translating interspecies dialogue—is embodied in precise micro-choices (e.g., trembling hands making the final connection). The tumor-as-tool revelation avoids diagnostic label-speak by grounding it in electromagnetic function. Her motivation intensifies credibly from groundskeeper to bridge, with visible cost in time and body.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “Six months wasn’t a death sentence—it was an appointment.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through copper network expansion until the orchard’s phosphorescent reply reweights human perception itself. Cost is legible in Mira’s foreclosed future and the trustees’ imminent confrontation. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3, and the diary’s early introduction pays off structurally and thematically.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The temple orchard functions as a dynamic micro-setting: living stone pillars constrain choice (only the dying can perceive frequencies) and charge the final image (glowing minerals mirroring root networks). Sensory detail is selective—copper vibration, bark texture, phosphorescence—and filtered through Mira’s urgent, technical attention. The setting isn’t backdrop but active participant, evolving causally with each wire placement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving interspecies council against human erasure—tightens when Mira realizes remodeling must target perception, not architecture. Her agency drives escalation: extending the copper network deepens understanding and forces the final stand. Cost is unmistakable: six months of life traded for translation, crystallized in the trustees’ looming arrival. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from copper wires and stone hums, not assertion: interspecies respect requires sacrifice, not extraction. The final line reweights the premise—“die into translation”—without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers (will trustees listen?), but resonance is earned through Mira’s concrete labor. No pseudo-profundity; wisdom arises from electromagnetic pulses and pressed leaves.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: technical yet lyrical (“architectural frequencies only the dying could perceive”), with rhythmic control that breathes during night work and tightens at dawn realization. POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—Mira notices angles, tension, spiral directions first. Elision is purposeful (no backstory dump), and compression serves the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “The copper wire vibrated against the bark, and somewhere deep in the stone, something shifted” does triple duty. Minor overwriting in “brazen calm” risks abstraction but is grounded immediately by action. No loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (salt spray diagnosis, stone as memory). Final paragraph’s cadence modulates perfectly with thematic weight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise transforms ecological fantasy via hard-science mysticism: tumor as necessary translator, copper as linguistic medium. Every element synthesizes uniquely—botanical diary, volcanic pillars, resort threat—into an inevitable whole. Risk-taking (dying as professional qualification) heightens stakes without gimmickry. No template echoes; vision feels singular and fully committed.</comment>
