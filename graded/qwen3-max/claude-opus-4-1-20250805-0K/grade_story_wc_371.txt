<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lila’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her noticing is both gift and burden, embodied in her tending of secret gardens. Her final choice to continue planting seeds is earned through prior micro-choices (e.g., following the bread trail, cultivating thornrose hedges). The elderly woman’s presence sharpens Lila’s self-understanding without overriding her agency. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through sensory perception (“bread tasted of forgiveness and time”).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each anomaly builds density until the tea house manifests as a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands via Conceptual Repricing—absence as disguised presence—with clear cost (Lila must tend hidden gardens to sustain sacred spaces). Orientation is immediate (“Tuesday morning,” “palace wall”), and causality flows from attention-as-action. The final image crystallizes stakes without mechanical resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting functions as active constraint and charge: jasmine vines hide bread, thornrose conceals a door, guerrilla plantings enable the tea house’s existence. Sensory details (rosemary scent, upward shadows) are filtered through Lila’s perceptual bias. The palace courtyard evolves from abandoned ruin to sanctuary via her interventions. Final image ties environment directly to closure—gardens sustain liminal spaces.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—granting absolution through witnessing—is signaled early and deepens when Lila enters the tea house. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: her attentiveness literally materializes lost things. Cost is legible (“as long as someone tends the gardens”) and conceptual (eternal responsibility for displaced sacredness). Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from Lila’s choices to notice and nurture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the sacred persists through ordinary acts of attention. No moralizing—the insight arises via bread’s transformation into memory and seeds that “wouldn’t exist unless planted.” Final image reweights the premise: reality is negotiable for those who witness its experiments. Ambiguity lingers (ghost birds, flickering tea house) without confusion, resisting tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled single-third with Lila’s perceptual signature—she notices moths’ flight patterns, upward shadows, warmth in waxed paper. Voice modulates rhythmically: short clauses for discovery (“Behind the vegetation stood a door”), lyrical cadence for revelation. No head-hopping; even the woman’s dialogue reflects Lila’s interpretive frame. Diction stays grounded (“guerrilla plantings,” “heuristic kindness”) without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“tomatoes climbing the palace walls, squash hiding beneath forgotten statuary”). Figurative language is purposeful (bread “uncloaked itself slowly”); no mixed metaphors. Minor redundancy in “benevolent secrets”/“displaced sacred,” but no loops or scaffold. Final line (“tasted of forgiveness and time”) perfectly echoes opening sensory motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise transforms familiar tropes (haunted bakeries, magical realism) through specificity: waxed paper, moon radishes, thornrose hedges. Emotional truth grounds ingenuity—Lila’s “cursed awareness” reframed as ministry. Risk-taking (textural accumulation over causality) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Every element feels inevitable in hindsight; no derivative echoes.</comment>
