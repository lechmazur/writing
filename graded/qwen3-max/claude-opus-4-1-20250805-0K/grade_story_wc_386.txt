<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marina’s motivation—salvaging truth from wreckage—is embodied in micro-choices (handling the globe, transcribing the formula) and rooted in fifteen years of diving. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest through tactile perception (“warped plastic edges,” “borrowed starlight”). The chemist ghost functions as a pressure source, not a relationship crucible, fitting single-POV scope. Final renunciation of anonymity for purpose is earned with visible cost: she accepts lifelong duty as salvage artist.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the dead aren’t echoes but active agents encoding hope into objects, reweighting Marina’s entire career as preparation. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of ghostly cameos intensifies until the formula’s revelation crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible in the final image: “carrying borrowed starlight” implies perpetual burden. Orientation anchors immediately (“glacier shrine,” “Marina,” “Cassandra’s wreck”), and causality holds without retroactive patches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glacier shrine isn’t backdrop—it constrains choice by enabling vision only via candlelight angles and ice refraction. The melted snow globe functions as micro-setting: its warped plastic and fused cityscape directly enable decoding the formula. Sensory detail is selective (candle warmth on ice, wind-like voice) and filtered through Marina’s diver expertise. Final constellation map charges the closure, transforming setting into navigational imperative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering the antidote—is signaled early and deepens when Marina learns of twelve more globes, escalating her mission. Pressure tightens via protagonist agency: her transcription activates the chemist’s spirit and reveals global stakes. Cost is felt in Charged Poise: dawn approaches as spirits fade, forcing immediate action. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; ghosts’ appearances are deliberate, tied to Marina’s unique perception.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: wreckage contains purity, destruction preserves hope. The snow globe’s “dream architecture” reweights earlier dives as sacred acts, not treasure hunts. Final image (“windows of connection opened in unexpected places”) offers non-literal answer to central question—how to find meaning in loss—without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: will humanity deserve the salvaged truths?</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Marina notices ice refraction, glove friction, candle physics—diver’s pragmatism fused with mystic receptivity. Rhythm modulates from lyrical (shrine description) to urgent (transcription beat) without losing voice. No head-hopping; ghost dialogue remains sparse and wind-textured, avoiding convergence. Elision is taught early (“faces emerging like breath on glass”) and pays off in dream cameo mechanics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose maintains high information density: “warped plastic edges through her diving gloves” conveys object state, character history, and tactile immediacy. Figurative language is coherent (“borrowed starlight,” “wind through ice caves”) and never muddled. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“She placed,” “Marina had spent,” “The ghost...”). Closure beat (“carrying borrowed starlight”) avoids artifact while crystallizing theme.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise transforms ghost tropes via scientific stakes (antidote encoding) and ecological urgency. “Windows of connection” reframes haunting as collective unconscious activism. Risk-taking—lyric structure with causal payload—heightens coherence: dream cameos aren’t whimsy but data points. Irreplaceable synthesis: only a diver-ghost-whisperer could decode ice-refracted hope-architecture in a melted toy.</comment>
