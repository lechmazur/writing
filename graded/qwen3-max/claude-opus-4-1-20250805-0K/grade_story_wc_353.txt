<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation—restoring lost sound through empathy—drives every micro-choice with tangible cost (e.g., rejecting force in favor of tenderness). Her interiority is embodied (“porcelain insulator grew warm in her hand, conducting… musical memory through her bones”) and avoids diagnostic label-speak. The hedgehog’s presence externalizes her impact without dialogue, reinforcing her role as conduit rather than creator. Final renunciation of extraction for collaboration earns stasis with visible emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira’s symphony hangs “like morning mist,” reconfiguring silence from void to vessel, with cost etched into the insulator’s new fractures. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via layered bird-memories in bark cracks until cadence shifts at noon. Orientation anchors instantly (“hedgehog uncurled at dawn… workshop window”), and the single-scene shard fits Track A defaults flawlessly. Every beat tightens toward acoustic resurrection without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The siskin alder grove isn’t backdrop but active constraint: its stress-cracked bark dictates Mira’s method, while moss and telegraph-pole porcelain root tools in lived history. Sensory hierarchy prioritizes tactile resonance (“pressed it gently against the tree’s largest crack”) over visual cliché. Final image charges the insulator’s new fractures as future archives, fulfilling the 9+ gate where object-as-setting shapes closure. Weather/time evolve coherently from dawn chill to noon warmth without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming organic sound in a mechanized silence—tightens when Mira rejects predecessors’ hammering for strumming, narrowing options to empathetic extraction. Cost is unmistakable: the insulator fractures anew, sacrificing itself to hold today’s song. Escalation stems purely from Mira’s agency under Accumulative pressure; coincidence never resolves. The hedgehog’s midday curl clocks rising stakes, forcing completion before safety vanishes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: compassion as antidote to silence crystallizes when Mira’s dance with scars births birdsong ghosts. No moralizing—resonance lives in the insulator’s self-sacrificial etching and the hedgehog’s smile. Central question (“Can stolen beauty be restored?”) answers non-literally: yes, through patient listening that accepts irreversible loss (cracks remain). Ambiguity lingers—will humanity hear?—without confusing the earned victory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is immaculate: Mira notices stress patterns as “frozen sound waves,” filtering world through symphonic cognition. Rhythm modulates from dawn stillness (“spines relaxing into moss”) to strumming crescendo, then noon hush. Zero head-hopping; porcelain’s warmth conducts memory “through her bones” with voice-consistent synesthesia. Final line’s hedgehog smile avoids sentimentality by grounding wonder in observed behavior, not assertion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves high-density propulsion: “stress cracks from decades of silent screaming” merges setting, theme, and character in one phrase. Zero loops or scaffold—each sentence advances atmosphere (“yellow bodies darting between branches that swayed in a wind she couldn’t feel but could finally hear”). Figurative coherence holds: sound as “acoustic architecture,” memory as “geological strata.” Closure beat (“etched with tiny fractures of its own”) avoids purple prose while deepening irreplaceability.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Premise transforms ecological grief into tactile ritual: trees as phonographs, sculptors as archaeologists of vibration. Risk-taking heightens stakes—Mira’s method could fail (others tried hammering), making success feel earned. Porcelain insulator’s dual history (telegraph hum + tree-song) synthesizes technology/nature without gimmickry. Final image reweights silence from absence to archive, offering fresh angle on restoration ecology through irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
