<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sensory map maker’s motivation—uncovering a withheld truth tied to fragmented identity—is compelling and consistent, driving every leap between worlds. Interiority is vividly embodied through tactile perception of the shard and atmospheric immersion, avoiding diagnostic labels. However, internal conflict remains largely unarticulated as simultaneous contradictory impulses; instead, desire unfolds linearly without meaningful resistance or self-sabotage in-scene. The final determination feels earned but lacks the micro-choice under duress that would elevate it to 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the map maker stands ready at the mysterious door, power spent but resolve intensified—a crystallized moment where stakes, options, and cost are legible. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with patterned transitions taught early and reinforced via cyclic spontaneity. Orientation is immediate (who, where, when anchored by line 3), and the dream-state climax pays off the opening murmurs. Cost is felt in the shard’s dimming and receding revelations, though the “weight” of truth remains abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport repair bay functions effectively as micro-setting: dust motes, frozen tools, and shafts of light establish mood and history while grounding spatial choreography. The green glass shard acts as an extension of setting—its warmth, pulse, and heat directly constrain action (e.g., preventing contact with the red shard). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, prioritizing touch and vision appropriate to a sensory cartographer. However, the environment doesn’t actively pressure choices beyond atmosphere; it enables but doesn’t compel.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering the weight of a withheld truth—is signaled early and deepens through witnessed alternate timelines, each revealing facets of possible histories. The tightening occurs when the green shard blocks access to the red shard, foreclosing a path and intensifying mystery. Agency is maintained through active redirection of flows, and cost is visible in the shard’s exhaustion and fading dream. Yet escalation relies more on accumulation than causal narrowing of options, slightly limiting pressure under a strict Causal lens—but fits Accumulative design well.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the pursuit of truth across fractured realities reflects the fragility of memory and identity. Subtext thrives in the shard’s resistance, the elusive door, and the recurring whispers—never stated outright. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: revelation is deferred, but persistence itself becomes the response to absence. Avoids moralizing, yet the “withheld truth” remains so abstract that thematic specificity slightly dissipates in the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable, immersive third-person limited, filtered through the map maker’s perceptual signature—attuned to texture, resonance, and hidden currents. Voice modulates with intensity: lyrical in description (“dust motes danced”), taut during transitions (“reality began to fray”). Syntax varies purposefully, with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping, and diction stays within plausible lexicon—though occasional elevated phrasing (“thrums with forgotten histories”) borders on ornamental without grounding in character idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is lush but controlled, with strong sentence-level propulsion and varied openings. Information density is high—each line advances atmosphere, character, or concept. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“shimmering possibilities that existed just beyond normal perception”), leaning into abstraction. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one register drift (“forbidden texts behind the Archives' sealed doors”) edges toward generic fantasy diction. Closure beat remains clear despite slight figurative softening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fusion of cartography with multiversal navigation—the “sensory map maker” reframes exploration as intimate, embodied archaeology of possibility. The green shard as both key and guardian feels fresh, and the cyclically spontaneous jumps avoid clichéd portal mechanics. Risk-taking in structure (mosaic shards of timelines) heightens stakes without gimmickry. However, the core premise echoes familiar “chosen one seeks lost truth” templates, partially offset by specific occupational framing and restraint in resolution.</comment>
