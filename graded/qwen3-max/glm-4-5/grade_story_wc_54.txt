<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya’s motivation—“to puzzle out new equations for hope”—is compelling and consistent, driving her technical actions with emotional weight. Her interiority blends professional curiosity (“functionally creative mind”) with poetic reflection without slipping into diagnostic label-speak. The sextant discovery and power restoration feel earned through micro-choices (kneeling, rerouting circuits), though internal contradiction is underexplored. Final renunciation of passive despair in favor of active creation carries quiet cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the terminal becomes a tool for navigating hope, not just space, with the sextant’s inscriptions reweighting Maya’s project. The Causal lens holds—each action follows from prior knowledge and choice—and the cost (years of neglect overcome by solitary labor) is legible in flickering lights and corroded circuits. Orientation is immediate (“abandoned spaceport… after the carnival left”), and escalation tightens cleanly toward the switch-throw climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The abandoned terminal functions as micro-setting: dust, dormant transformers, and ticket counters constrain Maya’s actions and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective (brass gleam, echoing footsteps) and filtered through an engineer’s attention. However, the “carnival” reference lacks spatial or tactile integration—it’s atmospheric but doesn’t pressure choices. The sextant and console anchor specificity without over-description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resurrecting meaning from abandonment—is signaled early and deepens when Maya discovers the sextant’s inscriptions, narrowing her focus to sustainable energy applications. Pressure escalates causally: dust → discovery → repair → revelation. Cost is felt in hours of solitary labor and the weight of inherited journeys, though external opposition is absent (acceptable under Situational/Causal hybrid). Coincidence (finding the sextant) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency drives the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: infrastructure as vessel for human intention, hope as engineered flow. The sextant-terminal parallel avoids moralizing, instead offering a resonant CR—navigation applies to emotion as much as space. Final image (lights like stars, equations documented) reweights the opening emptiness without stating a thesis. Ambiguity lingers: will this spark broader change? But the personal stakes feel earned, not abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, with a perceptual signature blending engineering precision (“rerouting connections,” “corroded circuits”) and lyrical wonder (“stars awakening”). Syntax varies purposefully—longer sentences for reflection, clipped phrases during work. No dialogue, so voice rests entirely on narration, which modulates effectively under pressure. Minor register drift in “equations for hope” risks abstraction but is grounded by concrete action immediately after.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with strong verbs (“brushed away,” “threw the main switch”) and varied sentence openings. A few near-redundancies (“maze of intentions” repeated without deepening) and one overwrought metaphor (“sleeping giants” for transformers) slightly dull momentum. No scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks; closure beat remains clear. Information density is high—most lines advance plot, character, or atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of civil engineering pragmatism with mythic resonance (sextant in spaceport). Tropes—abandoned place, artifact discovery—are transformed by specificity: Maya’s professional lens, the “redirected flows” method, and hope as calculable equation. Risk-taking (lyric tech-poetry) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight, anchored in verifiable detail (transformers, circuits) rather than generic futurism.</comment>
