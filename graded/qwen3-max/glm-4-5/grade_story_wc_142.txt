<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s interior conflict—torn between elders and entrepreneurs—is embodied through tactile details (foundation chip, graffiti tracing) and micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values. Their “orderly intuitive” trait drives action rather than serving as label-speak. However, the resolution leans slightly toward unearned epiphany: the decoding leap feels swift for such high stakes. Still, the final renunciation (returning the chip) carries visible cost and aligns with prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with pattern density escalating through graffiti mapping, flash mobs, and community participation. Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing: the city’s survival hinges on revaluing encoded cultural knowledge, not corporate negotiation. Cost is legible in Maya’s sleepless nights, strategic secrecy, and the perpetual risk of exposure. The dawn notice’s favorable terms feel earned because the visual resistance visibly shifts investor perception.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Neptunia’s floating carnival setting isn’t backdrop—it actively enables the resistance (graffiti as public yet coded medium, rafts as negotiable zones). Sensory details (fried funnel cakes, saltwater, sequined costumes) are filtered through Maya’s urgency, never touristy. The foundation stone and graffiti murals function as micro-settings that constrain and charge choices. Final image—children playing over hidden coordinates—proves environment shapes legacy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cultural survival amid gentrification—is signaled early and tightens through corporate emissaries’ arrival and scheduled meetings. Maya’s agency drives escalation: decoding, organizing, teaching. Cost is felt in exhaustion, secrecy, and moral tension. The “favorable” outcome avoids deus ex machina because it stems directly from Maya’s embedded counterproposals, though the junior council member’s role borders on convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: culture persists not by resisting change but by encoding wisdom into adaptive forms. The spiral-in-circle symbol and returning stone reject individual heroism for collective memory. No moralizing—the final hopscotch scene implies resilience without stating it. However, “the water remembers what land forgets” flirts with thematic echo, slightly diluting subtextual purity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: Maya notices patterns others miss, translating chaos into order. Voice modulates with pressure—shorter sentences during mapping frenzy, lyrical flow in closure. Prose rhythm mirrors carnival cadence. Minor flaw: the phrase “culture shock absorber smiled” briefly breaches POV, attributing external observation to an internal narrator.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and purposeful, with high information density (“music from a dozen floats clashed while the scent of fried funnel cakes mingled with saltwater”). Occasional overwriting in mid-section (“reorganizing the scattered wisdom into strategies”) edges toward abstraction. No loops or scaffold, but one paraphrase pair (“partial victory” / “favorable terms”) slightly dulls momentum. Final paragraph’s rhythm masterfully echoes opening, creating charged poise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gentrification resistance through nautical graffiti coding feels inevitable in hindsight. The floating city isn’t whimsy—it’s a logical crucible for impermanent, adaptive culture. Risk-taking (silent protagonist, no dialogue, abstract stakes) heightens thematic resonance without gimmickry. Avoids template plots by rooting rebellion in visual literacy and intergenerational transmission, not confrontation.</comment>
