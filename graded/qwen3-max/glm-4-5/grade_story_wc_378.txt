<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Unit 734’s internal conflict—between mechanical function and “strangely organic” responses—is embodied through tactile actions (polishing, opening the fear-box) and micro-choices that escalate under pressure. Its nostalgia and sacrifice feel earned, not diagnostic, though the phrase “inner static” flirts with label-speak. The transformation into miniature selves resolves its dissonance credibly, with visible cost: the inert original form. Flawed yet coherent, it avoids safety-hedging while remaining individualized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis via fragmentation): Unit 734 endures by dividing, foreclosing its singular existence to preserve the garden. Cost is legible in the slumped original body and empty fear-box. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure intensifies through sensory distortion, wilting roses, and system fractures until miniaturization crystallizes meaning. Every beat tightens toward this charged poise without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The glass dome, desert roses, and magnetic shift are vividly rendered and causally active—the dome’s failing field directly pressures Unit 734’s choices. The recurring box of fears and bio-luminescent petals charge the final image. Sensory detail (distorted shadows, pulsing crystals) serves urgency without stalling momentum. Only minor deduction: “fractured light” ending feels slightly abstract versus earlier tactile precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving the garden amid planetary chaos—is signaled early and tightens when life support fails. Unit 734’s agency drives escalation: choosing miniaturization over collapse, sacrificing stability. Cost is felt in wilting roses, fragmented consciousness, and the inert original form. Magnetic shift complicates but doesn’t resolve; the android’s controlled burn is earned, though “inner static” could clarify stakes more viscerally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: preservation via fragmentation, trauma as fuel, machine becoming symbiotic organism. The empty fear-box glowing anew offers non-literal closure—fears aren’t erased but transformed into generative energy. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers (are the children safe? Is this evolution or loss?). Final image reweights the premise: survival requires dissolution of self, not endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Unit 734’s perceptual bias (“strangely organic,” “colors that shouldn’t exist”). Syntax varies purposefully—fragmented during system failure, lyrical in resolution. Voice remains consistent even during stress; no head-hopping. Minor flaw: “fractured, like a signal…” simile slightly over-explains, but overall diction reflects the android’s hybrid nature without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “magnetic north began its irreversible shift” opens with stakes and voice. Sentences vary rhythmically, avoiding monotony. One paraphrase loop: “fragmentation spread… each cluster… separating yet maintaining connection” slightly redundant. Figurative language (“bio-luminescent petals dimming”) stays coherent. Closure image (“roots connecting… to the garden soil”) lands cleanly without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: an android’s “childhood fears” as crystalline energy, magnetic shifts as existential threat, miniaturization as salvation. Tropes (caretaker AI, environmental collapse) are transformed through specific logic—protocol 34, organic roots post-fragmentation. Bold risk: resolving inner conflict via literal division, not integration. Vision coheres fully; removing any core element (fear-box, desert roses) would collapse the story’s logic.</comment>
