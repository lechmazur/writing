<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is consistent and embodied—her desire to “salvage something pure” drives tangible choices, especially her careful dream interventions. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are filtered through sensory detail (“glass strangely warm,” “voice like the sound of ice forming”). However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in-scene—it’s more sequential than layered. The final renunciation (choosing gentle revelation over accusation) is earned, with visible cost in emotional labor and restraint.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s shrine moment crystallizes justice-as-healing, reweighting the entire narrative. The causal lens holds—each discovery leads because/therefore to the next, culminating in descendants’ voluntary confessions. Cost is legible in the captain’s release and the snow globe’s transformation. Orientation anchors instantly (“frigid waters,” “wreck-diver gear”), and the two-shard structure (ocean → glacier) transitions cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The melted snow globe functions as micro-setting—its warmth in cold water and later glow constrain tactics and charge the ending. Glacier shrine isn’t postcard description; its candlelight and frozen tears actively shape ritual and perception. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara’s priorities (tactile glass, visual candle flicker), and environment evolves causally (coral-encrusted beams → clear altar). Only slight deduction: ocean chill vs. warm glass risks physics amnesia, but magical realism cues mitigate this.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (“salvage purity from lies”) tightens meaningfully when Elara chooses indirect dream exposure over public accusation—a trade-off that forecloses vengeance but enables healing. Pressure escalates via ghostly fragments forcing moral calculus: truth must be handled carefully to avoid shattering the living. Agency is clear (she initiates dream visits), and cost appears in emotional labor and ethical restraint. Minor deduction: sabotage backstory arrives via summary, slightly softening the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: truth as healing, not weaponization. The snow globe’s shift from “melted” to “glowing” reweights “purity” from object to process. Final image offers non-literal answer—windows open to “pure hearts”—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (captain’s unspoken sacrifice) and implication (descendants’ guilt). No thematic echo or abstraction; wisdom arises from concrete dream-weaving and coral-encrusted beams.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices warmth in cold, candle shadows as whispers. Voice modulates rhythmically: short clauses under ocean pressure (“After hours of searching…”), lyrical flow in shrine scenes. Diction stays within plausible lexicon (“borrowed starlight” feels character-bound, not ornamental). No head-hopping; even dream sequences remain filtered through Elara’s conduit role. Slight register drift in “windows of connection” phrasing, but pattern-taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive—“coral-encrusted beams,” “frozen tears” do double duty. Figurative language is restrained in high-pressure beats (ocean search uses concrete verbs: “cutting,” “nestled”). Minor scaffold: “piecing together a pattern the spirits were trying to expose” slightly paraphrases prior “fragments.” Final paragraph’s “woven truth carefully until it became something beautiful” edges toward abstraction but is anchored by the glowing snow globe. No loops or syntactic monotony; read-aloud rhythm varies effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Premise transforms tropes: ghost whisperer as ethical mediator, not avenger; snow globe as truth-conduit, not cliché memento. Specificity abounds—glacier shrine, insurance fraud cover-up, cameo dream appearances. Emotional truth prioritized over novelty; captain’s sacrifice gains depth via daughter’s pre-death gift. Risk-taking (truth via dreams) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Only near-echo: “borrowed starlight” borders on familiar, but integration into action (“appearing in dreams as borrowed starlight”) freshens it.</comment>
