<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her somatic markers, scarred hands, and ritual with the photograph reveal trauma without therapy-speak. Her contradictory impulses (holding onto joy while releasing pain) act simultaneously in the climax. The final release of the photo is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. Minor deduction for slightly idealized emotional calibration under extreme stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Maya releases the photograph, crystallizing her stance to hold love and loss together. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through recurring images (photo, oyster shell, breath) until the cadence shift at the cliff’s edge reweights realism and optimism. Cost is legible in her physical stillness after release. Orientation anchors are clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The arboretum, cliff, and sea aren’t backdrop—they constrain and charge every choice: the salt air shapes plant survival, the lighthouse’s absence deepens isolation, and the cliff enables the photograph’s release. The oyster shell micro-setting directly births the “pearl of stillness” concept. Final image of Maya arms outstretched over churning sea ties environment to thematic closure. All sensory detail filters through Maya’s botanical focus and trauma.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—anchoring optimism in realism—is signaled early and tightens when children ask to learn stillness, forcing Maya to externalize her private ritual. The anniversary cliff scene deepens pressure: somatic markers surge, but she chooses integration over collapse. Cost is felt in her relinquishment of the photo, a live option foreclosed. Slight deduction: escalation leans more on internal rhythm than external pressure shifts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Maya’s grafting hands, the oyster shell, and the photograph—not stated but shown. The ending reweights the central question (“Can joy and pain coexist?”) through action: releasing the image doesn’t erase love but integrates loss. No moralizing; resonance arises from the wind carrying the photo into the sea while Maya remains rooted. Subtext thrives in gesture—the children’s unknowing reverence contrasts her hidden history.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: botanical precision meets lyrical restraint (“coax life from fragile cuttings,” “pearl of stillness”). Prose modulates with pressure—shorter sentences during panic, fluid cadence in calm. POV stays tightly focalized; even reflection is anchored in tactile cues (crumpled photo, cool earth). No head-hopping; perceptual signature consistent (notices plants before people, reads bodies for somatic signals).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully—breath-like pauses during stillness rituals, urgency in panic sequences. One minor artifact: “quietly talented” appears twice with near-identical phrasing (lines 3 and 71), triggering a −0.2 loop penalty. Otherwise, zero scaffold, no purple prose, and metaphors remain coherent (oyster → stillness → resilience).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms war trauma tropes through specificity: a botanist’s somatic coping, not a soldier’s; healing via grafting, not talking. The “pearl of stillness” reframes resilience as iridescence within weathering—fresh yet inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric structure, no dialogue-driven plot) heightens thematic clarity. Deduction for slight proximity to familiar “trauma + nature” templates, though execution elevates it.</comment>
