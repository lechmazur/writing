<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The oracle’s interiority is vividly embodied through tactile perception (pebbles, gold leaf) and obsessive focus on silence, avoiding diagnostic labels. Her shift from mild obsession to violent determination feels earned via escalating pressure of the vanishing star and encroaching darkness. Micro-choices—selecting specific pebbles, sketching voids—reveal her hierarchy of values. The final renunciation (guiding through darkness rather than preventing it) carries conceptual cost, fulfilling Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the oracle’s map redefines endless night as a navigable canvas, not a curse. Cost is legible in her relinquished hope of prevention and the societal terror below. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density of silence imagery intensifies until the final glow-from-darkness reversal. Orientation is immediate (“pebble-shore oracle,” “storm-tossed ridge fort”) with no disorientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting functions as micro-setting: the flaking gold leaf booklet and three pebbles constrain choices (sketching voids, selecting stones) and charge the closure (booklet glows from darkness-sketches). Storm and vanishing star pressure decisions without cliché. Sensory detail is selective (marbled hush, warm pebble) and filtered through the oracle’s obsession. Final image ties setting directly to thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mapping endless night—is signaled early and tightens when the last star vanishes, forcing the oracle to accept darkness as canvas. Agency is clear: her choice to “summarize silence” forecloses resistance, embracing guidance. Cost is conceptual (abandoning prevention) but unmistakable. Escalation follows Accumulative lens—silence deepens, pebbles speak through presence—though external pressure (storm, masses below) remains slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: darkness as path, not obstacle. Subtext thrives in void-sketches and unsaid pebble “speech,” avoiding moralizing. Final line (“endless night was not an end but a beginning”) resonates non-literally by reweighting prior images (vanishing star, glowing voids). Complexity persists—torch-lighters will fail, survival requires surrender to silence—without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled single-third with a distinct perceptual signature: noticing silence textures, stone temperatures, flaking gold. Voice modulates rhythmically—longer sentences for contemplation, fragments for urgency (“Total darkness claimed the sky”). Syntax mirrors obsession (“sketching not lines... but voids”). No head-hopping; diction stays within oracle’s lexicon (no academic intrusions).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ambered hush,” “marbled silence” avoid purple excess by grounding metaphors in action (fingers tracing, candles guttering). Minor overwriting in “veins of different minerals in stone” slightly muddles, but closure beat (“glow with gentle light”) remains clear. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary. One near-redundancy (“profound stillness that fell between heartbeats and words” / “ambered hush”) costs 0.3.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis: prophecy via silence-mapping subverts oracle tropes. Pebble-shore specificity (echo-futures in stones) and “ambered hush” concept feel fresh yet inevitable. Risk-taking (plot hinges on absence) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision coheres—every element serves the core idea that darkness must be traversed, not fought—with irreplaceable details (warm-as-flesh pebble, flaking gold).</comment>
