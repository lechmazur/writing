<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tutor’s interiority is concrete and consistent, with embodied guilt driving micro-choices (e.g., decoding threads as penance). His arc from arrogance to humility feels earned through decades of reflection tied to present action. The prince’s silent presence at the end crystallizes relational stakes without dialogue. However, the final reconciliation leans slightly toward unearned grace—his self-forgiveness arrives cleanly despite minimal resistance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): time restarts only after the tutor accepts his role in the tragedy, making redemption contingent on internal change. The causal lens holds—each thread decoded tightens pressure and reweights memory. Cost is legible: forty years of exile, penance etched into his face, and the bell’s sound breaking decades of silence. The labyrinth’s door appears only when humility replaces pride—a rule established early and honored precisely.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The time-frozen village isn’t backdrop but active constraint: suspended villagers, magical storm rhythms, and the platinum labyrinth shape every choice. Sensory detail is selective—the “woven hush” absorbs sound, thunder marks time, threads carry history—never decorative. The labyrinth’s liquid-metal walls respond to intention, charging the final image. All key setting elements directly enable or foreclose action, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness through truth—is signaled early and deepens via the tapestry’s decoding. Agency is clear: the tutor chooses to confront memories, not flee. Escalation follows the causal lens—each restored thread narrows options until the prince’s hand becomes the only path. Cost is felt: forty years lost, irreversible aging, and the ever-ticking thunder-clock that forces speed under duress.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: redemption requires self-forgiveness, not external absolution. Subtext lives in objects—the frayed tapestry as fractured memory, fidgeting as transformed anxiety. The ending avoids moralizing; instead, the bell’s chime and restarting time reprice silence as both prison and teacher. Slight deduction for the phrase “meaning of redemption,” which borders on abstract summary, though it’s offset by concrete closure imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through the tutor’s strategic perception (“tutor’s eyes for pattern”). Voice modulates rhythmically—longer sentences during reflection, staccato urgency as thunder nears. Diction reflects chess logic (“winnow,” “calculated strategy”) without jargon. No head-hopping; even the prince’s understanding is rendered through the tutor’s hopeful projection, maintaining focal integrity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful—most lines multitask (e.g., “fingers fidgeted productively” establishes trait, history, and present action). Minor overwriting in mid-story (“misleading memories that had accumulated like dust”) edges toward cliché but doesn’t obscure causality. Sentence variety supports momentum; paragraph cuts align with pressure shifts. One paraphrase loop (“woven hush… magical silence… suffocating blanket”) slightly dulls the artifact, preventing 8.5+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: frozen time as psychological purgatory, chess as metaphor for political miscalculation, redemption through textile archaeology. Tropes are grounded in specific mechanics—the four-minute lull, thread-decoding as therapy. The “platinum labyrinth” feels inevitable yet surprising. Risk-taking (silent village, non-dialogue climax) heightens thematic focus without gimmickry, though the forgiving prince verges on archetypal.</comment>
