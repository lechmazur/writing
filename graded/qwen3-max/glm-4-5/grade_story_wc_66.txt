<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The copyist’s motivation—teaching dust to tell stories—is rooted in lived trauma from the story famine and manifests through precise, embodied actions (ink-stained fingers, whispered lyrics). Her internal contradiction (diligent functionary vs. revolutionary) is consistent but under-pressurized; we see her calm resolve but not meaningful struggle or error under threat. The final choice lacks a visible cost beyond implied risk, weakening Earned Stasis. No secondary characters appear, so relationship dynamics don’t apply.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Orientation is clear by line 30: who (copyist), where (ember alcove), when (post-famine night). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds via sensory density (ink, mist, dust shimmer) and cadence shifts toward broadcast climax. Closure is Charged Poise: her quiet walk home crystallizes stakes (stories as water) with conceptual cost (a world relearning how to dream). Dust’s role as invisible carrier pays off the early archive discovery, satisfying pattern coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ember alcove, mist, and radio dial glow form a micro-setting that constrains choice (hiding spot enables broadcast) and charges the final image (dust dancing in moonlight). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: the copyist notices ink stains, dial luminescence, and thistled calm because they reflect her covert labor. The alcove’s isolation directly enables her subversion—without it, no broadcast. Weather (mist) evolves causally, swirling in response to her voice, deepening atmosphere without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freedom of narrative—is signaled early and tightens via the act of cloaking tales in song lyrics, which narrows options (must avoid detection). The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: she chooses frequency, lyrics, and dust-based transmission. Cost is conceptual (risk of capture) but not viscerally dramatized; we’re told authorities seek her, yet no near-miss or consequence appears. Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening (dust mechanics revealed) suffices, though a tangible loss would heighten pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: stories as essential as water, resistance through ephemeral beauty. The dust motif shifts from archival residue to active storyteller, culminating in the final image of shimmering particles—a non-literal answer to “how do silenced voices return?” Subtext thrives in song lyrics masking rebellion. No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete particulars (bowls of water collecting dust). The copyist’s arc embodies the theme without stating it, avoiding pseudo-profundity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and deeply filtered through the copyist’s professional and subversive identity. Voice has distinct texture: lyrical but precise (“thistled calm,” “secretly luminous beacon”), with rhythmic control that breathes during broadcast tension. No dialogue, so speech tests don’t apply. Prose modulates under pressure—sentences shorten subtly during tuning sequence. Perceptual signature is strong: she notices musical scores, ink, frequencies, not generic details. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, though minor overwriting occurs (“mist-shrouded hillside,” “thistled calm” risks preciousness). One paraphrase loop: “silent and forgotten” / “forgotten remember and the silenced speak.” Sentence openings vary well; paragraph cuts serve rhythm. Figurative language is coherent (dust as storyteller, stories as water) but slightly dense in mid-section. Final image (“dust would continue to whisper”) lands cleanly without scaffold. No grammar errors or simultaneity flaws.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise transforms dystopian tropes via specific, grounded ingenuity: dust as undetectable narrative medium feels fresh and logically extrapolated. Emotional truth anchors novelty—the copyist’s grief for lost bedtime stories makes her mission urgent. Risk-taking (lyric-as-cloak, dust physics) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision is singular: bureaucratic control vs. granular, natural resistance. No derivative echoes; concept commits fully to its implications (water bowls, humming archives). Bold yet cohesive.</comment>
