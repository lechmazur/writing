<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s ambition and sensory gift are concretely embodied, not merely stated; her internal conflict between urgency and the need for stillness manifests in micro-choices (e.g., doodling the spiral, choosing to sit with the stench). Thessaly functions as a pressure valve, not a plot device, and their exchange reveals hierarchy of values without exposition. The final endurance—sitting amid the corpse flower’s reek—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through scent, journaling, and motion until the climax crystallizes into Charged Poise: Mira’s stillness amid chaos. Orientation is immediate (“treetop village of Velmara”), stakes clear by paragraph two, and closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost—wisdom requires surrender, not acquisition. The “turning of the tide’s thought” motif deepens rather than resolves, perfectly serving the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The treetop village isn’t backdrop—it constrains every choice: bridges sway, platforms shift, and stillness must be cultivated within motion. Cedar bark, mist, wildflowers, and the seed’s “bruised plum” hue are filtered through Mira’s olfactory POV, never catalogued. The setting charges the final image: Mira breathes the same complex air while harvesting medicine, proving she’s integrated the village’s lesson.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—saving sick children via the corpse seed—is signaled early and deepens when Thessaly reframes success as inner stillness, not mere acquisition. The tightening occurs when Mira realizes the real test isn’t climbing but enduring the bloom’s stench. Cost is legible: she must forfeit her frantic ambition to access healing, and the final image shows her transformed tactics—quiet, present, journaling amid horror.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: wisdom hides in overlooked spaces, healing wears an ugly face, serenity lives within motion. No moralizing—the insight arrives through Mira’s grandmother’s doodles and Thessaly’s clay pot, culminating in the charged final image of monstrous petals yielding medicine. The recurring spiral and wrapping paper reweight earlier acts, offering a non-literal answer: true knowledge is received, not seized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose embodies Mira’s perceptual signature—olfactory, tactile, visually sparse—through rhythmic control that breathes with scene pressure. Sentences shorten during tension (“Sit.” “Breathe.”), expand in reflection. Dialogue is minimal but potent, carrying subtext (“You seek the corpse seed”—not a question). No head-hopping; single POV remains tightly focalized, with diction rooted in herbalist lexicon without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High information density: “mottled seed the color of bruised plums” conveys appearance, texture, and metaphor in one phrase. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or stakes. Figurative language is purposeful (“ambition…a wildfire”) and consistent, never muddling peak beats. Final paragraph’s cadence—“sketching the monstrous petals while the children's medicine dripped”—perfectly fuses action, image, and cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms the “quest for rare herb” trope through specificity: olfactory POV, wrapping-paper journaling, treetop choreography. The corpse flower’s paradox—foul bloom, healing seed—mirrors thematic core without allegory. Risk-taking (lyric pacing, minimal dialogue) heightens stakes by making stillness the climax. Vision feels singular: a world where scent reads secrets and wisdom hides in discarded paper.</comment>
