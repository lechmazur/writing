<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete and contradictory: she refuses violence yet keeps a blade, speaks to plants yet carries her father’s legacy of hunting. Her micro-choices—granting entry, weaving ballast into seed trays—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final renunciation (“She would never hunt”) is earned through prior causality and embodies Earned Stasis. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied in soil-stained hands and trembling sheaths.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mira’s refusal to harvest violence crystallizes into a quiet rebellion against entropy, with tangible cost (isolation, vulnerability). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story deepens through recurring motifs (ballast, roses, silence) that reweight meaning. The stranger’s arrival tightens pressure without resolving it mechanically; the dome remains a fragile sanctuary. Cost is legible in the final image: “patient as petals waiting for their season.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The glass-domed enclosure functions as both setting and micro-setting: it constrains choice (Mira stays within its bounds), shapes tactics (irrigation, shelter), and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—“desert heat pressed against transparent walls like a living thing”—filtered through Mira’s perceptual bias. The “tranquil blaze” tonally mirrors her internal paradox. Environment directly enables the thematic closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cultivating meaning amid collapse—is signaled early and deepens when the stranger arrives bearing ballast scrap. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to admit him, interrogate the fabric, weave it into her practice. The cost is felt in vulnerability (opening the dome) and emotional labor (teaching). Under an Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through density of symbolic action, not external threat, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration of purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: ballast becomes metaphor for balance, roses for resilience, silence for deliberate resistance. No moralizing; the final image—cuttings wrapped in ballast, carried into the world—offers a non-literal answer to chaos: continuity through care. Subtext lives in gesture (sheathing the blade, pressing soil) and silence. The central question—can meaning root in ruin?—is answered through action, not assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled, single-focalizer with a distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices chemical whispers in leaves, pressure shifts before storms. Voice modulates with emotional intensity—lyric in reflection, taut in confrontation. Syntax varies purposefully; short sentences heighten tension (“She walked to the dome's entrance and waited”). No head-hopping; even the stranger’s exhaustion is filtered through Mira’s observation. Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying subtext (“Plants can't learn values” / “Everything learns what we repeat”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“tranquil blaze,” “silence carved deliberately”) and pays off in closure. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create rhythm. High information density: “Ballast. Balance. The thing that kept you level when winds sought to tear you apart.” Final line resonates without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes through specificity: not survival, but cultivation; not rebuilding, but weaving continuity. The bounty hunter’s pacifist daughter subverts expectation without gimmickry. Originality lies in the fusion of horticulture and ethics, where ballast sandbags become seed covers. Risk-taking (quiet rebellion as climax) heightens stakes coherently. Vision feels singular, not templated.</comment>
