<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s motivation—curiosity fused with professional integrity—drives every key decision, from investigating the terminal to championing Chen’s design. Her internal conflict between institutional expectations and personal vision is embodied in tactile choices (e.g., pocketing the sextant, rerouting flows). The final act of submitting an alternative proposal earns its weight through 40 hours of obsessive labor, not epiphany. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in duraglass, dust motes, and brass.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Maya’s choice crystallizes options (“forward”) while the cost—accepting partial restoration amid systemic decay—is felt in the “mathematics of realistic dreams.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of layered failures (carnival departure, committee’s demolition order) intensifies until Chen’s design offers a cadence shift. Cost is legible in the final image: emergency lights “steadied into something that almost resembled warmth”—not triumph, but fragile persistence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The abandoned terminal isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint and resource. Shattered skylights, frozen departure boards, and Chen’s water system directly shape Maya’s tactics. The sextant (micro-setting) charges the final image by linking past and present navigation. Sensory detail (rust-colored desert, oil-stained cloth, flickering holograms) filters through Maya’s engineer-POV, never touristy. Environment and object jointly enable the hydro-turbine solution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—saving the terminal—tightens when the reclamation committee demands demolition, forcing Maya to choose between compliance and innovation. Her agency drives escalation: tracing blueprints, mapping Chen’s philosophy, rerouting flows. The cost—accepting “one section” instead of full revival—is visible in her proposal’s modest scope. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each discovery (sextant, water system) deepens commitment without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: “maze of intentions” in architecture mirrors Maya’s struggle to find coherence in chaos. The sextant reweights “navigation” from destination-fixation to directional courage. Final line—“She chose forward”—offers non-literal answer to the central question: how to act amid ruin. No moralizing; resonance lives in brass coordinates and hydro-turbines, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Maya notices stress fractures before emotions, systems before symbols. Prose rhythm modulates—long, vaulted sentences for desolation; clipped clauses for engineering focus. Free indirect style cleanly merges technical lexicon (“natural pressure differentials”) with wonder (“ghost-glow,” “starlight”). No head-hopping; single POV remains anchored in tactile observation even during reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density: “departure gate frozen mid-countdown” conveys time, failure, and hope in one image. Syntax varies purposefully—fragments for impact (“Just one.”), complex sentences for systemic thinking. Minor overwriting in “abstract art” metaphor, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence (“Navigation wasn’t… It was…”) avoids purple prose by grounding insight in concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms “abandoned spaceport” trope through engineering specificity: water reclamation via gravity wells, not magic. Sextant as relic of obsolete navigation reframes progress as continuity, not replacement. Risk-taking in quiet climax—no grand rescue, just a turbine—heightens stakes by embracing limitation. Vision feels singular: stoic wonder rooted in fluid dynamics and brass craftsmanship, not generic sci-fi nostalgia.</comment>
