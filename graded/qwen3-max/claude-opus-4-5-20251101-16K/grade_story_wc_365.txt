<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera’s motivation—driven by the unbearable weight of not knowing—is embodied in tactile, profession-specific choices (sensory mapping, interpreting environmental shifts) rather than abstract longing. Her internal conflict between obedience (“Don’t look for me”) and compulsion (“never been good at leaving things buried”) acts simultaneously in-scene, culminating in a credible, costly renunciation: stepping backward into annihilation. The shard’s warmth, the mother’s fragmented memories, and Vera’s professional discipline fuse into a coherent, flawed individuality. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through sensory labor and micro-decisions under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the origin universe isn’t lost—it was murdered, and Vera now carries the burden of that truth. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—sensory data accrues until patterns converge backward, reweighting every prior map. Cost is legible in the final image: “gravity of collapsed stars” pressing on her shoulders as she steps into erased history. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when anchored by line 3), and the shard’s cyclic mechanics pay off without retroactive patches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The repair bay functions as micro-setting: rust that “never finished its work,” subsonic hum, oxidized steel—all constrain Vera’s sensory mapping and signal dimensional instability. The green shard (tool/object-as-setting) directly charges the closure: its warmth contrasts the chill, its song dictates timing, its origin defines the stakes. Environmental details evolve causally (amber to silver light, temperature drop) and mirror internal revelation. Every sensory cue serves pressure or choice—no white-room syndrome or decorative cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the withheld truth—is signaled early and deepens when Vera realizes she’s been searching forward instead of backward. The “REDIRECT” revelation narrows options decisively: only by returning to the origin can she grasp the genocide. Escalation is driven by Vera’s agency (interpreting maps, choosing thresholds), not coincidence. Cost is felt immediately: the moral weight of her mother’s dimensional genocide reconfigures her mission from pursuit to reckoning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the interplay of memory, erasure, and cartography: truth isn’t found but reconstructed from sensory fragments, and some knowledge carries gravitational cost. The final image—Vera stepping into the ghost of a murdered universe—offers a non-literal answer: understanding requires inhabiting the void left by destruction. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers (What threat justified genocide?), yet the emotional aftereffect is concrete: resolve tempered by dread. The shard’s recurrence shifts from heirloom to key to burden, charging closure without symbolic shouting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled single-third, with a perceptual signature rooted in Vera’s profession: she notices humidity percentages, vibration frequencies, light spectra. Syntax modulates with pressure—longer, fluid sentences during mapping; clipped, visceral phrasing during threshold crossings (“The shard flared”). Voice remains consistent even in reflection (“half-remembered dreams” filtered through sensory logic). No head-hopping, no register drift; diction stays within a mapmaker’s plausible lexicon, even at peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: “rust never finished its work” implies suspended time; “time felt like honey” conveys viscosity without cliché. Sentences vary rhythmically, paragraph cuts align with pressure shifts, and every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor deduction for slight overuse of figurative language in the dream sequence (“memories that weren’t hers flickered”), but no loops, scaffold, or muddle. Final lines (“she had spent a lifetime learning to carry weight”) resonate without summarizing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in fusing hard-SF concepts (dimensional travel, sensory cartography) with intimate grief, avoiding tropey “chosen one” or “mystical artifact” pitfalls. The shard’s mechanics are grounded in biological rhythm (12-hour cycles), and the genocide twist reframes maternal love as catastrophic protection. Risk-taking—nonlinear search, conceptual closure—heightens stakes without gimmickry. The synthesis feels inevitable: a mapmaker navigating the unmappable, bearing the weight of erased worlds.</comment>
