<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands contrast with her pragmatic resolve, and her deception carries palpable moral weight. Her contradictory impulses (protection vs. honesty) act simultaneously in scene, especially when she admits her lie to Inspector Chen. The final choice—to offer the cracked marble—is earned by prior causality and reveals a hierarchy of values: truth beneath deception, relationship over metrics. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile ritual and horticultural intimacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the demolition order is “lost,” not revoked, preserving ambiguity while crystallizing stakes. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens through layered images (cracks, blooming/withering) that reweight “luck” as relational recognition. Cost is legible: three years of fear, isolation, and ethical burden. The central fountain scene ties past manipulation to present revelation without retroactive patches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The garden maze functions as both setting and micro-setting—it pressures choices (e.g., sensor placement during flowering) and charges the final image (hedges leaning toward Mara). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: Mara notices leaf tremors, vine brushes, rose orientations. The recurring marbles, cracked and polished, constrain her emotional economy and culminate in the inspector’s palm. Environment actively shapes tactics and meaning, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving the maze against bureaucratic erasure—is signaled early and tightens through Mara’s escalating deceptions. The meaningful deepening occurs when she shifts from manipulation to proof: “not by perfecting lies, but by proving the truth beneath them.” Protagonist agency drives escalation; cost is visible in her trembling hands and moral fatigue. The inspector’s arrival forces a crystallization of stance, not coincidence, and the final trade-off (truth for mercy) carries social and existential weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: gardens thrive through mutual recognition, not quantifiable luck. The cracked marbles reprice “fortune” as relational fidelity, not data. Subtext operates in gesture—Mara polishing fractures, vines brushing her shoulders—and the ending offers a non-literal answer: the inspector’s quiet complicity reweights the entire premise. No moralizing; resonance arises from the tactile ritual and the hedges’ eternal dance, inviting reflection without resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Mara’s horticultural perception (“yellowed leaves she pruned,” “roses turned their faces”). Voice modulates with pressure: lyrical cadence in dawn walks, terse clarity in confrontation. Dialogue is sparse but distinct—Mara’s plainspoken wisdom contrasts with the inspector’s clinical diction, converging only in shared awe. Syntax and rhythm reflect her aging body and steady resolve, never slipping into exposition or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information density: “Numbers replaced intuition” compresses worldbuilding and conflict. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths mirror thematic rhythm (short during tension, longer in reflection). No paraphrase loops or scaffold—every image serves character or theme. Figurative language is coherent (“hands shook like yellowed leaves”) and never muddles closure. Minor deduction for slight overuse of em-dashes in mid-text, but no artifacts impair clarity or propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise transforms bureaucratic absurdity into lyrical resistance through specific, grounded details: cracked luck-spheres, sensor-timing tricks, hedges that lean inward. The synthesis of measurement culture and horticultural reciprocity feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk: making the garden sentient through subtle behavior, not magic. Originality lies in emotional specificity—Mara’s rebellion is quiet, tactile, and rooted in decades of care, avoiding generic dystopian tropes.</comment>
