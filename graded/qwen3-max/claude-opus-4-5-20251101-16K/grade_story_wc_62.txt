<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Miriam’s interiority is concrete and profession-specific—her grief is carved, not merely felt. Her contradictory impulses (holding on vs. letting go) manifest in "fierce meditation" and the struggle to design a collective memorial. The final choice—to spiral the names—is earned through ancestral knowledge and embodied craft, with visible cost in her solitude and labor. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in ribbon rolls, stone curves, and butterfly wings.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: collective grief is “one loss with many names,” crystallized in the spiral memorial. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the monarch migration, poems, and greenhouse visits layer into a thundering calm of understanding. Cost is legible: Miriam must walk others’ paths to read all names, embodying shared burden. Orientation anchors instantly (“October,” “greenhouse,” “Miriam”), and the ghostly mentorship functions as pressure, not deus ex machina.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse isn’t backdrop—it’s crucible. Cracked panes, overgrown ferns, and dying light constrain Miriam’s meditation and host the monarchs’ pilgrimage. The woven ribbon and stone-carving tools function as micro-setting, directly shaping the memorial’s form. Final image charges the setting: darkness filled with wings becomes a vessel for inherited memory. Every sensory detail serves theme and closure without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—shaping collective grief—is signaled early and deepens when Miriam realizes individual monuments won’t suffice. The tightening comes via her grandmother’s command: “Retrace.” This forces Miriam into ancestral archives and poetic memory, narrowing her options to pattern-based design. Cost is felt in her isolation and the weight of communal expectation. Escalation is driven by her agency, not coincidence, under an Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as inherited map, grief as shared architecture. The monarchs’ migration mirrors generational transmission of craft and verse. Final image reweights everything—butterflies carrying the dead “through the bodies of those who remembered how to fly”—without moralizing. Subtext lives in spiral names, ribbon measurements, and unspoken grandmotherly presence; no prompt-like thesis statement mars the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, shaped by a carver’s tactile lexicon (“woven ribbon roll,” “cracked glass panes”). POV remains tightly focalized; even spectral dialogue feels weighted, not auditory. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity—longer sentences during reflection, fragmented awe at climax (“That’s the shape”). No head-hopping, register drift, or filter-verb stacks; prose embodies Miriam’s “fierce” attention throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: “orange wings catching October light like stained glass” does atmosphere, character, and motif in one. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths mirror breath and beat. One minor artifact: “thundering calm of understanding descended” slightly risks mixed metaphor, but it pays off in the bell-vibration image immediately after. No loops, scaffolding, or redundancy—every line advances story, character, or texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms familiar tropes (ghost mentors, butterfly migrations) through specific craft: gravestone carving as dialogue with the dead, poems passed like bread. The spiral memorial reimagines collective mourning as kinetic, participatory architecture. Risk-taking (lyric structure, spectral presence) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular—no template echoes; every detail roots in Miriam’s world and wound.</comment>
