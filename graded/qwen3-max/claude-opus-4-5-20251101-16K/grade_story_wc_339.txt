<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is precise and embodied—her analytical restraint clashes credibly with trembling hands and a withheld truth. The snow globe triggers micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values: protecting fragile meaning over professional validation. Her grief isn’t summarized but enacted through tactile caution and selective silence. The final smile earns its weight because her emotional calibration degrades under pressure yet remains consistent with her core trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: time isn’t linear, love persists in displaced frequencies. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds via artifacts (logs, wire recordings, snow globe) until the radio log reweights everything. Cost is legible in Elara’s decision to withhold the truth, sacrificing closure for others to protect the transmission’s sacred privacy. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 30; causality holds despite temporal paradox because rules are established through discovery, not convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sunken library functions as micro-setting: rusted door preserves evidence, water pressure shapes movement, darkness demands headlamp focus. The snow globe’s internal storm mirrors Elara’s turmoil without overt symbolism. Tactile specificity—oilcloth, pulp books, metal cabinets—grounds the impossible premise in sensory plausibility. Final image of the glowing lighthouse charges closure because the environment constrains what can be known and carried upward.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—achieving closure through evidence—tightens when the Persephone log reframes “lost” as “displaced.” Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to photograph, conceal, and ascend without sharing. Cost is felt in her isolation; she bears knowledge no colleague would believe. Coincidence (Earhart’s discovery) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the real turn comes from her methodical untangling, not external luck.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: snow globe, radio static, lighthouse glow. “Physics of letting go” isn’t moralized but reweighted as acceptance of non-linear existence. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer—love persists in undetectable frequencies—without stating a thesis. Ambiguity lingers (is the glow real or perceptual?), yet emotional honesty avoids sentimentality through clinical restraint undercut by embodied tremor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: notices archival detail before emotion, uses maritime lexicon (“regulator,” “wire recordings”). Syntax tightens under stress (“Her hands trembled…”) then expands lyrically at ascent. No head-hopping; reflection is anchored to concrete cues (snow globe, radio log). Voice modulates from analytic to quietly awed without register drift or diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “sediment swirling like a private storm” does triple duty (image, mood, character). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths mirror dive rhythm—long immersion, short surfacing beats. One minor flaw: “methodical work by untangling threads” slightly abstracts action just before climax, costing full 9+. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; closure image (“lighthouse glowed faintly”) avoids purple prose while sustaining impossibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms “lost-at-sea” trope through quantum grief—closure isn’t recovery but resonance across time folds. Specificity (1939 Meridian, 1999 Persephone, oilcloth-wrapped logs) grounds speculative premise. Risk-taking (non-linear time as emotional framework) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final synthesis feels inevitable: the snow globe heirloom was always a temporal artifact, making mother’s message retroactively coherent.</comment>
