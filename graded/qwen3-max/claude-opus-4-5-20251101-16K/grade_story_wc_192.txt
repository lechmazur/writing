<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her renunciation of connection wars with her instinct to heal, embodied in micro-choices like staying instead of fleeing. The girl’s posture triggers visceral recognition, not exposition. Scars function as lived history, not symbols, and Mira’s final decision to keep the sanctuary open carries visible emotional cost. No therapy-speak; emotions arise through breath, ash, and withheld touch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mira reopens her threshold despite knowing it will demand future farewells, crystallizing her role as keeper. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens through layered silence, starlight, and ash until the final image reweights solitude as shared stewardship. Cost is legible in “burn this bridge carefully too,” acknowledging cyclical sacrifice. Orientation anchors are precise by line 30; causality flows through sensory accumulation, not plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The charcoal sanctuary isn’t backdrop—it constrains choice (Mira stays because the space permits controlled vulnerability) and charges the final image (ash motes shimmering under stars). Sensory detail is selective: charred limbs, brass ring catching light, dust on tear-tracks—all filtered through Mira’s trauma-tuned perception. The doorknocker ring and pews evolve from relics to active conduits of memory and decision. Environment mirrors internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to let the world cross her threshold—is signaled early and tightens when the girl appears. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses presence over flight, then teaching over silence. Cost is unmistakable: reopening herself means future burnings. The “fading threshold” isn’t passive—it’s a pressure that compels stance crystallization under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: darkness as teacher, scars as language, emptiness as space for breath. The ending offers a non-literal answer—sanctuary isn’t isolation but temporary convergence—without moralizing. Subtext lives in what’s withheld (no embrace, no names) and in the ring’s dual function as closure and invitation. Resists binaries; healing isn’t cure but rhythm.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Mira notices thresholds, ash, starlight gaps—everything filtered through her keeper identity. Syntax modulates with pressure: short, breath-like sentences (“In. / Out.”) contrast lyrical density earlier. No head-hopping; even the girl’s dialogue feels sparse and age-appropriate. Voice remains consistent through reflection (grandmother’s ring) without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is purposeful (“charcoal trees stood like ancient mourners”) and never muddled. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Final line (“breath, stubborn and holy, continued”) earns its weight through prior restraint.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms familiar tropes (wounded healer, sanctuary) through specificity: “tender shadow keeper,” “burn bridges carefully,” ash as medium of communion. The synthesis of fire imagery (charcoal trees, burned chapel, scars) with breath creates an inevitable-yet-fresh arc. Risk-taking in lyric structure pays off without gimmickry. No template echoes; vision feels singular.</comment>
