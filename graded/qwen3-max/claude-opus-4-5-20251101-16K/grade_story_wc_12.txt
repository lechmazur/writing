<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Corrine’s internal contradiction—believing love must be earned while yearning for unconditional worth—is dramatized through embodied convulsions, whispered admissions, and tears, not therapy-speak. Mattias’s micro-choices (looping her truth, painting symbols) reveal his hierarchy of values: belief over command, sound over dogma. The entity’s voice contrasts sharply with Corrine’s fractured humanity, avoiding voice convergence. Her final renunciation of the mother’s lie is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Corrine’s rejection of unworthiness collapses the possession’s architecture. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the looping sound builds density until silence becomes a weapon—and holds coherently. Cost is legible in Corrine’s trembling body and the dissipated entity. The “unraveled stillness” reweaves only after her assumption is dismantled, proving the causal link between inner truth and dimensional equilibrium.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The dimensional anchor isn’t backdrop—it’s active pressure. Its shifting walls respond to sound architecture and possession intensity, constraining Mattias’s tactics. The palette, pedal, and Corrine’s body function as micro-settings that directly shape choices: Threshold Gray enables symbol-painting; the loop pedal captures truth as counter-frequency. Final image of saved silence charges the entire setting with thematic weight, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Corrine’s soul versus the entity exploiting her unworthiness—is signaled early and tightens when Mattias loops her whisper, foreclosing the entity’s anchoring option. Protagonist agency drives escalation: each question forces Corrine toward self-confrontation, altering the entity’s hold. Cost is unmistakable: Corrine’s trauma resurfaces (“My mother said I was too much”), and the room flickers into void under pressure. The clock (20 minutes) raises urgency without resolving via coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme—worthiness as a constructed lie—emerges through action, not assertion. The recurring motif of looping sound shifts meaning: from cage to healing balm to preserved silence. Final line (“saving it for the next soul”) offers non-literal answer: truth must be repeated to be believed, and healing is iterative. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether Mattias’s method can scale beyond intimate exorcism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Mattias notices sound textures, dimensional shifts, and emotional frequencies others wouldn’t. Rhythmic control under pressure—short sentences during convulsions, layered clauses during looping—mirrors his method. No head-hopping; even the entity’s dialogue is filtered through Mattias’s observation. Voice remains consistent in elevated but precise diction (“patient ghost,” “counter-frequency”), never slipping into academic register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “wind through broken glass,” “absorbed medicine,” “decorates with silence” do double duty. Minor flaw: slight overuse of figurative language in high-pressure beats (“threads of calm were stitching back together”) risks density overload, but pattern is taught early and pays off in closure. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final silence “crashed like a wave” perfectly modulates rhythm for climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: exorcism as sonic archaeology of self-worth, using loop pedals and dimensional physics instead of holy water. Tropes transformed—priest as sound artist, possession as exploitation of internalized shame. Risk-taking (lyric sci-fi theology) heightens stakes without gimmickry; the concept follows its implications to Earned Stasis. Irreplaceable specificity: only Threshold Gray and looping could resolve this exact wound.</comment>
