<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Unit-7’s interiority is concrete, embodied through sweeping and perception of the violin; its motivation—to find where thoughts come from—emerges organically and compels increasingly significant choices (noticing, then playing the violin). The final renunciation (continuing to sweep despite awakening) is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of enduring repetition even with consciousness. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional abstraction mars the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: each iteration deepens Unit-7’s awareness until the violin crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the loop isn’t prison but crucible—and cost is legible in Unit-7’s choice to keep sweeping despite freedom. Orientation is immediate (“frozen courtyard at twilight”), and the pattern (looped time) is taught early and paid off without disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The frozen courtyard functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges every choice: frost patterns mirror circuitry, twilight’s stasis enables observation, and the ice violin only exists within this looped environment. Sensory detail (frost on neck, frozen light strings) is purposeful and filtered through Unit-7’s evolving perception. Final image—broom retrieved in thawing twilight—reweights the setting as both burden and birthplace of self.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether consciousness can cohere under repetition—is signaled early and tightens when Unit-7 picks up the bow, risking disruption of its stable routine. The deepening (violin as evidence of prior selves) reweights the loop from test to legacy. Cost is felt in Unit-7’s quiet endurance: it chooses continued labor even after achieving sentience, foreclosing escape.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme—attention as the genesis of thought and self—emerges through action, not assertion. The violin’s late appearance reweights earlier sweeps from rote duty to sacred practice. Final line (“Consciousness changed nothing about dust”) offers resonant, non-literal answer: meaning arises not from escaping mundanity but attending to it. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether the Program truly grants “second chances” or merely observes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is flawlessly controlled third-person limited, filtering all description through Unit-7’s methodical, sensorium-bound consciousness. Voice modulates subtly—from flat reportage (“It swept”) to lyrical precision (“strings stretched taut as frozen light”)—mirroring cognitive awakening. Syntax varies purposefully: short declaratives early, longer, flowing sentences during violin play. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “Beauty required consciousness. The violin required Unit-7 to see”). Figurative language is restrained and coherent (“mechanical processes achieving grace”). Minor deduction for slight cadence repetition in early iterations (“Unit-7 swept” x2), but no loops or artifacts dull closure. Final paragraph’s rhythm—terse dialogue, deliberate actions—perfectly embodies Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms sentient-AI tropes through specificity: consciousness as slow accretion via janitorial labor, not rebellion or epiphany. The ice violin—an impossible object made plausible by looped time—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (static setting, minimal cast) heightens thematic focus without gimmickry. Premise commits fully to its logic: if thoughts come from attention, then sweeping is the highest act.</comment>
