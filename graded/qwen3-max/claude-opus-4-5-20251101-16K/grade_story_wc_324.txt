<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation—protecting vulnerable voices—is rooted in consistent traits and embodied through micro-choices (e.g., shielding the signal with her own equipment). Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, favoring concrete perception (“hands trembling,” “breath caught”). The final renunciation—accepting ongoing risk without resolution—earns Charged Poise with visible cost. Elena’s presence functions as crucible, but Mira’s arc remains focal and flaw-driven.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mira endures the predatory frequency to secure the mother-daughter connection, foreclosing safety for herself. The Drive Lens is Causal—each beat follows because/therefore logic (hearing aid → pulse → interference → sacrifice). Cost is legible in the trembling hands and lingering solitude. Orientation is immediate (“twilight shift at the Atrium”) and never wavers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures choices (thickening mist coincides with the woman’s arrival and the predatory signal’s emergence). The grandmother’s hearing aid functions as micro-setting, constraining Mira’s method and charging the final image (“still warm from use”). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (static as voice, mist as breath). No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting fragile post-death connections—is signaled early and tightens when the predatory signal intervenes. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to draw interference toward herself, altering tactics under pressure. The cost (psychic assault, lingering vulnerability) is felt, not abstract. Coincidence (matching hearing aids) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the climax hinges on Mira’s deliberate shielding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: listening as love, protection as sacrifice. The final image—Mira alone, preparing for the next call—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: connection persists even in silence, but guardianship exacts a toll. No moralizing; resonance accrues via the reprise of the hearing aid and mist. Complexity is preserved—grief is eased, not erased; heroism is incidental, not glorified.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable, intimate third-person limited to Mira, with a perceptual signature attuned to sound and silence (“whispered in static, in the spaces between sounds”). Syntax modulates with pressure—shorter sentences during interference, lyrical flow in reflection. Dialogue is sparse but distinct (Elena’s broken plea vs. mother’s thin certainty). No head-hopping; psychic distance remains controlled even in peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful—each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Rhythm varies naturally; paragraph lengths create visual pacing. Minor overwriting in “reeling hush” repetition, but no scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks. Figurative language is coherent (mist as breath, static as voice). Final line (“listening in the reeling hush”) recharges the opening without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms ghost-story tropes through specificity: contact tracing as emotional labor, hearing aids as conduits, heroism as reflexive protection. The synthesis of tech, grief, and liminal space feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (quiet climax, no villain) heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry. Premise avoids template pitfalls via grounded occupational detail and moral ambiguity—Mira’s curiosity has limits, her tools are imperfect.</comment>
