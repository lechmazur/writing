<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her grief, longing, and professional identity fuse in tactile details (breath crystallizing, oil scent) without diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (trusting frost patterns, uncap vial unconsciously) reveal a hierarchy of values: repair over completion, process over product. The final act of assembly earns her renunciation of paternal dependency through prior causality. No safety-hedging; her flaw is impatience with incompleteness, which the library corrects.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Vera accepts that some locks open only through time, not tools—a Charged Poise crystallized in the ticking mechanism. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost patterns, reflections, and gear-fitting intensify into a cadence shift (“Click, pause, click”) that reweights repair as rhythm. Cost is legible in the father’s unfinished clock now completed by her hands—love outlasting its speaker. Orientation anchors instantly (“frozen library above the clouds,” “Vera climbed”).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The frozen library functions as micro-setting: ice mirrors constrain choice by revealing ghostly lessons, while frost patterns guide navigation. Brass gears and oil vial are tactile extensions of setting, their coldness and scent charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects crisis (crystallizing breath, sharp oil) then calm (soft hush, distant morning). Environment directly enables the closure—without ice mirrors, Vera couldn’t see her father’s guidance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning repair’s rhythm—is signaled early and deepens when mirrors reveal grief’s propagation through mechanisms. Vera’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to work despite trembling, uncaps oil unconsciously, fits the final gear. Cost is felt in the father’s absence made present through labor. One meaningful tightening suffices: the realization that forcing pieces together fails; understanding shared rhythm succeeds.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: broken gears mirror interrupted lessons, ice mirrors show wholeness in fragmentation. The non-literal answer—repair requires growing into the healer—is resonant without moralizing. Final image reweights “incomplete lessons” as capacity for self-completion. Avoids sentimentality via mechanical specificity (escapement wheels, pine-resin oil) grounding emotional truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Vera notices frost’s warmth-guided patterns, oil’s lightning-metallic scent, gear textures. Rhythmic control under pressure varies sentence length (“Click, pause, click” vs. lyrical descriptions). POV modesty maintained—she infers prophecy’s truth but doesn’t over-explain library mechanics. No head-hopping; compression in backstory (father’s death) is anchored to present vial/oilcloth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density: “spires of ice-glazed stone catching... rays” establishes setting, light, and fragility in one phrase. Minor overwriting in “grief worn like a veil” (slight abstraction), but peak beats avoid figurative muddle. Sentence openings vary (“She pulled,” “In her reflection,” “Under the soft hush”). No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis: lunar-eclipse locksmith + frozen library + clockmaker’s grief transforms tropes through specificity (oil recipe, escapement mechanics). Risk-taking heightens stakes—the hall of mirrors isn’t metaphor but functional tool. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight: only ice’s purity could reflect temporal ghosts. Avoids middle-ground hedging; commits fully to repair-as-rhythm concept.</comment>
