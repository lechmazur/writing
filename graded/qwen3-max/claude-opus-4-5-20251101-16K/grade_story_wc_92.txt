<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete and consistent: her “calmly inventive” nature manifests in tactile choices (adjusting the gnomon, using the quill holder) rather than exposition. Her motivation—freeing thinkers to spark revolution—is rooted in personal history and reinforced by the Cradle of Sparks’ parable. The final lie to the warden (“Only darkness and time”) embodies her duality: obedient sentinel vs. revolutionary, with visible cost in the empty quill holder and reset sundial. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied through action under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the fort’s “thousand golden lights” now symbolize obliviousness, not vigilance, reweighting the entire premise. The causal chain is tight—blackout enables escape, timed by sabotage, executed via coded sundial, concealed by Mira’s role. Cost is legible in the emptied quill and the reset sundial, both charged with future risk. Orientation is immediate (“luminous fort,” “Mira at her post”), and the inferred Causal lens holds throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The luminous fort isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint and resource. Lanterns enable surveillance; their absence creates opportunity. The half-painted sundial functions as micro-setting: its coded angles directly enable the escape. Final image—sundial catching “last dying ember”—charges closure by contrasting artificial light with natural twilight, symbolizing the revolution’s quiet emergence. Every detail (oil lines, cliff stairs, arrow slit) serves tactics or theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing seventeen prisoners before engineers restore light—is signaled early and tightened by the 20-minute clock. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she initiates the signal, unlocks cells, and lies to the warden. Cost is felt in the emptied quill (loss of names = future risk) and reset sundial (erasure of evidence). Pressure coheres under Causal lens: blackout → sabotage → escape → cover-up, each step narrowing options with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: fire born from “friction of ideas” mirrors Mira’s methodical unlocking. The final image—fort blazing “oblivious” while revolution spreads via freed minds—offers a non-literal answer: true power lies in uncontainable ideas, not walls or lamps. Avoids moralizing; resonance accrues through the quill holder’s emptiness and sundial’s reset, implying cyclical struggle. Complexity is preserved—the fort remains, but seeds are planted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices tactical details (stone walls, oil lines, bronze reflections) filtered through her role as lock sentinel. Rhythm modulates with pressure—shorter sentences during escape (“Cell by cell… silent as smoke”), lyrical cadence in reflection (“winking hush”). No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained (she doesn’t know engineers’ actions, only infers). Voice remains consistent even in elevated moments (“gentle friction of ideas”) because it’s character-anchored.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density: “fingers trailing along the stone wall until they found the alcove” conveys setting, action, and purpose in one phrase. Figurative language is purposeful (“emerged silent as smoke”) without muddle. Minor scaffold in “intrigue had been building for months” slightly flattens momentum, but compression is strategic. Final line’s cadence (“no one… even knew to look”) resonates without overwriting. No loops or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms prison-break trope through specificity: revolution via intellectual liberation, not violence; tools are sundial and quill, not weapons. The “Cradle of Sparks” concept feels fresh yet inevitable, grounded in Mira’s childhood trait and the fort’s mechanics. Risk-taking (silent escape, coded artifact) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final image—oblivious fort under golden lights—subverts expectation of triumphant rebellion, offering quieter, more resonant victory.</comment>
