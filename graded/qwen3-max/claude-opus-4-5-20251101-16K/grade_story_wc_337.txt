<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her tremor, fractured reflection, and lucid unrest reveal a self shaped by trauma without therapy-speak. Her micro-choices (e.g., lifting the needle despite trembling) align with her motivation to mend what others cannot face. Sela’s silent witnessing deepens through specific gestures (staring at the net, hesitant exit), avoiding stock grief tropes. The final renunciation—accepting eternal mending—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mira endures her unrest while freeing others, crystallized in her still hands post-unraveling and immediate return to work. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the net’s knots accumulate silence, and their release reweights the sanctuary’s hush with conceptual cost (generational grief transmuted). Orientation anchors cleanly by line 30; the prism sanctuary, starlight, and net establish who/where/when without disorientation debt. Final image (“accumulating silence, until the stars gave way to dawn”) makes cost undeniable: peace for others, perpetual labor for her.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: its breathing walls absorb released silences, enabling Mira’s work. Starlight fracturing into “silent colors” charges the final image, where transformed grief becomes ambient light. Tactile details (bone-colored net fibers, steel needle glowing like dawn) are filtered through Mira’s professional attention, avoiding tourist cataloging. Spatial choreography remains coherent—bench, cushion, entrance—and the environment evolves causally as knots loosen and prisms pulse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing ancestral silences to grant rest—is signaled early and tightens through Mira’s unraveling, which forecloses the option of passive mourning. Agency drives escalation: each knot Mira frees alters the sanctuary’s atmosphere and Sela’s understanding, culminating in the net’s transformation. Cost is unmistakable: Mira’s eternal vigil (“lucid unrest”) versus the peace granted to others. The deepening—from fisherman’s regret to grandmother’s shame—narrows options to one method (unraveling) under persistent constraint (her tremor).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the net’s knots: silence as accumulated presence, not absence, and inheritance as invisible haunting. Subtext operates through gesture (Sela’s hollow eyes mirroring Mira’s past) and charged objects (the net holding unsaid words). The ending offers a non-literal answer—peace requires exhuming buried truths—without moralizing, reweighting the opening premise (“broken” masks as faces of the dead). Resonance arises from particulars: the fisherman’s storm, grandmother’s shame, Mira’s fire, all woven into the sanctuary’s hush.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled single third-person limited, with perceptual signature evident in Mira’s noticing (prisms “breathe,” net fibers “want to hold secrets”). Voice modulates under pressure: lyrical density during unraveling (“cold whisper brushed past her cheek”) gives way to stark simplicity at closure (“There were always more knots”). Dialogue is sparse but distinct—Sela’s fragmented questions contrast Mira’s declarative wisdom—and indirection carries subtext (“They’re asking to be exhumed”). No head-hopping; psychic distance remains consistent even in reflective moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (e.g., “fibers turned bone-color” implies age and death). Rhythm varies purposefully: long, fluid sentences during knot-unraveling contrast short declarations at climax (“Yes.”). Zero loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (silence as sediment, net as trap/cloth). Minor deduction for slightly elevated diction (“interlaced hush”) in peak beats, though voice-motivated. Final line’s cadence (“accumulating silence, until the stars gave way to dawn”) perfectly resolves opening motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise transforms mask restoration into metaphysical mending of ancestral silence, avoiding trope through specific mechanics (knots = unsaid words, prisms = grief transmuters). Emotional truth grounds ingenuity: Mira’s tremor and Sela’s inherited insomnia feel lived-in, not conceptual. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure, abstract stakes) heightens meaning without gimmickry—the net’s unraveling is both literal and symbolic. Synthesis feels inevitable: fire → brokenness → sanctuary → eternal mending, with no retreat from its haunting logic.</comment>
