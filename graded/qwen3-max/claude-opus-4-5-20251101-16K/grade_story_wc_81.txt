<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her logical temperament contrasts with embodied awe during the blackout, creating credible contradiction without diagnostic self-awareness. Her micro-choices (noticing page thickness, using the stamp) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over safety. The final act of writing is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost—potential death beneath the ocean—with no safety-hedging. Her flaw (rigid orderliness) transforms into moral resolve, not erased but repurposed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira’s decision to write reconfigures archival labor from passive indexing to active testimony, with oceanic pressure and bioluminescent stillness crystallizing stakes. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density increases via sensory shift, pattern break in perception, and cadence slowing into resolve. Cost is legible in “if she did not survive… leave her own trail,” and the antique stamp’s reappearance ties mechanics to meaning. Orientation anchors immediately (“seventeen years,” “sunken city”), and causality holds without gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sunken library functions as micro-setting: dome pressure, algae glow, and desalination pumps directly shape tactics (silence enables perception; darkness reveals layered pages). Bioluminescence isn’t decorative—it alters how Mira sees, enabling discovery. The stamp and pages are tactile extensions of setting, handled with purpose. Final image of algae “indifferent to human tragedy” charges closure by contrasting natural cycles with human betrayal, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus institutional erasure—is signaled early and deepens when blackout removes machinery’s “heartbeat,” forcing Mira to rely on senses. Her agency drives escalation: noticing page thickness, testing the stamp, cross-referencing. Cost is unmistakable: survival vs. documentation, with “ocean pressing down” literalizing consequence. The tightening forecloses complacency; she can no longer index passively. Coincidence (blackout) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the stamp’s purpose is uncovered through her methodical action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: archival labor as both complicity and resistance. The bioluminescent algae—a natural archive—contrasts human falsification, offering non-literal answer: truth persists beyond institutions. No moralizing; resonance arises from Mira’s quiet act of stamping a fresh page, repricing “indexing” as ethical witness. Ambiguity lingers (will she survive?), but conceptual cost—betrayal buried for centuries—is undeniable. Subtext lives in dappled light, layered pages, and the circle-within-triangle seal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Mira’s professional bias (“logical page indexer”) and evolving perception. Voice modulates under pressure: early sentences are methodical; blackout section breathes with lyrical rhythm (“dappled and shifting like sunlight through leaves”); final lines tighten into resolve. Perceptual signature is distinct—she notices textual inconsistencies, paper thickness, mechanical rhythms. No head-hopping; diction stays within her lexicon (“administrative records,” “layered lie”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “darkness so complete it seemed to have physical mass” merges image and sensation efficiently. Sentence variety supports rhythm—short clauses during blackout, flowing syntax in reflection. One minor artifact: “tranquilly perceptive” slightly edges toward label-speak, but it’s immediately grounded in action (“noticed… pages felt thicker”). No loops or scaffolding; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final paragraph’s cadence (“Somewhere above… Somewhere below…”) echoes opening dome/ocean imagery without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms archival tropes through specificity: Valdren’s betrayal isn’t generic—it’s sealed in layered manuscripts marked by a geometric stamp. The blackout isn’t just crisis—it’s sensory recalibration enabling truth recovery. Risk-taking (lyric stillness amid disaster) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight: only an indexer would notice paper thickness; only algae glow could reveal hidden text. Authentic vision coheres voice, setting, and moral calculus—no middle-ground hedging.</comment>
