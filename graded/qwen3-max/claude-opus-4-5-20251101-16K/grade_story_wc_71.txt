<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is exquisitely concrete—her noticing is embodied in micro-choices (carrying the orris root, placing it deliberately) and rooted in lifelong traits. Her emotional state (“emptier every year”) manifests through precise sensory perception, not therapy-speak. The final whisper “I see you” emerges organically from her history of attention, not epiphany. Her flaw—hyper-observance bordering on isolation—is consistent and costly, yet enables the story’s resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds tightly: each displaced object deepens the pattern until the hush-shard crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—houses feel alive because they are witnessed—and cost is legible in Maren’s loneliness and the decades-long wait. Orientation anchors instantly (“Maren… returned to the quiet bay”), and the single scene builds with lyrical inevitability. The circuit closing between noticer and space delivers earned, resonant stasis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting functions as active crucible: the bay’s creeping rise mirrors Maren’s noticing; spring’s soft light enables the streetlights’ “daydream”; the attic window frames both harbor and hush-shard. Every sensory detail (salt air, dust motes, violet scent) filters through Maren’s perceptual bias and charges the final image. The orris root and teacup gain meaning only within this specific micro-setting. Environment directly constrains the climax—only here can silence crystallize.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding why houses feel alive—intensifies through Maren’s agency: she enters, observes, interprets displacements, climbs, touches, offers. The tightening occurs when she recognizes displacement as sanctification, foreclosing passive observation for active participation. Cost is felt in her solitude (“emptier every year”) and made visible in the final offering. Pressure accumulates texturally but coherently under the lens, culminating in a charged poise where noticing becomes ritual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through particulars: displaced objects, aging orris root, millimeter tides. The central question (“why some houses feel alive”) receives a non-literal answer—aliveness arises from accumulated, witnessed silence—and reweights all prior images. No moralizing; profundity arises from Maren’s whispered “I see you,” not authorial intrusion. The hushed blaze tone embodies the theme: tenderness as sacred attention, not doctrine.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is masterfully singular: syntax mimics Maren’s noticing (long, layered sentences that accumulate detail like dust motes). Perceptual signature is consistent—she sees time in inches, dialects in vowels, silence in absences. Prose modulates under pressure: shorter phrases at the hush-shard climax (“She touched it and heard nothing so loudly that her ears rang”). No head-hopping, no register drift; even elevated diction (“sanctify,” “resonant reconfiguration”) feels native to her perfumer-grandmother lineage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“streetlights were daydreaming,” “dust motes hung suspended like questions”). Figurative language is coherent (silence as shard, scent as dormant love) and peaks without muddle. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary organically. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors the bay’s eternal indifference versus the house’s completed circuit—craft serving concept flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise transforms the haunted house trope into a meditation on witnessed absence, grounded in Maren’s specific profession (perfumer), locale (fishing bay), and trait (creeping normality noticer). The “hush-shard” concept feels inevitable in hindsight, arising from granular details (softened vowels, millimeter tides). Risk-taking—lyric accumulation over plot—heightens stakes by making silence tactile. No derivative echoes; every element synthesizes into a singular vision of love as patient attention.</comment>
