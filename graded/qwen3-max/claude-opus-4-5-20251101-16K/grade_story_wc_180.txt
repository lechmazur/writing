<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—pride, regret, and professional rigor collide in embodied choices (e.g., trembling fingers, refusal to look up). Sera’s feistiness masks vulnerability, and their dynamic crystallizes around the ribbon reveal. The granddaughter’s presence forces Mira to confront generational rupture without melodrama. Final choice—to teach—is earned through prior causality and charged with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira’s vow renewal via the ribbon reconfigures her stance toward legacy, craft, and family. The “deciduous” metaphor crystallizes this—cyclical return, not permanent loss. Cost is legible: decades of estrangement, reputational ruin, and pride surrendered. Causal lens holds: every beat flows from betrayal → isolation → revelation → pedagogical recommitment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard setting actively constrains and enables: fruit trees provide perch and privacy; broken rafters frame precarious work; baptismal font repurposed as root source mirrors spiritual-professional rebirth. Tools (silver wire, quartz lenses) are handled with tactile specificity. Final image—blossoms falling like snow amid mending—charges closure with cyclical hope. Environment isn’t backdrop but co-agent in the story’s logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving craft integrity against institutional theft—tightens when Sera reveals Calla’s hidden archive, forcing Mira to choose between bitterness and transmission. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her initial dismissal gives way to instruction only after proof of lineage and stolen legacy surfaces. Cost is felt: reopening wounds of betrayal and maternal failure. Pressure remains coherent under causal lens, narrowing to one decisive act—teaching anew.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from quartz-mending, ribbons, and orchard decay: wisdom requires both continuity and surrender. “Deciduous vows” reframe permanence as cyclical fidelity, not unbroken oaths. Final image—Mira adjusting Sera’s grip while leaves fall—offers non-literal answer: healing occurs through imperfect, intergenerational relay. No moralizing; resonance accrues through concrete particulars (ribbon, journals, wire) rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Mira’s sensory and professional priorities (e.g., noticing lens fractures before faces). Voice modulates with emotional intensity: terse during work, lyrical at revelation. Dialogue distinguishes generations—Sera’s irreverent directness vs. Mira’s weary authority—without convergence. Syntax compresses under stress (“Again.”), then expands into reflection, all while maintaining perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “fruit trees climbing through shattered stained glass”). Figurative language is purposeful (“reputation like ash,” “blossoms like snow”) and never muddled. Minor deduction for slight overuse of em-dashes in middle section, but no loops, scaffolds, or register drift. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors thematic return—measured, deliberate, blooming.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of guild politics, optical craft, and arboreal sanctuary feels fresh yet inevitable. “Quartz-eye mending” transforms familiar tropes of artisanal exile into something specific and tactile. Emotional truth anchors ingenuity: pride’s cost, apology’s difficulty, craft as love language. Risk-taking (abandoned cathedral as orchard-workshop) heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure would collapse without this precise fusion.</comment>
