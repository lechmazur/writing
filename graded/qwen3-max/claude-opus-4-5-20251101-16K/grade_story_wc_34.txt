<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied contradiction—her yearning to speak versus her lifelong silence—and crystallizes in micro-choices like scratching songs into stone. Her emotional arc is earned through decades of accumulation, not epiphany, and the final act (encoding “You are heard”) emerges organically from her history. The young caretaker functions as a mirror rather than a full character, avoiding overextension while intensifying Mira’s motivation. No diagnostic label-speak; feelings manifest through tactile, sensory detail (“caught in her throat like thorns”).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with closure achieved via Conceptual Repricing: the courtyard itself becomes a voice, reweighting silence as legible expression. Cost is felt in Mira’s spectral existence—“ghost in code”—and the forty years of unacknowledged labor. Orientation is immediate (“misty courtyard suspended above the clouds”), and the pattern (lightning-thunder intervals as narrative beats) is taught early and pays off at closure. The final image—stone singing in “a language older than sound”—makes the before/after legible without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The misty courtyard isn’t backdrop but active constraint: its floating stones absorb Mira’s encoded songs, and the eastern wall becomes her canvas. The flower press bolt plate—a micro-setting object—shapes tactics (scratching vs. singing) and charges the final image when the caretaker traces the spiral. Sensory detail is purposeful (“wet stone surfaces,” “ink-stained fingers”) and filtered through Mira’s perception. Weather (lightning/thunder) and altitude (“below the clouds”) aren’t decorative but temporal and thematic scaffolds.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—articulating the inarticulable—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s decision to encode rather than speak. The tightening occurs when she targets the new caretaker, narrowing her audience from “nobody” to one specific witness. Cost is visible: Mira’s entire post-life existence is bound to stone and symbol, foreclosing direct connection. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens—each scratch adds pressure until the final message crystallizes meaning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the irreducible link between silence and expression: voice need not be auditory to be real. The ending offers a non-literal answer—“the courtyard itself was singing”—that reweights every prior image (lichen as language, humming as balladry). No moralizing; resonance accrues through concrete particulars (bolt plate, spiral, fountain pause). Subtext thrives in absence: what Mira never said aloud gains power through its material residue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is singular, lyrical, and rhythmically precise, modulating with emotional intensity (“driftingly alert” during calm, staccato urgency near thunder). POV remains tightly bound to Mira’s spectral perception—no head-hopping, no omniscience beyond her stone-bound awareness. Syntax mirrors theme: long, flowing sentences for memory; fragmented clauses for lightning strikes. Diction (“thunderheads that rolled below… like slow gray whales”) is idiosyncratic yet controlled, never slipping into abstraction or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is consistent (watercolor consciousness, whale-like clouds) and never muddled. Sentence openings vary (“In life…”, “She drifted…”, “The lightning flashed…”), and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional cadence. Minor deduction for one slight redundancy (“driftingly alert” appears twice), but no loops, scaffold, or artifacts obscure causality or dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Originality lies in fusing digital-age metaphor (“ghost in code”) with ancient monastic silence, transforming both into a tactile poetics of stone and weather. The core premise—that graffiti can be song, silence can be heard—is fresh yet feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (non-corporeal protagonist, accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Every detail (flower press bolt plate, ink-stained fingers) feels irreplaceable, cohering into a singular artistic vision.</comment>
