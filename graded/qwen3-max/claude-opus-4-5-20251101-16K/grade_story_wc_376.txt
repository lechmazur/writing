<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation—rooted in embodied grief and truth-sensitivity—is consistent, specific, and intensifies under pressure. Her internal conflict (fear of loss vs. need for truth) manifests physically (“wilt near dishonesty”) and drives every key choice. The final renunciation isn’t tidy; she accepts wilting as necessary cost, then renews her purpose. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through gold-veined physiology and tactile action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira’s stance crystallizes—truth is worth seeking even when it hurts—and the cost (wilting in lies) is visible and embraced. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of fragmented truths coalesces into a map, culminating in the Repository’s revelation. Orientation is clear by line 3; causality is motivated by artifact discovery and emotional logic. Final image reweights the entire premise: silence is temporary, not loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting functions as micro-setting: the toxic sky, amber domes, and dried oasis aren’t backdrop but active constraints shaping scarcity, isolation, and the value of candor. Mira’s body *is* setting—gold-veined leaves respond to truth like barometers. The Conversation Hall’s decay mirrors societal collapse, and its hidden door charges the climax. Final image ties environment (toxic sky) to purpose (shimmering leaves), satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering lost truth—is signaled early and deepens when Mira finds the Repository. The tightening occurs at the door: honesty becomes literal key, forcing vulnerability as tactical requirement. Cost is felt: she must voice fear to enter, and later wilts publicly among liars. Agency drives escalation—her choices (searching, speaking, mapping) narrow options and raise emotional stakes without coincidence resolving tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: truth as biological imperative, silence as preservation, not erasure. Subtext thrives in gesture (leaves unfurling) and object (shredded map reassembled). The ending offers a non-literal answer: unfinished conversations aren’t failures but archived acts of courage. No moralizing; resonance arises from the mother’s recorded voice and Mira’s decision to guide others—wisdom earned through specific loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is single, intimate, and consistent—every perception filtered through Mira’s truth-sensitive physiology. Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that breathes during reflection and tightens in crisis (“gold-veined tendrils... contracting like ferns retreating from frost”). No head-hopping; diction stays within her calligrapher’s lexicon. Elision (e.g., skipping the journey to the Hall) is purposeful and paid off by closure’s emotional weight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense, varied, and propulsive—each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language is coherent (botanical metaphors align with Mira’s nature) and never muddled. Zero paraphrase loops; syntax shifts with emotional intensity (short clauses at climax: “I am afraid I’ll find nothing”). Final line (“lost words waited for someone honest enough to hear them”) recharges the opening lie with earned resonance—no scaffold, no overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis: truth as ecological force, archives as emotional ecosystems. Tropes (dying world, hidden knowledge) are transformed through specificity—gilded skin, zinc postal plates, crystalline sound containers. The core concept feels inevitable in hindsight: candor preserved not despite fragility but because of it. Bold risk (lyric accumulation over plot) heightens stakes without gimmickry; vision is singular and cohesive.</comment>
