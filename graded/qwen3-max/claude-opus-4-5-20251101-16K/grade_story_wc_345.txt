<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is grounded in specific, embodied responses—her grief, doubt, and resolve feel earned through micro-choices like digging under the tree and ringing the bell. The ghost’s motivation is revealed with emotional precision, though her lack of on-page conflict limits full complexity. Mira’s final act crystallizes her arc without overstatement, balancing communal duty and personal loss. No diagnostic label-speak or tidy epiphanies mar the psychological realism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story operates under a Causal lens: each chalk message directly triggers a consequential action, culminating in the fleet’s launch. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the ghost’s release and the fleet’s departure reconfigure hope as collective labor. Cost is legible: abandoning Veridian-7, the orchards, and the ghost’s tether. The Nebula’s reality is confirmed through archival discovery, not coincidence, preserving causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The floating arches and amber skies are not backdrop but active constraints—the failing arches force evacuation, and the orchard setting shapes every decision. The butterfly bell functions as micro-setting, its tactile presence charging the climax. Sensory detail (chalk on cobblestones, green brass) is filtered through Mira’s urgency, avoiding tourist cataloging. The final image of butterflies in nebular light ties environment to theme without over-explanation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—survival through unity—is signaled early and tightens when the community fractures. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she unearths the bell, rallies the settlers, and initiates repairs. The cost is felt: leaving cultivated land, accepting shared vulnerability. Coincidence never resolves; the ghost’s guidance is consistent, and the Nebula’s existence is verified through effort, not luck.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the ghost’s orchestration and the bell’s reuse: care as infrastructure, hope as cultivated, not found. The final image—butterflies in nebular light—reweights “brambled hope” without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (the ghost’s farewell shimmer) and objects (the bell’s repurposing). No thesis statement; insight arises from Mira’s choice to trust collective memory over panic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, with perceptual signature evident in Mira’s agrarian lexicon (“saplings,” “pruning”) and tactile focus. Prose modulates rhythm—longer sentences for reflection, short clauses during crisis—without syntactic monotony. No head-hopping; even the ghost’s backstory is filtered through Mira’s discovery. Voice remains consistent, avoiding register drift even in high-stakes moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: “floating rock arches drifted through amber skies like the bones of forgotten giants” establishes tone and stakes in one stroke. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Minor figurative density in the opening (“bones of forgotten giants”) is paid off by the arches’ literal collapse. Final line’s “butterflies” resonates without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms the “helpful ghost” trope through specificity: the botanist’s legacy is tied to horticultural pragmatism, not sentiment. The Nebula of Respite gains freshness via archival rediscovery and collective navigation. Risk-taking in structure (mosaic-like time jumps implied through seasons) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The synthesis of orchard logic and cosmic survival feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
