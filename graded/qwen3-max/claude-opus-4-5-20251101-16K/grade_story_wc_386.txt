<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete and character-particular—her method of “weaving truth carefully” manifests in micro-choices (e.g., withholding full exposure of Henrik Moss) that reveal her hierarchy of values. Elsa’s spectral hunger and vulnerability feel individuated, not archetypal. The final renunciation—carving innocence into ice instead of confronting the living—earns its cost through consistent motivation: salvaging purity from wreckage, not justice. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied in candlelight, ice, and warped glass.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through layered dream evidence, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing—Elsa’s innocence is inscribed not in human memory but glacial time. Orientation is immediate (“shrine carved into the glacier’s heart”), and the closure image (Mira carving) reconfigures the entire premise with conceptual cost: truth survives only where humans cannot erase it. The crack in the ice and flaring candles mark a decisive intensification tied to emotional revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The glacier shrine isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains choice (only ghosts summoned by retrieved objects appear here) and charges the final image (carving into ice as permanent testimony). The melted snow globe functions as micro-setting: its warped glass refracts light like “borrowed starlight,” mirroring Mira’s salvaged truths. Sensory detail is selective and urgent (blue ice, candle flames steady “despite physics”), filtered through Mira’s wreck-diver pragmatism and ghost-whisperer reverence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring a child’s stolen innocence—is signaled early and deepens when Mira chooses archival permanence over futile human confrontation. The tightening occurs when Elsa asks, “Will you expose him?” forcing Mira to renounce public vindication, accepting that glaciers remember longer than people. Cost is legible: Mira forgoes justice to preserve purity, crystallizing her stance in action (“I’ll carve your innocence”). Pressure coheres under Accumulative logic—dream data accumulates until truth demands reconfiguration, not resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the snow globe’s transformation: from toy to artifact to vessel of reclaimed truth. The final image—carving into ancient ice—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: how do we honor the falsely accused? Not through human courts, but through enduring witness. Subtext thrives in silence (Elsa’s smile dissolving into ice) and gesture (Mira’s hands holding warped glass). No moralizing; resonance accrues through specific particulars—porcelain figures fused, candlelight in niches, a cook’s guilt in strangers’ dreams.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose carries a distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices what a diver would (corrosion, salvageability) and what a ghost whisperer must (flickering edges, dream intrusions). Syntax modulates with pressure—short, stark clauses during Elsa’s revelation (“You did not start the fire”) contrast with lyrical density in setting description. Voice remains consistent even in lyric mode; no head-hopping or register drift. Dialogue is sparse but potent, each line pursuing goals (Elsa seeks exoneration, Mira offers calibrated truth).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is taut and evocative: “candles burning in hollowed niches, their flames steady despite physics—borrowed light” establishes tone and stakes in one breath. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is controlled (“children are easy to blame… calcification of guilt onto the vulnerable dead”) and pays off in the glacier’s memory. Final paragraph’s rhythm—“Mira began to carve”—resolves with quiet propulsion, no overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The fusion of wreck-diving and ghost-whispering feels inevitable yet fresh, grounded in occupational logic (objects carry spirits) and emotional necessity (salvaging purity). The “windows of connection” via dream cameos transforms a supernatural trope into a forensic method with real limitations. Risk-taking—eschewing human justice for glacial inscription—heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Every element (snow globe, ice shrine, dream analysis) synthesizes into a singular vision of posthumous dignity.</comment>
