<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation—grief-driven dream preservation—is rooted in consistent, specific traits (craftiness as both skill and subversion) and intensifies through embodied micro-choices: clumsy crane-folding, trembling hands lighting the wick. Her internal conflict (beauty/anguish inseparability) acts simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The final ascent is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in aching knees and surrendered grams of grief. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through tactile ritual, not therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mira endures luminous torment rather than seek peace, foreclosing emotional resolution with clear cost (“she would not trade it for all the peace in any world”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density increases via gem-polishing, crane-folding, and ascent—culminating in a Charged Poise where options (surrender vs. continuation) are legible. Detachment hour functions as a taught temporal pattern that tightens pressure without causal breaks. Cost is undeniable in the final image: Lia lives only in torment, and Mira chooses it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The glass basilica, tea garden, and floating isle are not backdrop but active constraints: the basilica’s archives house dreams, the garden’s cold stone aches Mira’s knees, and ascent/descent physics shape her emotional trajectory. The lantern and gems function as micro-setting, directly enabling dream projection. Final image charges the environment: cranes circle spires, shadow detaches, extinct sun’s warmth lingers—all reweighting the space as a vessel of grief. Sensory detail (weeping light, silver-leafed plants) is filtered through Mira’s craft-focused perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving Lia’s dreaming self—tightens meaningfully at detachment hour, when access to archives becomes possible. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she polishes gems, folds cranes, ascends despite physical/emotional cost. The deepening (“construct a complete child from memory and light”) raises stakes without coincidence. Cost is unmistakable: each crane carries “a gram of grief she could almost bear to surrender,” and the priest’s complicity implies shared, unhealed loss. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with no off-stage resolutions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: grief as luminous torment that must be folded, polished, carried—not resolved. The final image offers a non-literal answer to “Can love outlive death?”: yes, but only through perpetual, costly labor. No moralizing; resonance accrues via recurring images (cranes, gems, shadow) that shift from tools to carriers of meaning. The priest’s silent complicity deepens thematic complexity without false equivalence—some losses demand illegal, sacred theft.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices angles of light, facets of sapphires, paper grain—details of a craftsperson. Rhythmic control modulates with pressure: short clauses during polishing (“buffing each facet”), lyrical flow in dream projection. POV remains tightly controlled; no head-hopping, no omniscience beyond Mira’s knowledge. Elision is purposeful (Lia’s drowning summarized early) and paid off in closure’s emotional weight. Voice is singular, consistent, and inseparable from character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density: every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or stakes (“fingers thick and stupid” conveys grief’s physicality). Figurative language is coherent (“light that seemed to weep”) and never muddled. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; syntax varies purposefully. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “luminous torment” repetition, but it serves thematic resonance rather than redundancy. Final line (“ascending that mattered more than gravity could ever comprehend”) earns its lyricism through accumulated specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-recording, origami grief, and inverted physics (“descending while ascending”) feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (floating islands, memory archives) are transformed through Mira’s craft-centric lens. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates: grief is measured in grams, dreams in sapphire facets. Bold risk-taking (lyric structure, conceptual physics) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The premise commits fully to its logic—no retreat into sentimentality or easy resolution.</comment>
