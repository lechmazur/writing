<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her insomnia, grief, and artistic vocation intertwine without diagnostic abstraction. Her micro-choices (writing lullabies instead of sleeping, pinning the final poem) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: she trades rest for resonance. The contradiction between longing to surrender and refusing to drown in grief operates simultaneously throughout. Her endurance becomes Earned Stasis: she forecloses personal peace to sustain collective healing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “I came home after all… to what we might yet become” reweights the entire premise from exile to co-creation, with the cost legible in her eternal wakefulness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds through lyrical density, not causality—and the final image crystallizes stakes without false resolution. Orientation anchors instantly (“gargantuan shell,” “insomniac poet,” “centuries ago”), and the pattern of spiraling echoes pays off in the child’s sleep above.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges every choice—it shapes acoustics, isolates Mira, and filters light, directly enabling her method and defining her solitude. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: bioluminescent gardens, translucent walls, off-key wind—all filtered through Mira’s poetic perception. The postcard and shell together charge the final image, proving environment and object are inseparable from theme. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent across centuries.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming grief into generative peace—is signaled early and deepens via Mira’s unwavering method. Escalation occurs through accumulation: her voice drifts farther, survivors respond, treaties emerge from exhaustion steeped in her lullabies. The cost is unmistakable: she never sleeps, never returns “home” in the old sense, yet finds fulfillment in becoming the dream itself. Agency lies in attention and endurance, not action, fitting the Accumulative lens perfectly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Mira’s practice: pain metabolized becomes medicine, loss composted becomes soil. The ending offers a non-literal answer—home isn’t a place but a shared becoming—reweighting Andromeda from destination to metaphor. No moralizing; resonance arises through concrete images (postcard curling, coral-like peace). Subtext lives in fragments heard by survivors, avoiding sentimentality while affirming stubborn beauty as resistance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is singular, lyrical, and consistent—prose rhythm mirrors oceanic spirals, with syntactic variety that breathes during reflection and tightens in climax. Perceptual signature is strong: Mira notices decay that blooms, sound that transforms, light that works to reach depth. No head-hopping; single POV remains anchored in her sensory world. Elision is purposeful (compressed time, mosaic shards of survivor reactions), taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense with layered imagery (“photosynthesize pain into beauty,” “reef-shadow joy”) but avoids purple overload—each metaphor serves character or theme. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“turned her sleeplessness into stanzas… hope”) borders on paraphrase but is redeemed by cadence. Final paragraph achieves propulsion through varied sentence lengths and concrete verbs (“pinned,” “began,” “traveling”). No loops or scaffold; information density remains high without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms the “artist in exile” trope through deep-sea specificity, temporal scale, and acoustic ecology. The “blossom armistice” is not a gimmick but an earned social shift rooted in persistent, quiet artistry. Originality lies in framing peace as coral—slow, polyp-by-polyp accretion—rather than grand treaty. Risk-taking (lyric structure, centuries-spanning scope) heightens thematic stakes without obscuring emotional truth.</comment>
