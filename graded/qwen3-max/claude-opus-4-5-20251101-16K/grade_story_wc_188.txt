<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete, embodied, and consistent—her grief, competence, and doubt coexist without tidy resolution. Her micro-choices (e.g., using Sava’s rag to light the fuse) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final act of building “the next rocket” enacts Earned Stasis: she renounces despair not through epiphany but through repeated, costly action. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through ritual, craft, and sensory detail.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira’s decision to “make light anyway” crystallizes options under Accumulative/Textural drive, with felt cost in every spark against starless dark. The mosaic note functions as both inciting incident and thematic keystone, and the kerosene rag’s use completes an arc seeded early. Orientation is clear by line 30; lens (Accumulative) is taught via chanting and sensory layering, held through climax. Cost is legible in the “gravity of hopelessness” defied through labor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The blooming fortress isn’t backdrop—it pressures choice: wisteria and roses reclaim war, modeling transformation Mira must enact. The fountain’s mosaic basin directly supplies the story’s turning point. Crucially, the kerosene rag (micro-setting) constrains the final act—only Sava’s tool can ignite the fuse, charging the closure. Sensory detail (jasmine, papery roses, condensation rhythm) is filtered through Mira’s trade and grief, never touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defying hopelessness through creation—is signaled early and tightens when the mosaic reveals “Make light anyway,” forcing Mira to choose between surrender and ritual. The deepening occurs not through external opposition but internal pressure: the absence of stars, the weight of memory. Agency is clear—she builds, chants, strikes matches—and each rocket forecloses passivity. Cost is felt in the relentless labor “until dawn,” though escalation lacks a second tactical shift beyond the initial decision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: fireworks as defiance, decay as fertile ground, silence as weight. The final image—flowers catching sparks like “witnesses”—offers a non-literal answer to despair: beauty persists not despite darkness but through stubborn reiteration. No moralizing; subtext lives in the rag’s scent, the mosaic’s hidden words, the chant’s shift from formula to prayer. Complexity is honored—Sava’s death isn’t redeemed, only answered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is flawlessly controlled single-third, with a perceptual signature rooted in pyrotechnic lexicon (“strontium for red”) and grief-filtered attention. Voice modulates rhythmically: chanting cadence, match-strike brevity, lyrical expansion at climax. Syntax mirrors emotional state—fragmented during focus, flowing in revelation. No head-hopping, no register drift; even elevated phrases (“stubborn, beautiful refusal”) feel earned by character and context.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense, vivid, and varied—sentences breathe or accelerate with purpose. Figurative language is precise (“wisteria cascaded… like purple waterfalls”) and never muddled. One minor slip: “fire spinner's kerosene rag knot” slightly overloads modifiers, but it’s character-idiomatic. No loops, scaffolds, or filter-verb stacks; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final paragraph’s cadence (“She struck another match and smiled…”) lands with perfect propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms familiar tropes (grief, legacy, ruins) through specific, irreplaceable details: chemical chants, mosaic-as-message, kerosene-rag ignition. The synthesis of pyrotechnics, botany, and mourning feels fresh yet inevitable. Risk-taking—lyric structure, minimal dialogue, ambient awareness as method—heightens stakes without gimmickry. No derivative echoes; voice and vision cohere into a singular artistic stance that avoids safety or sentimentality.</comment>
