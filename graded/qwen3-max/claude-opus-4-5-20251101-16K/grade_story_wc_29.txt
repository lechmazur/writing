<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied tension (“hands trembled,” “stomach drop”) and micro-choices (modifying equipment, increasing amplitude). Her motivation—rooted in mentorship, observed patterns, and ethical urgency—is consistent and intensifies under pressure. The flaw lies in slight diagnostic clarity (“cautiously hopeful” as label rather than fully dramatized contradiction), though her final defiance feels earned. No secondary characters on-page, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Structure is taut: single scene, clear orientation by line 3, causal escalation from observation to interference to cosmic reply. Closure is Charged Poise—Mira reconfigures the game by talking back, with visible cost (departmental fracture, personal risk) and conceptual repricing (humanity now has agency). The drive lens is Causal, held throughout, and the eleven-minute window tightens stakes effectively. Final image crystallizes new terms of engagement without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The basement radio station functions as a charged micro-setting: its modified broadcast array enables Mira’s tactic, and the fluttering charts at climax tie environment to action. Sensory detail is selective (hiss of stars, subsonic pulse) and filtered through professional attention. The setting constrains choice (hidden transmitter, secrecy) and charges the final image (charts trembling like witnesses). No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—exposing manipulation to prevent catastrophic miscommunication—is signaled early and escalates via Mira’s risky broadcast. The convergence window creates a live clock that narrows options; her choice to interfere forecloses passive listening and risks professional ruin. Cost is felt (isolation, potential backlash) and shapes the ending’s poise. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Causal lens, though the cosmic reply slightly softens consequence by introducing amused reciprocity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: communication as power, truth as contested terrain, and agency as refusal to be played. Subtext operates through signal patterns, institutional fracture, and Okonkwo’s ghost. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—“to outwit tricksters, you must talk back”—without moralizing. Recurring charts and signals reweight meaning, and the final stance embraces complexity: hope tempered by wariness, not victory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, with perceptual signature shaped by Mira’s expertise (noticing signal seams, subsonic thresholds). Voice modulates rhythmically—from tense observation to grim resolve—and syntax compresses under pressure (“She increased the subsonic frequency’s amplitude”). No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon. The cosmic message’s phrasing (“CLEVER LITTLE SIGNAL READER”) contrasts effectively without breaking POV modesty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lean and propulsive, with high information density (“cosmic tricksters,” “subsonic pulse rippled outward”). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with tension. Minor overwriting in “elegant patterns dissolving into chaos” leans slightly purple, but no loops or scaffold. Final lines avoid summary, landing on concrete image (“one interpreter refused to look away”). No artifacts obscure causality or dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise transforms first-contact tropes by centering epistemic warfare and signal interpretation as combat. The “cosmic tricksters” concept is fresh, grounded in technical specificity (subsonic interference, convergence windows), and morally complex. Risk-taking—making humanity’s first move one of sabotage, not greeting—heightens stakes without gimmickry. The synthesis of radio drama, astrophysics, and psychological tension feels inevitable in hindsight and irreplaceable.</comment>
