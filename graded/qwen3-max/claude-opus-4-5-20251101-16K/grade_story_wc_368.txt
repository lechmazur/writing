<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Yuki’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through her dye-master perception—color, light, structure—and her emotional contradictions feel lived-in, not diagnostic. Her micro-choices (studying the wing, lifting it into the light) reveal a hierarchy of values: understanding over closure, motion over fixation. The heart’s “recognition without memory” embodies embodied emotion without therapy-speak. Final renunciation of fixing color in favor of shifting hues is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of accepting impermanence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: beauty and story are not fixed but refracted through fragile, borrowed structures. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through layered images (mist, wing, light trails) until the morpho wing’s projection reweights everything. Cost is legible in Yuki’s realization that she must carry stories forward without owning them. Anchors (who, where, when) are clear by line 3; no orientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house isn’t backdrop—it’s a crucible that defies gravity just as the heart defies death, and its crystal floor enables the climax. The morpho wing functions as micro-setting, constraining the final choice: only its structural color can map Kenji’s unrealized dreams. Sensory detail is filtered through Yuki’s professional attention (“structural, not pigment”), and mist acts as both atmosphere and metaphor for memory’s permeability. Final image recharges the setting by tying stone, light, and heart into one resonant system.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding why stories magnetize to certain people—is signaled early and deepens when Yuki realizes she now carries that magnetism. The tightening occurs when she lifts the wing: a choice that narrows options from passive observation to active illumination. Cost is felt in the loss of permanence (“some things were not meant to be fixed”) and the burden of carrying another’s unlived life. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the pressure could be more viscerally immediate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of craft, grief, and borrowed time—no moralizing. The morpho wing’s “iridescent caution” becomes a metaphor for how beauty and vulnerability attract and repel simultaneously, mirrored in Yuki’s new role as story-bearer. The ending offers a non-literal answer: truth isn’t captured but revealed through refraction, through the shape of what we carry. Subtext thrives in silence (Kenji’s untold story) and gesture (the old woman’s knowing pour).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled first-person with a perceptual signature rooted in dye mastery—light, structure, transience. Voice modulates rhythmically: shorter sentences during ladder climb, lyrical flow during revelation. Dialogue is sparse but distinct—the old woman’s aphoristic speech contrasts Yuki’s internal precision. No head-hopping; psychic distance remains intimate yet restrained, avoiding over-explanation. The prose trusts the reader to infer meaning from concrete particulars, not assertions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light as memory, color as truth) and pays off in the climactic projection. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “rivers, streams, tributaries of radiance”—a rare moment of stacked modifiers—but it serves the Accumulative lens. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm varies naturally, and the final paragraph’s cadence crystallizes the thematic turn without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms the transplant narrative by fusing craft, physics, and myth: the donor’s legacy isn’t memory but structural potential, like iridescence. The floating tea house, morpho wing, and sun-trail method form a cohesive, non-obvious system that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over plot) heightens stakes by making understanding dependent on fragility and light. No template echoes; specificity (dye master, structural color) grounds the wonder in tangible expertise.</comment>
