<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vela’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—she believes the beings mean no harm yet endures physical pain from their presence. Her micro-choices (placing the stone, singing specific tones) reveal a hierarchy of values: coexistence over expulsion. The final act of charting new ripple marks shows credible endurance with visible cost—peace requires constant tending. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied in vibration, breath, and fracture lines.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Vela forgoes permanent silence for fragile, active harmony, with clear cost (“the bloom would need tending”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story deepens through sensory density and pattern shifts, not causality. Orientation anchors instantly (“Vela pressed her palms against the stone wall”), and the final image reconfigures the caves’ function without breaking internal rules. Cost is legible in “hammered repose”—peace beaten into shape through labor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The harmonic caves are not backdrop but active constraint: their resonance amplifies both agony and healing. The echo chamber stone, ice fractures, and thermal shifts directly shape tactics. Sensory detail is purposeful—vibrations “thrashed like trapped lightning,” breath clouds on ice—and filtered through Vela’s professional perception. The setting charges the final image: caves that “remembered how to breathe” only because Vela read their wounds.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—coexistence without erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Vela chooses not to banish the refugees. The tightening occurs at the Deep Resonance: chaotic ice patterns force precise, high-stakes placement of the stone. Agency drives escalation—her song weaves frequencies, transforming scream into chord. Cost is felt in the labor of maintenance (“tomorrow she would conjure another bloom”) and the irreversible loss of primordial silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: “quiet in the storm” isn’t absence but collaborative rhythm. The final line—“learning to storm together”—reweights the entire premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture (nodding to beings) and object (stone absorbing then transforming sound). Ambiguity lingers: peace is temporary, but its practice is dignified. No platitudes; wisdom arises from reading cracks and singing into wounds.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled—first-person limited to Vela’s sensory and professional lexicon (“ripple-mark mapkeeper,” “fracture lines”). Voice modulates under pressure: shorter sentences during ice examination, lyrical flow during the bloom’s expansion. Perceptual signature is distinct—she notices acoustic topography others miss. No head-hopping; even beings’ emotions are interpreted through light flickers, not omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “vibrations... thrashed like trapped lightning” does character, setting, and conflict work. Sentence openings vary (“Vela pressed,” “She carried,” “At the Deep Resonance”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors cohere (sound as storm, peace as bloom). Final line crystallizes theme without overwriting—“learning to storm together” earns its resonance through prior texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise transforms ecological grief into acoustic diplomacy—refugees aren’t invaders but unwitting disruptors. Originality lies in method: reading ice cracks as sound maps, conjuring “bloom of hush” via resonant physics. Risk-taking (lyric structure, abstract beings) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The synthesis feels inevitable: grandmother’s teachings + refugee crisis = hammered repose. No template echoes; every detail serves the core question of shared survival.</comment>
