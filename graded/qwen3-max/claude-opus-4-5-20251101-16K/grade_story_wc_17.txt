<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation—driven by inherited obsession and sensory gift—is consistent and embodied, not merely stated. Her final choice to stay is earned through micro-decisions (kneeling, pressing palms, whispering) that reveal her hierarchy of values: legacy over safety. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest through tactile perception (“vibrations no one else could sense,” “ivy tightened around her ankle”). The flaw—compulsive listening—directly enables her entrapment, fulfilling the Earned Stasis closure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira’s realization crystallizes the stakes—walls dream of wholeness and will not release her—and she accepts entrapment as inevitable. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through layered sensory details, diary fragments, and the film negative, culminating in the ivy’s sentient grasp. Cost is legible in the final image: “They would not let her go.” Orientation is clear by line 30; causality flows from discovery to consequence without gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting functions as active antagonist: the ivy-veiled passage, ruined atrium, and fireplace aren’t backdrop but agents that constrain and consume. Moss, ferns, and ash ground the post-climate-shift world, while the stone’s vibrations and ivy’s movement directly shape Mira’s choices. The recurring object—the stone wall—charges the final image when it “speaks” through vibration and memory. Sensory detail is selective (tactile cold, visual charred pages, auditory groan) and filtered through Mira’s profession.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering what walls dream—is signaled early and deepens into survival. The meaningful tightening occurs when Mira reads the diaries: knowledge shifts from curiosity to terror, yet she persists. Agency drives escalation: her choice to whisper “What do you dream about?” triggers the climax. Cost is unmistakable: physical entrapment (“ivy tightened around her ankle”) and psychological surrender (“She understood now why her grandmother had tried to end this work”).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: architecture as mournful archive, legacy as inescapable burden. The central question—“What do walls dream about?”—is answered non-literally through Mira’s flooded vision of “endless corridors folding into themselves.” Final image reweights prior material: the ivy’s letter-like shapes and the walls’ patience transform from eerie detail to existential trap. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether communion is transcendence or consumption.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled first-person limited, with perceptual signature rooted in acoustic sensitivity (“heard conversations from rooms she’d never entered”). Voice modulates under pressure: prose shortens and intensifies at climax (“The building groaned… She should have run”). Syntax reflects Mira’s cartographer precision (“hand-drawn frequency maps”) and emotional restraint. No head-hopping; diction stays within her lexicon—technical yet lyrical—without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: sentences vary rhythmically (long descriptive clauses vs. stark fragments like “The building groaned”). High information density—each line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor artifact: “legacy’s burden hung heavy” slightly borders on label, but immediately grounded by concrete inheritance (“listening equipment, hand-drawn frequency maps”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language (“nature’s slow revenge”) coheres with ecological theme.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise—acoustic archaeology of mourning architecture—is freshly synthesized from familiar tropes (haunted buildings, climate collapse). Specificity elevates it: “corridor echo cartographer” as profession, walls dreaming of lost human sounds. Risk-taking (sentient ivy, stone as consciousness) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable: the grandmother’s warning, the negative’s imagery, and Mira’s gift all converge causally. No derivative echoes; vision is singular and committed.</comment>
