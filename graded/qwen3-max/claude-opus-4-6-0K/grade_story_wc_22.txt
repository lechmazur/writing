<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Harmon’s motivation—rooted in ancestral loss and linguistic faith—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies through micro-choices: collecting pods, translating bird calls, whispering dead languages while planting. His internal contradiction (grief vs. generative hope) acts simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final kneeling among sprouts is a renunciation of futility, earned by prior causality, with visible cost: decades of solitude, failed attempts, a dead reef. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in salt-stunted vines and dirt-black hands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is Earned Stasis: Harmon endures, carrying life from jetty to battlefield, foreclosing despair with visible cost (the reef stays dead, the sea keeps coming). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through recurring images (seed pods, bird calls, dead tongues) that reweight the stake. Cost is legible in the final image: “one dead language, one bird call, one seed pod at a time.” Orientation is clear by line 2; no disorientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The blooming jetty functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—it supplies seaweed paste, fungi, algae—and charges the final image with its “impossible garden.” Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: violet sea lavender, rotting planks, calcium-locked hardpan. Environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism (e.g., battlefield’s refusal to grow echoes Harmon’s grief). The reef’s death isn’t just backdrop—it tightens tactics by forcing reliance on the jetty’s narrow corridor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming the battlefield through submerged concords—is signaled early and deepens via Harmon’s agency: he doesn’t wait for miracles but decodes bird calls to gather nutrients. The tightening occurs when he shifts from failed compost to jetty-derived remedies, narrowing options to a single fragile method. Cost is unmistakable: time, isolation, the unchanging threat of the sea. Luck complicates (birds guide him) but doesn’t resolve—he must act, carry, plant, speak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: renewal requires forgotten pacts, not force. The final image—sprouts growing while Harmon speaks a 4,000-year-dead language—offers a non-literal answer: persistence in ritual, not victory, reclaims what war took. No moralizing; resonance arises from particulars (pods labeled in extinct scripts, terns leading to nitrogen). Subtext lives in silence—the sprouts don’t answer, but they grow—embracing ambiguity without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Harmon notices linguistic patterns in bird calls, sees soil as remembering violence, hears dead languages as natural speech. Rhythmic control under pressure—short sentences for action (“He carried buckets”), lyrical cadence for reflection (“Narrow vastness”). No head-hopping; stable third-person limited. Elision is purposeful (thirty years compressed into one sentence) and paid off in closure’s accumulation. Voice modulates with emotional intensity without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. High information density: “Salt-stunted vines threaded through the pilings” conveys ecology, decay, and resilience in six words. Figurative language is coherent—“light was the color of bruised fruit” ties to emotional tone without muddle. Final line’s cadence (“one dead language, one bird call, one seed pod at a time”) recharges the motif with rhythmic inevitability.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ecological restoration via extinct linguistics and ornithological translation feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (barren battlefield, dying coast) are transformed through specific, grounded choices—Sumerian hymns matching whimbrel calls, Proto-Sinaitic whispered over primrose. Bold risk: making dead languages functional, not decorative. No derivative template; authenticity of vision coheres in every detail. +0.4 for risk heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
