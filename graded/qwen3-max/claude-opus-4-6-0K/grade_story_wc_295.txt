<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her insomnia as credential, her grief-infused precision—and Gregor’s restrained sorrow feels earned. Their micro-choices (handling the telegram, writing Seda’s name) reveal hierarchies of value with visible cost. Motivation flows from consistent traits: Elara decodes not for fame but witness; Gregor seeks validation for his grandmother’s truth. The final beat crystallizes their shared burden without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the temple glyphs are revealed as stellar notation, reweighting ancient observation as scientific language. Cost is legible in Gregor’s grief and Elara’s decade of sleeplessness—both reframed as necessary witness. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through aligned notebooks, star charts, and dream transcripts until the pattern breaks open. Orientation is immediate and maintained; the lens holds coherently to the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The observatory functions as micro-setting: its quiet, mechanical hum, and rotating dome shape Elara’s work rhythm and emotional state. The daylily-pressed telegram—a tactile artifact—constrains interpretation by linking floral veins to dream glyphs. Final image charges setting: Mira’s pulse outside mirrors the observatory’s newfound intimacy. Sensory detail is selective, professional, and emotionally calibrated—no white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decoding the shared unconscious—is signaled early and tightens when Seda’s telegram arrives, narrowing options to collaboration or isolation. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she aligns notebooks with star charts, speaks the decoded line aloud. Cost is unmistakable: years of lost sleep, Seda’s institutionalization, Gregor’s childhood grief—all reconfigured as necessary burdens. Coincidence (the telegram’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from Elara’s witnessing choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: “shared burdens” isn’t stated until the decoded glyph, then resonates backward through Elara’s vocation and Seda’s fate. The final image—Mira pulsing while two humans finally listen—offers a non-literal answer: meaning persists in rhythm, not revelation. Avoids moralizing; wisdom arises from concrete particulars (daylily veins, stroke order, tracking motors). Subtext lives in silence, gesture, and the act of naming Seda co-author.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Elara notices architectural dissolution in dreams, astronomers’ absorbed solitude, the amber translucence of pressed petals. Prose modulates under pressure—longer sentences for discovery, shorter for realization (“She was right”). No head-hopping; Gregor’s POV is externalized through action and dialogue only. Voice remains lucid-dream precise yet poetic, never slipping into academic register even at peak insight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density: every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language is purposeful (“copper dome greened by decades,” “sky before sunrise”) without muddle. Zero loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are sharp. Final line recharges Mira’s pulse as heartbeat—rhythm mirrors theme. Minor deduction for one slightly elevated phrase (“technology of shared burdens”), but it’s character-bound and paid off.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synthesizes lucid dreaming, stellar cartography, and undeciphered glyphs into a fresh epistemology: ancient astronomy as linguistic record. Risk-taking (dream logic as data) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight—Seda’s “madness” retroactively validated by Elara’s method. Specificity anchors universals: Oaxacan farmers, Cornish miners, daylily-pressed paper make the shared unconscious tangible, not abstract.</comment>
