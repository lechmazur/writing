<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marguerite’s motivation—to discover the shape of intentions—is rooted in consistent traits (precision as respect for the dead) and intensifies through micro-choices like nightly decoding. Her interiority is concrete (“fingers trembled,” “cold seep through her wool coat”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The final decision to take the tapestry to the archivist is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost: exposing buried injustice. Contradictory impulses—lightness vs. grief, solitude vs. duty—act simultaneously without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the revelation that Celia was silenced reframes Harrowfield’s history with undeniable social cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density increases via decoded border threads until the northeastern corner delivers the pivotal sentence. Cost is legible in Marguerite’s trembling hands and the sovereign case as reliquary. Orientation anchors firmly by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt silo under stars functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: its open roof frames both celestial indifference and Marguerite’s humming, making loss tangible. Sensory detail is selective (cold metal, pale starlight, frayed threads) and filtered through her gardener’s attention. The sovereign case and tapestry constrain choices—they are handled, used, and reweighted. Environment actively shapes tactics: starlight enables decoding, curved walls echo burial mounds.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering Celia’s testimony—is signaled early and tightens when the northeastern corner yields its sentence, foreclosing silence as an option. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: each night’s untangling deepens knowledge and narrows moral paths. Cost is unmistakable: bearing witness means inheriting Celia’s burden. Under the Accumulative lens, this single decisive intensification suffices; no false resolutions or coincidences undercut it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: precision as respect, grief as weather, testimony as textile. The ending offers a non-literal answer—the hum rising through cobalt dark reweights loss as fertile ground—without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence (nameless headstone), gesture (tender organization), and image (stars as indifferent witnesses). No prompt-like thesis; ambiguity lingers (will justice come?) without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Marguerite notices thread colors as letters, roses over children’s plots, cold as an “old friend.” Rhythmic control modulates with pressure—longer sentences for reflection, clipped phrases at climax (“She set down the tweezers”). Voice remains consistent first-person with stable psychic distance; no head-hopping. Elision (backstory via sovereign case) is taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density (“velveteen gloom,” “uncharted echoes”) without overwriting; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Syntax varies purposefully—fragments for tension, flowing clauses for memory. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; figurative language coheres (tapestry as ledger, stars as witnesses). Final line resonates by recharging the opening hum with new weight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cemetery gardener as truth-seeker via textile cryptography feels inevitable yet unexpected. Tropes (vanished grandmother, hidden ledger) are transformed through specific choices—sovereigns as evidence, chess clock as ritual boundary. Bold risk: accumulative structure without dialogue succeeds because pressure builds through tactile decoding. Vision coheres—voice, setting, and theme fuse into singular artistic stance.</comment>
