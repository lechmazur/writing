<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s posthumous agency is compellingly rendered through the colony’s collective response, but her characterization relies on reported virtue rather than dramatized contradiction. Pascal and Tuva show micro-choices (e.g., Pascal’s tearful acceptance, Tuva’s bell-ringing), yet their interiority remains lightly sketched. The altruistic ghost trope risks sentimentality, but the cost—grief, thorn-scratched hope—is embodied in actions like moving seedlings pre-dawn. Final endurance (“still reaching through the thorns”) earns stasis without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: “WELL DONE” crystallizes communal achievement with visible cost (Maren’s absence, arch collapses averted). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—messages accrue into blueprints, tightening pressure via patterned dawn chalkings. Orientation is immediate (“lavender sky,” “crash-landed three years prior”), and causality is maintained through consequence (moved seedlings → arch collapse avoided). Cost is legible in Tuva’s “brambled hope” and Pascal’s weeping—emotional price paid for trust in the unseen.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The orchard planet isn’t backdrop but active crucible: sideways trees, floating arches, and gravity-as-suggestion directly constrain survival tactics (e.g., children mapping arch stability). The copper bell—a micro-setting—charges the closure when rung to summon pollinators, its vibration essential to orchard fertility. Lavender sky and nectar-dripping clouds establish tone while enabling plot (pollinators need light-pulse habitat). Every detail serves pressure or payoff; no white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—communal survival through trust in Maren’s guidance—tightens meaningfully when messages shift from warnings to blueprints, forcing collective reorganization. Agency emerges through compliance: Pascal redirects irrigation, Tuva tends the garden, children chart arches. Cost is felt in grief (“scratches were real”) and labor, culminating in the harvest’s earned reward. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from adherence to Maren’s instructions under persistent constraint (unstable arches, root rot).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme—altruism as enduring infrastructure—emerges through action, not assertion. The butterfly garden and chalked roles weave individual effort into communal organism, rejecting tidy binaries (life/death, leader/follower). Final image (“WELL DONE”) reweights Maren’s death from loss to ongoing stewardship, resonating without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence: Pascal’s daughter’s forgiveness, the unspoken cost of trusting a ghost—all particulars avoid abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person plural POV (“they,” “the settlers”) functions as single-POV collective consciousness, perceptually consistent in its focus on shared labor and grief. Voice modulates rhythmically: short clauses for urgency (“They moved the seedlings”), lyrical cadence for reflection (“dripping nectar into the clouds below”). Diction stays grounded (“stitches through torn cloth,” “brambled hope”), avoiding register drift. No head-hopping; even Pascal’s crack-voiced line filters through communal memory.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: “gravity here was a suggestion, not a law” establishes world and tone in one stroke. Figurative language is controlled (“roots threading stone like stitches”) and never muddles causality. Minor scaffold in “shared hunger and shared grief forge bonds” slightly abstracts, but momentum carries through concrete verbs (“sutured,” “chalked,” “rang”). Final paragraph’s spiral butterflies and lavender sky achieve propulsion without overwriting—closure image sharp, unsentimental.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms ghost-story tropes through specificity: Maren’s chalked altruism isn’t spectral whim but logistical genius tied to planetary ecology (pollinators need bell vibrations). The “nebula of respite” premise avoids cliché by grounding hope in labor (“brambled”) and cost (arch collapses, rationed water). Risk-taking—collective POV, non-corporeal protagonist—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision feels singular: grief as cultivation, leadership as posthumous choreography.</comment>
