<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren’s reticence is embodied, not declared—her micro-choices (cleaning the lamp, pocketing sea glass, building cairns) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in quiet tenderness. Her internal contradiction—disbelief in ghosts yet belief in the lantern room—fuels credible action without therapy-speak. The final act of maintenance and reply is earned by prior observation and emotional calibration. No safety-hedging; her flaw (emotional reserve) enables her unique capacity to stay.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Maren chooses to remain, foreclosing isolation with visible cost—ongoing vigilance, emotional labor, silence ashore. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through stone sequences and sensory density, culminating in a cadence shift when the lamp reignites. Cost is legible in the “warm” sea glass against her ribs and the unspoken burden of continuity. Orientation is immediate and never wavers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The lantern room functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges every choice: its fractured lens, cold iron floor, and impossible shadows directly shape Maren’s actions and perception. The sea glass, oil, and cairns are tactile extensions of place. Sensory detail is filtered through Maren’s professional familiarity and emotional attunement—she notices gulls avoiding the western face, trembling hands, anomalous reflections. The final image recharges the setting as a vessel of shared prayer.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving safety through light—is signaled early and deepens when the lamp dies. Maren’s agency drives escalation: she motors out alone, interprets the cairns, cleans the mechanism. The meaningful tightening occurs when she reads the stone letters and understands the haunting as protective longing, which reweights her motive from duty to communion. Cost is felt in her silent commitment and the warmth of the sea glass—a small, persistent burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the cairn language and the lamp’s restoration: communication beyond words, stewardship as love, the sacredness of ordinary vigilance. The ending offers a non-literal answer to “how do we remember?”—not through speech but through action, recurrence, and presence. Subtext thrives in silence and stone; no moralizing. The final prayer (“let the light hold”) resonates because it’s lived, not stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Maren notices suffering to “insert tenderness,” observes with maritime precision, and interprets silence as data. Syntax modulates with pressure—longer, lyrical sentences for reflection; shorter, concrete ones during action. Voice remains consistent, interiority grounded in physical sensation (“pressure behind her sternum”). No head-hopping; single POV executed with rhythmic control and emotional restraint.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purpose: “light seen through water,” “color of a held breath,” “luminescent ache” avoid purple excess by anchoring metaphor in character perception. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. No loops or scaffold—each line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor deduction only for one slightly ornate phrase (“humming grief that was almost beautiful”), but it serves thematic resonance without muddling clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms the haunted lighthouse trope through specificity: the ghost isn’t vengeful but protective, communication via cairns replaces spectral screams, and resolution is maintenance, not exorcism. The synthesis of maritime tradition, grief, and silent dialogue feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over plot) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Vision is singular—quiet, luminous, anchored in coastal realism.</comment>
