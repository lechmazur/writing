<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The summoner’s interiority is concrete, embodied, and consistent: her “terrible gift” of summoning meaning manifests through tactile ritual (folding paper, listening to water) rather than exposition. Her final renunciation—choosing silence over prophecy—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: stiff knees, solitude, the erased creases in the crane’s wing. Contradictory impulses (desire to prevent war vs. burden of knowledge) act simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through perception (“moonlight pooled like molten silver”) and micro-choices (folding guided by negative space).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the protagonist endures, foreclosing the prophecy’s path with palpable cost—the blank paper, the valley’s reassembled quiet. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout: pressure builds via sensory density (water-notation, owl calls, sedge grass) until the counter-resonance collapses the prophecy. Cost is legible in the final image: “the silence she had mapped would hold… for as long as someone was willing to listen harder than the world was willing to speak.” Orientation is clear by line 2; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The nocturnal brook functions as both setting and micro-setting: it supplies the “living notation” that enables the summoning method and constrains the ritual (paper must touch flowing water). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—sound dominates, reflecting the protagonist’s attunement to silence. The crane’s wing, moonlight, and sedge grass are filtered through her perceptual bias, never cataloged. The final image recharges the opening: the brook now carries only “water-words,” proving the environment has been irrevocably altered by her act.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silencing a war-spawning prophecy—is signaled early and tightens through one decisive deepening: the prophecy’s resistance in owl calls and wind forces the summoner to press the wing to the water, risking failure. Agency is exercised through attention and folding, not combat; the cost is stamina, solitude, and the erasure of her own interpretive labor (the blank paper). Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under Accumulative pressure, and the price (“listen harder than the world was willing to speak”) charges the final image with moral weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the tension between meaning-making and necessary silence, voiced through the crane’s wing (wholeness vs. honest incompleteness) and the “smoothed hush” that dissolves coded doom. The ending offers a non-literal answer to the central question—can one unmake meaning?—by showing silence as active refusal, not absence. No moralizing; resonance accrues through the restored paper and the valley’s preference for quiet. Subtext operates in gesture (folding), silence, and the terrestrially cosmic hymn that links mud to galaxies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>POV is single, stable, and deeply focalized: every image is filtered through the summoner’s synesthetic perception (“moonlight pooled like molten silver,” water as “living notation”). Voice modulates with intensity—syntax shortens during resistance (“The owl fell quiet. The wind stilled.”)—yet maintains rhythmic control. Diction is precise and character-bound (“negative space her ears carved from the night”), avoiding register drift. The prose embodies the mind of a listener: clauses breathe like rests in music, and the final line crystallizes the perceptual signature without head-hopping or exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“She summoned with attention… leaning into the silence between water-sounds the way a musician leans into rests”). Figurative language is coherent and pattern-taught (“molten silver,” “tranquil blaze,” “invisible corridors”) without muddle. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; paragraph lengths vary purposefully to mirror ritual pacing. The closing cadence (“found that it preferred the quiet”) resolves with image, not assertion, and the read-aloud rhythm remains fluid even at peak intensity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality lies in reframing prophecy as acoustic contagion and silence as active counter-resonance—a fresh synthesis of mythic and sonic logic. The solitary summoner trope is transformed by grounding her power in listening, not commanding, and her tool (a single origami wing) rejects wholeness as truth. Risk-taking (lyric structure, abstract stakes) heightens thematic coherence without gimmickry. Every element feels inevitable in hindsight: the “terrestrially cosmic” hymn justifies the scale, and the “smoothed hush” redefines victory as erasure, not triumph.</comment>
