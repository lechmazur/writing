<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation—longing to be heard—is embodied in her tactile decoding of the ghost’s messages and crystallizes in her climactic choice to sing. Her internal contradiction (desire for connection vs. habitual silence) manifests physically through micro-choices: clutching the bolt plate, pressing her palm to the wall, humming on descent. The final renunciation isn’t of singing but of solitude; she carries a shared language back into the world, with visible cost in the form of enduring vulnerability. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through action and sensory detail.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lira and the ghost achieve mutual understanding, transforming desperate encoding into shared language. Cost is legible—the ghost’s “silence that felt full” replaces years of unmet longing; Lira bears the weight of ongoing return. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases via layered symbols (hex heart, static hand), culminating in plain luminous imagery. Orientation anchors by line 30; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The courtyard functions as active micro-setting: its shifting murals constrain Lira’s decoding tactics, and the lightning-thunder interval dictates when messages glow brightest. The flower press bolt plate—a tool-as-setting—charges the final image when it goes smooth after receiving the message. Sensory detail is selective (slick flagstones, warm metal, silent lightning) and filtered through Lira’s urgency. Weather and altitude directly shape action and emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—articulating unspoken needs—is signaled early and tightens when new symbols bloom during the lightning pause. Lira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to lift the bolt plate, then to sing, converting passive reception into active translation. Cost is unmistakable: the ghost’s decades of encoded loneliness are finally answered, and Lira assumes ongoing responsibility (“She would return”). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via pattern intensification, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of voice and code: broken things make music, walls hold souls, silence can be full. The ending offers a non-literal answer—the shared language held “like a lantern holds its flame”—that reweights all prior encoding as plea rather than art. No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete particulars (hexadecimal heart, warm bolt plate). Complexity is embraced: connection requires both speaker and listener, neither sufficient alone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Lira notices what matters to a balladeer (sound intervals, tactile warmth, visual shifts in pigment). Voice modulates under pressure—syntax shortens during lightning flash, expands during song. Diction remains character-bound (“tinkersong wonder,” “driftingly alert”) without register drift. No head-hopping; interiority is shown through embodied choices, not exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“flagstones slick with condensation that never quite became rain” establishes setting, mood, and liminality). Rhythm varies purposefully: long lyrical sentences for description, staccato phrases for action (“She lifted… held… closed”). Minor overwriting in “cathedral organ played by wind” slightly muddles the sonic metaphor, but doesn’t obscure closure. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes folklore (balladeer), tech (ghost in code), and lyricism into something fresh yet inevitable. Tropes are transformed: graffiti isn’t vandalism but encoded longing; the “ghost” is neither spirit nor AI but consciousness poured into art. Risk-taking (silent protagonist who sings only as conduit) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity abounds—alpine flower press, hexadecimal heart—avoiding generic “artist meets machine” templates.</comment>
