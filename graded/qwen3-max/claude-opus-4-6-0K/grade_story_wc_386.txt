<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is precise, embodied, and conflicted—her ghost-whispering inheritance isn’t mysticism but a disciplined method rooted in grief and rigor. Her micro-choices (handling the snow globe, interpreting dreams) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over safety, precision over spectacle. The final decision to expose the sabotage carefully, not impulsively, earns her endurance as Charged Poise. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion manifests through tactile perception (fingers on warped glass, candlelight refracting through ice).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Maren reweights “truth” from spectral murmur to evidentiary architecture, with cost legible in her solitary walk carrying “forty-three whispered names.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—dream cameos accrue into a case—and the shrine setting functions as amplifier, not deus ex machina. Orientation anchors instantly (“The shrine breathed”), and the melted snow globe’s heat anomaly seeds causality that pays off in dream interpretations. Final image crystallizes stakes without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The glacier shrine isn’t backdrop but active constraint: ice refracts light like memory, candles lean as if listening, cold shapes Maren’s breath and focus. The snow globe—a micro-setting—charges every key beat and the final image, its warped dome mirroring distorted truth. Sensory detail is selective (blue-white ice, fused plastic smell implied), filtered through Maren’s wreck-diver pragmatism. Environment directly enables the climax: Sami belief in ice as antenna justifies her ritual without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—salvaging pure truth from corrupted wreckage—tightens when dream evidence contradicts the official report, forcing Maren to choose between reckless exposure or meticulous proof-building. Her agency drives escalation: analyzing journals, then seeking the shrine, then interpreting layered dreams. Cost is felt in isolation (“long walk out of the glacier”) and emotional burden (“borrowed starlight in her chest”). Coincidence complicates (random dreamers), never resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through object and action: truth isn’t unearthed but woven from fragile, refracted signals. The snow globe’s smear of paint becomes a metaphor for obscured data, later redeemed through disciplined reconstruction. Final image offers non-literal answer—truth as something carried, not declared—with resonance in “forty-three whispered names.” No moralizing; ambiguity lingers (who sabotaged? will she succeed?), but ethical weight is undeniable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is singular: lyrical yet precise, blending scientific rigor (“contamination data”) with poetic intuition (“palms on opposite sides of glass”). Syntax modulates under pressure—longer sentences for reflection, clipped phrases for revelation (“The dreams came.”). Perceptual signature is consistent: Maren notices tools, distortions, thermal anomalies. No head-hopping; even dream sequences are filtered through her interpretive lens. Prose-as-character: rhythm mirrors diving—slow descent, sudden clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “candle flames leaned toward the walls, drawn by some invisible exhalation” does atmosphere, causality, and character in one. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances plot, theme, or texture. Figurative language is coherent (light = knowledge, ice = memory medium) and never muddled in peak beats. Final paragraph’s cadence—“wrapped… blew… began”—echoes ritual without monotony. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms ghost story tropes through forensic specificity: dreams as data points, ghosts as cameo fragments in strangers’ subconscious. The “windows of connection” concept feels fresh because it’s operationalized, not mystical. Emotional truth anchors novelty—Maren’s desire isn’t justice but purity of record. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over plot mechanics) heightens stakes by making truth feel fragile, recoverable only through disciplined attention. No derivative echoes; voice and setting cohere into singular vision.</comment>
