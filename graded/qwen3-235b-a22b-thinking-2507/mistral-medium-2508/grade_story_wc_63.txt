<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("ethical diligence" vs unspoken guilt) manifests in embodied micro-choices (carving names as weights); final decision to carve next name earned by prior causality with visible cost (splintering palm).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: "Elias smiled. Then he reached for his knife..." crystallizes stance with felt cost (splintered palm) under Accumulative lens; sea's release mirrors held breath in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Broken rake handle constrains choice (carving names as counterweights) and charges final image (splintered edges); tidal obsidian ridge's glistening veins directly pressure the bob's descent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation through density increase: pendulum's "heavier" pause forces confrontation with carved names; cost legible in "rake handle splintered further" as Elias chooses to continue.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (notched names as weights), but "Absolution... was the slow act..." slightly edges toward thematic echo despite earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("brass teardrop suspended in the hush between ticks") modulates rhythm under pressure; no head-hopping; compression taught early via pendulum's pause.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sea hissed against the ridge like a held breath released" exemplifies purposeful lyric density without muddle; final line's cadence shift propels closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clock mechanics and moral accounting via carved names; avoids safety middle through searing specificity of "wet iron and kelp" scent in crisis.</comment>
