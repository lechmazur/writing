<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "trawling for meaning" vs. "euthanasia tourist" duality; embodied emotion peaks when her laugh "belonged to someone who still expected good things," revealing character under pressure without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "Endings Matter" etching transforms her clinic cancellation into earned renunciation; the ice groan as "door closing" crystallizes Charged Poise with visceral weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Parasol tip functions as micro-setting—its silver glint tests ice safety, its unscrewing reveals *E.M.*, charging the final image; sensory specificity ("scent of salt and distant rain") anchors theme without symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally: ice split forces dog rescue, parasol discovery narrows options to cancel clinic; cost is legible when she accepts dried fish "like a reason to postpone," altering her death timeline.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through "fold in patience" reweighted by ice walk; final image ("space between one breath and the next") offers resonant answer to "sound of approaching endings" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature evident in ice-focused sensory hierarchy ("bones humming with quiet frequency"); rhythmic control under pressure peaks in "she moved as if patience were something you could fold into the creases of your palms."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "groaning hull" motif avoids overwriting; slight density dip in "trawling for meaning" phrase, but propulsion remains clean with concrete verbs ("dug," "bolted," "knelt").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "euthanasia tourist" trope via disaster relief context; emotional specificity in "laugh that belonged to someone who still expected good things" avoids generic despair-to-hope arc.</comment>
