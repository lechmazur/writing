<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora's contradictory impulses (love as excavation/grief as mallet) manifest in embodied micro-choices like clawing through bead resonance. Keeper's pressure crystallizes stakes without reducing her to plot device. Slight abstraction in "hunger" lacks full physicality but closure's dissolution proves cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: pressure tightens via Liora's costly appearances culminating in bead's destruction. Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with undeniable cost: "veil began to unravel, thread by thread" as debt paid. Orientation clear by line 3; no causality breaks in 798-word scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Greenhouse constrains every choice: alchemical loam dissolves bones, black sap vial sustains Liora's attempts. Bead as micro-setting charges closure—"crumbled" while orchard "held the echo." "Silver-throated nightshade" blooms show setting altering tactics through poison economy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes signaled immediately: "debt older than orchard." Escalation via Accumulative lens—each cameo appearance costs Liora essence, deepening to final dissolution. Agency clear in "unspooling essence into bead's hunger"; cost undeniable in veil unraveling. Keeper's "drain it dry" shows tactical consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "lovingly venomous" manifests as nightshade blooms and rotting roses scent. Final image of "winter-cracked fields" versus "orchard breathes" offers non-literal answer to debt's cyclical nature. No moralizing—dawn "wound healing backward" reweights premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "moonlight split like a knife," "petals crumbling" voice. Rhythm modulates perfectly with pressure—fragmented syntax during climax ("The bead crumbled. Its song died."). Zero register drift; keeper's dialogue ("venomous") distinct yet coherent with Liora's POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "glass groaned as oldest tree split open" shows high density. Figurative language serves meaning: "dawn like wound healing backward" deepens closure without muddle. Final line "Again." demonstrates rhythmic control. One near-miss: "hush of winter-cracked fields" echoes opening but pays off as motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope through alchemical specificity: bead "drank last breath," nightshade blooms as love's residue. Emotional truth in "lovingly venomous" concept. Fresh inflection: debt paid via resonance rather than ritual. "Half-skeleton, half-sapling" Vesper feels inevitable, not quirky.</comment>
