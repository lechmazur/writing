<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "chaste courtesan" defying through action, but motivation lacks concrete stakes beyond abstract defiance; "She had been called worse" tells rather than embodies history.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost: snapped threads seal the gates as Liora absorbs echoes, her laughter reconfiguring "madness" into freedom; prism shudder during final echo slightly muddies causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Snow and threads constrain every choice—frost-tracing hands, brittle sorrow thread, melting snow at climax—charging the final image where snow "melted where she stood" as tangible defiance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through thread-untangling: laughter/sorrow/vein pulses narrow options toward sanctuary entry; cost crystallizes when threads snap sealing her inside, but conformity's threat remains abstractly rendered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</comment><comment>Theme emerges through "unstilled voices" and melting snow, avoiding moralizing; "set them free" borders on stated moral but redeemed by final image showing liberation as physical thaw.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature masterful: "shattered glass" snow, "blades of color," threads humming like plucked strings; rhythm shifts from surgical precision to avalanche-like intensity under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Three-thread sequence suffers template cadence ("first thread... second thread... third thread") dulling immediacy; otherwise lush prose achieves crystalline propulsion in final paragraphs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "echoes as ghosts" and threads-as-lives avoids trope; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes but prism mechanics verge on familiar fantasy lexicon.</comment>
