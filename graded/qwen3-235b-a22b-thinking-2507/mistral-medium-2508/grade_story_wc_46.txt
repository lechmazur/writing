<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s embodied grief ("hollows into her ribs") and micro-choices (thumb-polishing sea glass) reveal contradictory impulses: keeper of light yet haunted by Elias’ fire burial. Final renunciation of fire-based legacy earns cost via the girl’s "knuckles white with understanding."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visible cost: Liora’s "light isn’t taken, it’s become" forecloses fire-reliance, crystallized by the girl’s physical grasp. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density intensifies through sea glass/amber reprises—though lens ambiguity early caps score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The grotto’s serpentine walls actively constrain choices (mist-parting for the girl’s arrival), while sea glass physically warms in Liora’s palm, charging the final image. Micro-setting (tool as environment) meets 9+ gate by altering tactics through tactile pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen when the child requests "how to keep it," narrowing Liora’s options to transmission or isolation. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency (sharing sea glass), but Elias’ backstory relies slightly on coincidence, muting cost legibility despite the girl’s visceral reaction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "pearl of stillness" evolves from childhood memory to actionable philosophy without moralizing. Final image—"stars watched from quiet places"—delivers Conceptual Repricing, reweighting light as endurance with undeniable social cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "calloused from gem polishing" filters all description. Rhythmic control modulates under pressure (shorter sentences as mist thickens), while purposeful lyric compression ("mist like a sleeping serpent") is taught early and pays off in closure’s "serpentine peace."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold except redundant "reflectively vibrant" descriptor (Q9D), dulling sea glass’s final beat. Otherwise, high density propels closure: "knuckles white with weight" conveys cost in 4 words. Figurative language stays coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "wise elder" trope via specific mechanics: gem polishing as light-keeping metaphor, sea glass warming physically. Emotional truth in Liora’s quiet refusal of fire avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring Earned Stasis closure.</comment>
