<question>1</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Elira's motivation crystallizes through embodied contradiction: dying hands remodelling orchard as devotion, not defiance. Micro-choice of wrapping sapling while joints "crack like old timber" earns final endurance with visceral cost. Brother Tomas applies immediate pressure via status dynamics in sparse dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Tomas weaving copper after Elira's death reconfigures stakes with undeniable conceptual cost ("stubborn to the last, remodeling the world"). Accumulative lens holds—density builds through creaking wood/chiming copper until sapling's dawn turn crystallizes the cost. "Hand still warm" proves cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Copper wire functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (Tomas wrapping it) and constrains choices: guides sapling growth, feeds trees via oxidation, becomes legacy object. Stone pillars' "slow pulse" mirrors Elira's failing breath, making environment inseparable from bodily cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation: elders' "symmetry" doctrine versus symbiotic bending. One tightening—Tomas' shift from skepticism to action—narrowing options via agency. Cost is Elira's life, legible in "breath shallow but steady" and the sapling's dawn turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: copper wire "teaching trees to ask" reweights respect as bending, not standing straight. Final diary quote ("We were never meant to outlast the things we love") resonates without moralizing, charged by Tomas' silent continuation of the work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "petals veined with faint green" reflects Elira's botanical focus. Rhythmic control under pressure—"knees cracking like old timber" accelerates tension while humming slows pace. Dialogue carries subtext: "teaching them to beg" vs "teaching them to ask" reveals status shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("breath to something thin, like wind through dead leaves"). Figurative language sparse but potent: "leaves trembled in response" charges action. Final line ("pillars sighed, welcoming another pair of hands") recharges motif without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Transforms "dying caretaker" trope through specific symbiosis mechanics. Copper wire method feels inevitable yet fresh—"oxidized just enough to feed trees without poisoning" shows irreplaceable detail. Emotional truth in "remodeling the world into something kinder" avoids abstraction.</comment>
