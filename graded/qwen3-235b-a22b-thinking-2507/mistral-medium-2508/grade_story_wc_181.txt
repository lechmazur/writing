<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied contradictions shine (trembling fingers vs. sharp laugh), but orchard visions lack sufficient internal struggle during pivotal stance crystallization; micro-choices like pressing cameo to temple reveal character under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Veyra's "do neither" renunciation forecloses paths with visible cost (cameo's transformation), under Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation anchors within 40 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Astral orchard functions as micro-setting constraint: fractal pollen equations dictate knowledge access, while bathroom acoustics enable the breakthrough; pistachio shell's texture charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stewardship vs. exploitation) tightens through Veyra's active rejection of predecessors' paths; cost legible in "do neither," but orchard visions lack distinct pressure escalation between choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final catalog entry reweights theme through action: "a key that unlocks only when held by someone who understands they shouldn’t turn it" reframes stewardship without moralizing; earned through concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bureaucrat’s ledger," "fractal patterns—each bloom a silent argument against linear time"); register shifts organically under pressure, with reflection’s static-laced dialogue avoiding ventriloquism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("ink that smelled faintly of violet sap" compresses theme, setting, and consequence); only hairline slip is semicolon use in thematic line, but rhythm remains propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specificity: pistachio shell cameo as knowledge vessel feels inevitable, not quirky; risk-taking (reflection dialogue, orchard visions) heightens stakes without obscuring Charged Poise closure.</comment>
