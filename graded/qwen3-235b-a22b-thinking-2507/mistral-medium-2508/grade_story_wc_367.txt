<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority shines through embodied contradictions ("laughter wasn’t joy. It was a weapon") and micro-choices under pressure, like twisting the wick to resist the shadow. Motivation rooted in cyclical duty feels earned, though minimal backstory limits deeper flaw exploration without violating BRR.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "the work was never done. That was the point" crystallizes eternal struggle with visceral cost (her warm hands, counting hours). Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density tightens pressure toward the shadow’s appearance without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The glass lantern wick constrains every critical choice—adjusting it shapes the storm, and its "drowning man" flame visually charges the final image. Emerald lighthouse functions as micro-setting, with salt-worn stairs and ozone smell directly altering Liora’s tactics during the confrontation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Liora’s agency: the shadow’s approach forces her to tighten the light’s beam ("You can’t have it, Not yet"), narrowing options to endurance. Cost is legible in her cyclical burden ("her heart already counting the hours"), reweighting the dominant stake via Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: "shape the dawn using ancient shadows" avoids moralizing, with the final image ("thousand unprinted headlines") offering resonant, non-literal answer to guardianship’s cost. No thematic echo; complexity lives in her "blessed/cursed" duality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV voice is distinct and pressured: "the light refracted—not outward, but inward" reflects Liora’s focused perception. Rhythmic control peaks in high-stress moments ("The wind howling... like a chorus of the long-dead"), with zero head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences like "the stars above wavered, their positions shifting like dice" deliver multi-jobbing clarity. Figurative language ("drowning man reaching for the surface") avoids muddle in peak beats, with propulsion matching the storm’s intensity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse tropes through specific stakes: laughter as weapon and light guiding shadows feel fresh. Risk-taking in tone ("shadowed elation") heightens coherence, with the emerald lighthouse’s "hunger" making the premise singular and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
