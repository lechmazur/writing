<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (chasing forward vs. contraction truth) drives final choice; embodied emotion in trembling fingers and breath fogging glass avoids abstraction; micro-choices with coins reveal hierarchy of values under cosmic pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: dissolution/rebirth reconfigures "beginning" with felt stakes in the heartbeat pulse; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through static-to-harmonic cadence shift; cost legible in "atom by atom" disintegration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Amber observatory walls function as micro-setting: their vibration constrains the coin arrangement choice and charges the final image ("trapped dawn" reversal); sensory details (pitted disc, static bursts) filtered through Liora’s pattern-obsession bias enhance urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via static sharpening → resolved question → harmonic vibration narrows options to dissolution; dominant stake (aligning with purpose) tightens through Liora’s agency in arranging coins; cost crystallized in the rebirth’s conceptual weight ("coins smooth now, unmarked by time").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: coins as mirrors reframing "beginning" avoids moralizing; final whisper reweights contraction as choice with the heartbeat pulse offering non-literal answer to cosmic doubt without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "static bursts flicker like distant Morse" and wavelength-focused noticing; rhythmic control peaks in fragmented climax ("it moved"); elision of other characters taught early via "the others had cast lots" without POV leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "static wasn’t noise. It was a voice" compression; no figurative muddle in closure beats; final line’s propulsion ("it moved") recharges static motif without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms cosmic rebirth trope through specific wavelength mechanics and coin mirrors; emotional truth in "chasing forward momentum" versus contraction reality; bold structural choice (backwards prophecy as invitation) heightens stakes coherently to closure.</comment>
