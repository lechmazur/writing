<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s embodied contradiction—trembling from "weight of silence," not fear—grounds her clairvoyant flaw in concrete sensory detail. Micro-choice to leave the pearl earns transformation through prior causality (her realization about "magnifying" ordinary moments), avoiding diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: "magic wasn’t something you seized. It was something you inhabited" reweights the premise with visible cost (leaving the pearl, changed gait). Accumulative lens holds throughout, with sensory density tightening pressure toward the final image’s charge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The cave’s pulsing stone and refracting crystals constrain Liora’s movement and perception, directly shaping her climax realization. Final image ("cave’s music faded... but its lesson lingered") charges closure through the setting’s physical legacy, hitting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single deepening ("pearl pulsed... suddenly she understood") sufficiently narrows Liora’s options under Accumulative lens, shifting her from seeker to vessel. Cost legibility stumbles slightly—the "baker kneading dough" vision lacks tangible forfeiture—but final stance crystallization ("hands empty, heart full") compensates.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through charged particulars: the child’s handprint in cement reweights the pearl’s "quiet wonder" without moralizing. Final line ("magic meant to be felt") offers non-literal answer to central question, avoiding thematic echo while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("colors that moved when no one watched") filters all detail through Liora’s clairvoyant bias. Rhythmic control under pressure ("shadows deepened, then folded") modulates voice without elision—no head-hopping despite entity’s presence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or syntax monotony; "starlight trapped in tar" risks overwriting but stays voice-motivated. One paraphrase loop ("cave’s song would unravel her... cave’s song made her heart ache") deducts minimally, avoiding closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "magical cave" trope through specific physics (sound-refracting crystals) and emotional truth (clarity through surrender). Risk-taking (entity as "lens," not threat) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "bright darkness" leans slightly familiar.</comment>
