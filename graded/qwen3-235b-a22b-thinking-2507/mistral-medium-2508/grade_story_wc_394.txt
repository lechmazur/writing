<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "fall felt like a method, not a mistake" and melted arrow becoming part of her algorithm—flaws (repeated crashes) compound growth without safety-hedging. "Steadily curious" is embodied via actions like cranking the kaleidoscope, not labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: workshop collapse crystallizes stakes ("wreckage" vs. "first draft"), with visible cost in ruins and melted arrow. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density buildup to "conducting" the air—cost legible in "ruins of Vex’s dream."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Acid sea isn’t backdrop but active antagonist—hisses during crashes, burns when skimmed, burps post-victory. Micro-setting (arrow tip melting into chestplate) constrains her final state and charges the humming-tune closure. Every detail serves pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Pip’s agency: kaleidoscope cranking transforms doubts into blueprint, arrow’s glow during skim forces the conducting leap. Workshop collapse carries conceptual cost ("first draft"), narrowing options to relentless iteration—no coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "yearning algorithm" evolves from "loop of almost" to recalculating runes, avoiding moralizing. Final silence of the bell answers the central question—"work to do"—with resonant ambiguity, rejecting tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in tactile compression: "three of them new, two of them borrowed" and "wind screamed but wings listened." Stress shortens syntax ("She wasn’t falling. She was conducting.") without voice leakage—zero dialogue but internal rhythm modulates perfectly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "brass ribs groaning as fumes ate them" and "pullled air" show inventive density. Final line avoids abstraction via "acid sea burped," grounding "irreverent awe" in concrete action—no figurative muddle even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms flying trope via cart glider mechanics and acid sea stakes—emotional truth in "fall felt like a method." Risk-taking (workshop collapse as victory) heightens coherence; no derivative echoes, only specific, verifiable details like obsidian arrow runes.</comment>
