<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora's embodied grief ("hands steady from years of mapping stars traced symbols") and contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. transcribing as rebellion) power the climax. Brother's manifestation risks convenience but is earned by her prior "sculpt space for echo" motivation and the tile's established physicality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "she didn’t need the tile anymore" crystallizes her shift from skeptic to "cartographer of echoes" with felt cost (ephemeral brother, permanent memory). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as whale songs and symbols accumulate density until space bends inward.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tower and tile constrain choices: obsidian tile’s physical warmth guides her hand during transcription, while the open tower’s "bending like wax" directly enables the brother’s appearance. Whale-spray scent in the final lines charges the closure image with sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Liora’s agency: her transcription choices narrow options from "scoffed at magic" to "carve the whole sky," culminating in the tile’s glow enabling the brother’s appearance. Cost is legible in "the memory stayed, woven into the tower’s bones" after the tile dims.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</comment><comment>Theme emerges from concrete actions: "transcribing the horizon / Not as a map, but as a door" reweights the central question without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality by grounding wisdom in physical details like ink-stained fingers and tide pools holding "hundred more tiles."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in selective details ("whale-spray and old ink" scent, "bioluminescent waves" glow). Minor deduction for "courageously kind thought" momentarily slipping into label-speak before physicalizing ("tile warmed against her wrist like a pulse").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line multiplies meaning ("parchment dissolving like salt in rain" compresses loss and transience). Only flaw: "courageously kind thought" slightly disrupts rhythm but is redeemed by immediate physical manifestation in the next clause.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes through specific mechanics: transcribing as "sculpting reflections" and "entangled memories" as spatial bending. Fresh inflection in the tide pools holding "hundred more tiles," implying communal healing beyond individual arc.</comment>
