<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (fear/legacy vs need/connection) drive the mural completion; "hands shook" embodies cost without labels. Final choice to sketch faces rather than map earns closure through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: "weight... lighter" shows visceral cost while "thread he could choose" reconfigures legacy. Accumulative lens holds—density peaks at mural alignment with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Ivy passage actively constrains choices (ivy-choked path vs sealed door); film negative's brittleness charges the climax. Micro-setting (rocking chair mid-sway) directly shapes Elias's final action and image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Legacy burden tightens relentlessly: echoes swell, negative burns in pocket, door groans open. Agency peaks when match lights the varnish—foreclosing mystery path with visible cost in trembling hands and completed mural.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Final image ("it sang") reweights "walls remember" without moralizing. Theme emerges through mural completion: legacy as living thread, not chain. Avoids false equivalence—legacy's burden is complex but not balanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "echoes swelled into a chorus," "breath visible in the cold." Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure—short sentences at climax ("His hands shook")—with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "plastic brittle between his fingers" shows textural density. Final line’s cadence ("Some dreams... lived") recharges ivy motif without muddle. No figurative artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "haunted house" trope through echo cartography. Emotional specificity in legacy exploration avoids templates. Risk-taking (quiet closure where corridor sings) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
