<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lirien’s contradictory impulses (theft as amendment, legacy as burden) act in scene, but the Keeper’s emotional shift lacks visible cost scaling to length; "apprentice of wonder" backstory tells rather than shows prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost—the Keeper’s worldview shift—but the retroactive "map to right sky" in the knight weakens causality; cost proof hovers near but lacks exact on-page sentence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ice spire functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (footholds reshaping during descent); recurring chess pieces constrain choices and reweight meaning at closure with felt cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lirien’s precise actions, but escalation isn’t driven by her agency—the Keeper’s emotional turn feels coincidental, not earned through coherent pressure under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the sundial’s light transformation (violet to breathing blue), but the chess piece map feels like thematic overreach that resolves off-page, muddying the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fingers numbed by more than cold") and rhythmic control under pressure; minor register drift in "bones of saints and sinners" slightly jars the established voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>No scaffold loops or figurative muddle; "sky twisting like a wound" slightly strains coherence in a high-pressure beat, but propulsion remains clean through the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of thief motif with time-amendment; "ink from first tear" specificity elevates trope, but the knight’s map feels derivative, capping risk distinction below 9.0 threshold.</comment>
