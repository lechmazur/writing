<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s ambition manifests in precise actions (stealing seed, parsing scents) and embodied contradictions (rebellion vs craving serenity). Her micro-choices under pressure—planting despite Elders’ gathering—reveal hierarchy of values. Final renunciation of stillness feels earned by journal doodles exposing hidden truths, though grandmother’s reflection slightly edges toward convenient wisdom.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visible cost: Liora abandons pursuit of stillness, accepting sway as serenity, while Elders’ softening and unlocked vault prove relational consequence. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—perfume’s density intensifies until the mirror-reflection crystallizes stakes. Tide’s turning bookends the cost without retroactive patches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Corpse flower constrains every choice (theft, planting, Elders’ confrontation) and charges the final image—vines strung on new bridge reconfigure "sway" as embrace. Sensory hierarchy (olfactory obsession, tactile doodles) reflects herbalist POV, avoiding tourist cataloging. Journal’s brown paper wrapping subtly mirrors village’s woven bridges.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stake (serenity within motion) tightens through Liora’s agency: planting accelerates Elders’ arrival, flower’s visions force confrontation. Cost is unmistakable—the exposed village secrets and unlocked vault alter future dynamics. Tide’s turning isn’t a clock but a pressure wave; her realization forecloses stillness as a path while deepening the dominant stake’s meaning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through particulars: corpse flower as mirror reframes "undercurrent of wisdom" as trust, dodging moralizing. Final line ("sway felt like an embrace") resonates non-literally with the treetop setting, charging prior swaying bridges. No abstract assertions—doodles and petal press embody earned complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (olfactory syntax: "rotting honey, buried secrets"; herbalist’s precision in "parsing grief in wilting lavender"). Rhythm modulates from measured theft to breathless bloom. Minor register drift in "conceptual cost" phrasing, but lyrical compression ("tide’s slow breath") taught early pays off in closure’s embrace.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; every line advances texture or stakes ("petals streaked with veins of silver" conveys both image and thematic duality). Final image ("sway of trees felt like an embrace") crystallizes closure without overwriting. "Bruise" for tendril color risks cliché but is redeemed by "sigh that smelled of wet earth and old bones"—concrete specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "forbidden wisdom" trope through treetop village’s sway logic and doodle-language specificity. Emotional truth in Liora’s hunger (not rebellion) for serenity avoids middle-ground hedging. The corpse flower as mirror—not oracle—feels inevitable in hindsight, synthesizing olfactory obsession with village’s unspoken fears.</comment>
