<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias's swallowed apologies versus Harkin's built absolution; embodied cost in "ink bled like a promise" avoids label-speak. Final renunciation of waiting for absolution is causally earned through the heart's challenge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "sleeves soaked, breath in time with mechanism's pulse" crystallizes the shift from passivity to action under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation clear by line 1; lens held through final "began" beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The clockwork heart constrains choice (soldering wires) and charges closure ("shop hummed with vibrant hush of second chances"). Stained-glass light fracturing across filigree directly enables the "light through cracks" thematic payoff without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias's agency: inserting heart into music box narrows options from reflection to irrevocable action. Cost is visceral—"sleeves soaked," ink bleeding—and legible in the post office beat, tightening the dominant stake of unearned absolution under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through Harkin's "mercy isn't currency" action, not sermonizing. Final image ("ready for the work") reweights "light through cracks" as active construction, avoiding moralizing. No thematic echo; cost is conceptual in "debts paid in words" versus deeds.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature sharp: chaplain notices "lavender and old hymnals," fractured light through stained glass. Rhythmic control under pressure—"rain lashing cobblestones in rhythm like warden’s footsteps"—modulates with emotional intensity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "gears turning as if to say: This is how you deserve the dawn" compresses time/theme. Propulsion flawless in climax—"He reached for his pen. Not to write another sermon..."—with no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "guilty chaplain" trope through tangible clockwork mechanics: Harkin builds absolution rather than seeking it. Emotional specificity in "twelve years" and "soldering wires" avoids abstraction; risk-taking in making mercy a physical act heightens stakes.</comment>
