<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s embodied grief (“weight of it familiar, like the expectantly resigned sigh”) grounds motivation, but secondary choir members lack interiority beyond symbolic traits; Earned Stasis closure earns high marks despite thin secondary pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (“The choir was still there. So was the sound”) crystallizes fragility with undeniable cost; Accumulative lens holds through density of silences, with orientation anchored by 78 words (“velvet library exhaled…amber across the shelves”).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: rosette constrains choice (humming “shape of one”) and charges final image (“vibrated, just slightly”); autumn leaves mirror internal states without cliché, meeting 9+ gate via object-as-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (preserving choir’s essence amid hatred’s erosion) tightens through arrival of members; Elias’s agency in reframing “presence over loudness” narrows options with felt cost, though timeframe vagueness slightly dulls escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme (“listening to the cracks”) emerges through action (humming negative space), not moralizing; final image reweights premise without stating moral, avoiding Thematic Echo despite high-risk abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines (“leaves a note falling silent”), with rhythmic control modulating stress (“thin as thread, weaving”); no head-hopping, voice remains Elias’s musical lens even in group moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density (“ghost of a plucked string, the harmonic hum”) with clear propulsion; metaphors cohere (“wind rattling the panes like an old man tapping his cane”) without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of “negative space” music reframes loss; specificity (“bullet-scarred folder,” “lacewood petals”) avoids template, while risk-taking (quiet climax) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
