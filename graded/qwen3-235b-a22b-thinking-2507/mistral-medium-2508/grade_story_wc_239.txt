<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("walking outward while journeying inward") and embodied emotion ("juice ran down his chin") power micro-choices under pressure, though motivation lacks prior conflict escalation; tearing the dictionary earns closure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly when the library collapses into the blank dictionary—"weight of being the end felt light" crystallizes conceptual cost under Accumulative/Textural lens with persistent constraint (language's instability).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Temple library (setting) charges closure: bone shelves/skin books constrain the witness's final act, while the dictionary (recurring object) evolves from relic to blank page, reweighting meaning in the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (unraveling cosmic illusions) tighten through dictionary's shifting definitions, narrowing options until tearing it becomes the only agency; cost is legible in "hinge between what was and what will never be" with conceptual price paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: blank dictionary as non-literal answer to "can meaning survive history's end?"—avoids moralizing while charging the final image with earned ambiguity about creation/destruction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust motes hung like suspended stars") and rhythmic control peak in "books tumbled... pages fluttering like wounded birds"; elision of time ("what felt like eons") taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "taste like memory" exemplifies high-density textural specificity, though "flavor of the first word" risks abstraction but avoids thematic echo via embodied action (biting fruit).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms cosmic library trope through language-as-living-arbitrator premise; "spiral arbitration" reconfigured as dying being's final act feels inevitable yet fresh, with risk-taking (lyric structure) heightening coherence.</comment>
