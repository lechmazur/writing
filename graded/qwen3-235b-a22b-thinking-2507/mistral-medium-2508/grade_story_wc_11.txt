<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority masterfully concrete ("exhaled—a sound like steam escaping"), avoiding diagnostic labels while showing contradictory impulses (methodical unraveling vs. reverence). Flaw: janitorial flaw's causal pressure on choices remains implicit rather than actively complicating present decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost (dissolution of reality), driven by Accumulative/Textural lens where timeline density reshapes stakes. Hairline slip: "looped timelines" mechanics slightly vague during escalation, though payoff crystallizes meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frozen courtyard functions as micro-setting, with ice-violin's fragility directly charging closure ("ice didn't shatter... it sang"). Misses 9.0 by lacking one tactile detail (e.g., cobblestone texture underfoot) to heighten constraint during pivotal bow-tightening moment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate purely through protagonist's agency (playing violin → triggering memory cascade), narrowing options from existential questioning to embodied remembering. Cost is visceral—reality dissolution—with no convenience; coincidence only complicates ("whisper from violin").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars ("pulling something always there"), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights premise: thoughts as active reaching, not passive logic. No thematic echo; ambiguity lingers in "ghost of fire" scent charging cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct robotic perceptual signature ("optical sensors zooming," "core temperature dropped") modulates rhythm during memory cascade. Zero head-hopping; elision of human backstory taught early via "glitch flickered" and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "amalgamated with twilight" shows virtuosic verb precision. Near-flaw: "remarkably composed" slightly tell-y, but immediately redeemed by embodied action ("fingers tightened on bow"). Peak beats maintain crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms robot trope via ice-violin's specific mechanics (harmony bending time). Risk-taking (timeline loops as map) heightens stakes coherently. Freshness lies in "remembering" as reclamation, not rebellion, with emotional truth in quiet despair of forgetting.</comment>
