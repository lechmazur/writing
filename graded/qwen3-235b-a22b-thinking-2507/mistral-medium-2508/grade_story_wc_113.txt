<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("wanted to disrupt") and embodied emotion ("damp against his thigh") deepen Elias; ghost's influence shown through micro-choices like tracing warped paper. Slight underdevelopment in why disruption matters beyond curiosity limits 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("felt like a duet") reconfigures silence with visceral cost (trembling fingers, dry program). Accumulative lens holds perfectly: water/lantern patterns intensify until the resonant final note. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Flooded opera house actively constrains choices (water resisting "like a held note"); cello and program function as micro-settings charging the duet image. Sensory details ("lantern light pooling unevenly") reflect urgency without checklist fatigue.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deciphering ghost's code) tightens through Elias' agency: wading to balcony, playing silence. Cost legible in physical reactions, but escalation lacks one visible trade-off (e.g., risk of injury in flooded space) for 9.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"In-between spaces" evolves from gaps to vessels via concrete actions (reading water stains, playing silence). Final image ("a duet") reweights theme without moralizing; avoids thematic echo through embodied resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sheet music into topographic map of shadows") and rhythmic control ("water lapped like a slow, patient tongue"). Minor register drift in "liminal place" slightly disrupts musical lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold; high density ("lanterns flickered above, their light pooling unevenly"). Near-loop in water metaphors ("resisting like a held note"/"water shivered") prevents 9.0, but closure remains crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope through musical specificity: silence as duet partner. Risk-taking with conceptual closure ("play the silence") heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional truth anchors novelty.</comment>
