<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("grief" crimson vs "resolve" violet heat-map) drives agency; bleeding fingers embody cost without label-speak. Final choice to play the storm earned by tactile interaction with the case, foreclosing escape with visible sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance ("she would raise it in song") with undeniable cost (blood on keys, heat-map burning). Accumulative lens holds: density increase ("jagged bursts... music of things breaking") reweights silence's cost without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Winterglass micro-setting constrains choice (frozen air shatters sound) and charges closure ("winterglass didn’t shatter. It sang"). Piano’s dust-covered strings become active pressure points, not backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating silence) signaled early; deepening through tactile realization ("case was a cipher") narrows options under Accumulative lens. Visible cost (bleeding fingers) alters tactics as she plays harder, reweighting silence’s meaning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through action: "she wasn’t translating silence into music. She was proving they’d been the same." Final image reweights premise without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo via embodied discovery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("breath fogging... uneven bursts") modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control ("Nothing. Of course.") conveys despair; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression ("raw, unshaken marvel") taught early pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion via concrete verbs ("pulsed," "shivered," "unraveling"). Figurative language ("warped and wet, like a voice rising from deep water") serves pressure without muddle. Final line recharges "only rhythm" motif with earned resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "music vs silence" trope through specific heat-map mechanics and winterglass physics. Emotional truth in tactile struggle (salt in veins, scars on hands) avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (silence as language) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
