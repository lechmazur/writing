<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "reimagine not rebuild/resurrect" and rejection of comfort. Final choice to conceive—foreclosing resurrection with visible cost (empty bottle)—is earned through prior causality. Minor competence convenience in alchemy knowledge, but mitigated by "half-mad" state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: town reborn but "work to do" implies ongoing cost, crystallized by bottle emptying. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—sensory density escalates to reconfigure stakes without causal breaks. Cost proof: "bottle grew lighter" as essence transfers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Amber bottle (tool) charges closure by rolling into tide as "unnecessary," while micro-setting (shifting sand, scent shifts) actively constrains choices. Sensory hierarchy masterful: decay replaced by cinnamon/charred meat precisely when concentration intensifies.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through sensory accumulation—laughter/footsteps raise "will it vanish?" cost. Escalation driven purely by alchemist's concentration (agency), not coincidence. Cost unmistakable: bottle lightens as memory becomes tangible, altering tactics toward sustaining the town.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "memory was the spark" crystallized in the sticky hand, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "conception" as active creation ("not resurrection... second beginning"), with earned ambiguity about sustainability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: alchemist notices scents before sights ("cinnamon and charred meat" before visual crowds). Rhythmic control under pressure—short sentences during tension ("He didn’t dare open his eyes")—taught early via "phosphorescent tide" lyric compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density throughout. Peak beats avoid figurative muddle: "ghosts with weight, with warmth" conveys conceptual cost without abstraction. Closure propulsion flawless—"rolled from his palm into the tide" shows consequence through action, not explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "conception" as alchemy of memory (not magic) avoids tropey revival. Emotional truth in "half-mad" protagonist—risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passed: swap "alchemist" for "shaman" and emotional calculus collapses.</comment>
