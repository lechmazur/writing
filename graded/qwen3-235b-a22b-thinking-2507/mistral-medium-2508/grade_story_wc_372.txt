<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear ("extraction not preservation") but final choice lacks prior causality; the woman's sudden appearance as invitation isn't earned by earlier micro-choices, weakening the crucial closure cost despite strong embodied emotion in trembling hands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "the light bent. And the world remade itself" crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost (abandoning measurement for connection), validated by Accumulative/Textural lens where sensory density builds to this reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frozen library constrains choice (collapsing shelves force urgency) and charges the final image (dissolving into stardust); "lantern slide’s warmth against his thigh" during the decision proves micro-setting shapes tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through vow dissolution ("time running out") but dominant conflict shifts abruptly from preservation to pursuit without showing Elias's internal trade-off; the cost of joining her feels conceptual rather than viscerally felt in the beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "measuring what could not be held" reweights to "a beginning" in the final image without moralizing, but the sudden vow-as-invitation risks thematic convenience without deeper groundwork in Elias's longing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("quartz hush," "frequencies singing in his bones") modulates perfectly with pressure; rhythmic control in short sentences during collapse ("The library shuddered. Ice shifted.") avoids head-hopping while deepening urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-zero loops with high density ("prism of blue and silver across the ice" does triple duty), but "singing in his bones" edges toward therapy-speak in a peak beat, slightly dulling the closure image's immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library-as-grave trope through "luminous vows" mechanic; risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off, but the woman's sudden appearance as solution lacks sufficient transformation from prior particulars to breach 9.0.</comment>
