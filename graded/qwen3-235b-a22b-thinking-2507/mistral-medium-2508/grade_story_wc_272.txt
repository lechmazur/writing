<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "clinging to broken frames" vs. surrendering to library's hunger, but "ache of a muscle" edges toward therapy-speak (+0.2 penalty). Final renunciation of artist identity as canvas earns visible cost through "she let it go."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "the dark opened as presence" reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost ("luminescent ache" as bone-deep truth). Accumulative lens holds through tarot's meaning-weaving, with "walls closing in" charging the final image without soft reset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: tarot box constrains choice (redesigning fragments) and charges closure ("seams glowing faintly"). Lighthouse-library fusion avoids white-room syndrome via "cane seat unraveling" tactile detail, though "bruise" sky cliché slightly dilutes specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: Elara's "redesign" action forecloses escape path, trading control for truth. Cost is visceral in "let the library’s hunger guide her," though "necessary dark" motivation could deepen earlier beyond whispered questions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tarot’s metamorphosis: "Tower’s collapse became a doorway" reweights fragmentation as truth. Final image ("brushstroke connecting bruise and mirror") resonates without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite high-band risk.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless: "eyes like storm-tossed glass" filters all detail through artist’s lens. Rhythmic control peaks in climax ("Her hands moved without thought..."), though "luminescent ache" repetition slightly blurs voice specificity under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops but "scent that clung to the back of the throat" followed by "air thick with scent" risks paraphrase (-0.2). Propulsion falters slightly in "books sighing" passage, yet final line’s sparse cadence ("exhaled... swallowed it entirely") achieves crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse trope via tarot’s tactile philosophy: "redesign not with glue" synthesizes grief into actionable metaphor. Risk-taking (dark as presence) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "necessary dark" edges toward familiar lyrical shorthand.</comment>
