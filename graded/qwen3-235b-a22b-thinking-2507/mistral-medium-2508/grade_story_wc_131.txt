<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through Elias’s methodical caching versus reckless exposure; embodied emotion in "breath shallow" and "pulse loud" avoids labels. Final choice earned by seventeen years of silent witnessing, but the woman’s instant recognition lacks layered reaction depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: Elias stepping into light forecloses invisibility. Accumulative lens holds as sensory fragments reconfigure meaning. Minor deduction: outage’s causal role in Elias’s shift remains underdeveloped despite "cracked something open" setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dust-moted air and ferromagnetic tape function as micro-setting, constraining choices (tape’s warmth enabling delivery) and charging the final image. "Sapphire hush" evolves from atmosphere to tactile pressure during the woman’s realization. No generic placeholders; every detail serves the cache’s physicality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency: caching (endurance) shifts to exposing himself (renunciation of safety). The outage’s erratic flickering narrows options, but the transition from observation to action lacks sufficient escalation—his "reckless" move feels sudden without clearer internal friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tactile memory: the laugh fragment reweights both characters’ pasts without abstraction. Final key exchange offers non-literal answer to "visibility" question. Avoids moralizing, though "something else had begun" slightly overstates resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: Elias notices "calloused fingers" and "draft" while ignoring visual cues. Voice modulates from sparse ("He cached things like this") to lyrical ("laugh spilling out in fragments"). Minor register drift in "conceptual cost" phrasing disrupts immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose sings in sensory moments ("cobalt and amethyst," "warm from body heat") but falters in high-pressure beats: "jagged, like a gasp" feels abstract for outage description. Zero scaffold, yet "pulse loud in ears" edges toward cliché. Final line’s "dawn light found them" lacks the earlier precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "memory fragment" trope through ferromagnetic tape’s physical constraints and Elias’s methodical caching. Fresh inflection in the woman recognizing her own childhood laugh—specific, non-obvious synthesis. Avoids safety middle with raw, unresolved tension in their silent exchange.</comment>
