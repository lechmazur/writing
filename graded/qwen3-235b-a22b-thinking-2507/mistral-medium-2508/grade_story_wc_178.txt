<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Qishti’s frugality and scientific rigor drive every micro-choice (counting tiles, tracing schematics), with embodied contradiction in his "empirically ironic thrill." Final kneeling as earned renunciation of pure rationality carries visible cost: his hands now bear the tile’s lines.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "some devotions are too vast for numbers" reconfigures his worldview, made legible by the stars now "intimate." Accumulative lens holds—density of schematics deepens stakes until the altar’s flare rewrites meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tile functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (stealthy retrieval, decoding) and charges the final image—its lines rewoven onto Qishti’s skin, transforming him from observer to participant in the "dialogue."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Qishti’s agency: decoding evolves from curiosity to covenant-sealing, narrowing options until the passage forces faith over science. Cost is visceral in the final image—his threadbare robe unchanged, but the stars now "burn just a little brighter" with intimate weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: "What is measured is never lost" evolves into the non-literal answer that "devotions are too vast for numbers." Avoids moralizing by embedding wisdom in Qishti’s skin-deep transformation, not abstract assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("counting tiles to avoid guards’ notice," "empirically ironic thrill") modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control peaks in the altar scene: short clauses ("He placed the tile. The schematics flared") mirror his decisive shift from calculation to faith.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "The tile was warm beneath his fingers, though the air was cool" compresses setting, mystery, and sensory contrast without scaffold. One minor density slip—"mapping celestial paths" then "mapping their relationships"—avoids overwriting by serving character.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "magic tile" trope through Babylonian specificity (ziggurat, cuneiform reference) and emotional truth: Qishti’s devotion to the unknown reshapes science into intimacy. Risk-taking (lyric compression, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
