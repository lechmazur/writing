<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "grounding is flight" realization, but brother's presence as character remains ambiguous (reflection-only), slightly muddying relationship causality at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost in "last boundary... fade into twilight’s glow," though "centuries" phrasing risks abstracting the temporal stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard's frost-to-constellations transformation constrains choice (sextant angling) and charges the final "fruit of light" image, fulfilling 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fog pressed in like a second skin" exemplifies high-density propulsion, but "centuries" risks lexical illusion against established temporal scale.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mirror/sextant mechanics transforms celestial longing trope, though "fruit of light" slightly echoes common magical realism imagery without full transformation.</comment>
