<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between observation and intervention crystallizes in the "weighted breath" moment; embodied hesitation ("breath curl and dissipate") earns the final choice with visceral cost on the ice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: stepping "into the space between seeing and doing" reconfigures stakes with felt cost ("ice groaned... eager"), under Accumulative lens where density shifts (shattering mirrors) reweight the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ice floes function as micro-setting that constrains choice (dusk timing, footing) and charges the final image ("ice groaned again, closer now"); orchard's "branches clicking like bones" mirrors internal pressure without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias' agency under Accumulative lens: visions accumulate pressure until his stance crystallizes ("not as a peacekeeper... but as the one foolish enough"), with visible cost legible in the ice's proximity during his step.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of empathy-as-action emerges through concrete particulars (mirrors shattering as he intervenes), avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights "courage" by showing shared risk without abstract resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("breath curl and dissipate," "light bent just so") modulates rhythm under pressure; syntactic compression ("He stepped forward...") heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity or voice consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where every phrase advances atmosphere or tension (e.g., "branches clicking like bones" implies danger); final line's "glimpses finally whole" avoids figurative muddle while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse trope through specific synthesis (orchard on cliff, vintage mirrors); risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes by making the ice's hunger feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
