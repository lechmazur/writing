<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prince Aldric’s interior contradiction (hope/despair) manifests in trembling hands and "quaking certainty" during the egg-piercing beat; his decade-long obsession with beauty’s rebirth compels irreversible action with visible cost ("bitter aftertaste of hope").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options: the flawed sky-singer’s flight reconfigures "beauty should be effortless" with palpable cost (palace shuddering, abyss yawning); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density escalation to the refracted-light finale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Suspended palace chains and the egg’s micro-setting constrain every choice—Aldric’s salt-stiffened robes limit movement, the egg’s membrane dictates delicate tools; final image of glass wings refracting "dying light into something almost holy" charges closure through environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (beauty’s rebirth in mechanized world) tightens when the egg "unfolds" into flawed genesis; cost is visceral—the palace groans, wings scrape stalactites—driven by Aldric’s agency (piercing membrane) under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the glass-winged creature’s "grind of gears trying to mimic" song; final line’s "quaking reverie of a world learning to breathe again" reweights prior material without moralizing, embracing complexity of flawed rebirth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in Aldric’s selective attention ("air tasted of rust," "fractured rainbows"); rhythmic control modulates under pressure—short sentences for the crack, lyrical flow for the unfolding—with zero head-hopping in single POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("veins of gold pulsed beneath translucent skin" conveys biology, light, motion); figurative language ("held breath breaking") clarifies pressure without muddle in the pivotal hatching beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "reviving ancient magic" trope via specific, grounded choices: sky-singer’s glass wings and gear-grind song synthesize loss/longing; emotional truth in "beauty shouldn’t taste of rust" avoids generic templates.</comment>
