<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (preservation vs fear) act simultaneously during conjuring; final choice to invite beings earns endurance with visible cost (fissure, stone darkening). No diagnostic label-speak despite high-stakes pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "ice groaned... fissure split" and stone's darkening show physical/emotional toll. Accumulative lens holds—density builds through ice patterns until harmonic shift reconfigures stakes. Cost legible in "the bloom of hush *sang*."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (echo chamber stone) constrains all choices: its luminosity enables reading ice, warming with breath drives climax. Final image ("stone warm against his skin, ready to read") charges the tool with renewal, fulfilling 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Eldrin's agency under Accumulative lens—methodical ice-reading deepens pressure until the bloom's invitation. Cost unmistakable: fissure splitting ground and stone darkening foreclose resistance path. Single deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "bloom of hush" as balance reweights chaos. Final image ("fresh cracks... beginning of an answer") offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo while embracing complexity (beings' song fracturing into questions).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("stone remembered every tremor") with rhythmic control under pressure—short sentences crystallize climax ("The ice groaned. A fissure split..."). Elision taught early (no backstory) and paid off through sensory immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("veins of quartz catching dim light like trapped lightning" does triple duty). No figurative muddle in peak beats. Final line ("storm had become a lullaby") crystallizes theme without cliché. Text-artifact free.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "harmony vs chaos" trope via specific mechanics (ice fracture patterns as language). "Bloom of hush" concept feels fresh; risk-taking (avoiding battle for invitation) heightens stakes coherently. Emotional truth in quiet resistance elevates beyond surface novelty.</comment>
