<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Liora's preservation impulse versus destructive act, but the shift from repair to breaking lacks embodied micro-choices under peak pressure; "hands trembled" anchors emotion yet the critical decision feels abrupt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "some things were not meant to be preserved. Only mourned" reconfigures the library's meaning with visceral cost (shattered orchid, splintered chime), the Accumulative/Textural lens holding through sensory escalation to the final whisper of her name.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Opal library setting constrains every choice—the fragile glass-orchids dictate Liora's movements, and the bamboo chime's physicality forces the climax; "air smelled of ozone and foxglove regret" charges the final image with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Liora's agency: her match-lighting deepens the dominant conflict (preserving vs. awakening sounds), narrowing options to a single, costly act; the felt price—ruined library, unshakable echo—is unmistakable in "her hands empty, her heart full."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the shattered chime and "sunlight spilling into ruins" reject preservation as a non-literal answer to "museums of extinct feelings," avoiding moralizing while charging the final image with earned ambiguity about mourning versus awakening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is immaculate—"breath fogging cold air," "ink that whispered"—with rhythm modulating under stress (fragmented "The song stopped. The library exhaled"); no head-hopping, voice remains Liora's singular, biased lens throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "bitter, poisonous, beautiful" compresses theme, setting, and cost in one phrase. Only microscopic flaw: "too real" slightly abstracts the orchid's recoil, but rhythmic propulsion ("She struck a match") never falters even at peak tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes "museum of extinct feelings" with visceral library mechanics—bamboo tubes as vessels for lost language—to create fresh emotional truth; risk-taking (lyric structure, sensory overload climax) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
