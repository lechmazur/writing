<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lena's tech-vs-empathy tension ("not to fix alarms... but to add her own pulse"), with embodied cost when chest ache lifts. Sister backstory anchors flaw motivation without therapy-speak, though Elias' role as pressure source remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: Lena's red pulse reconfigures meaning with visceral cost ("chest didn’t ache"), under Accumulative/Textural lens. Density escalation from erratic sync to network participation feels inevitable, no causality breaks despite reflective shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mycelium setting constrains every choice—scanner cracks, pressure-reactive glow, permeable walls charge the final image. Sensory details ("damp, earthy quiet") filter through Lena's tech-bias, making environment inseparable from closure's "light through permeable wall" metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (failure of imagination in monitoring systems) tightens through Lena's active observation and red pulse choice. Cost is unmistakable in chest ache lifting, though secondary pressure from Elias could deepen escalation beyond his single line of dialogue.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment>Ending’s "doors that didn’t need opening" offers resonant, non-literal answer to letting go, reweighting mushrooms as "familiar strangers." Theme emerges through pressure-reactive mycelium and cracked scanner—no moralizing, just earned wisdom from Lena’s tactile engagement with the network.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("spatially gifted" sensing "unseen threads") shapes every description, with rhythm modulating from "breathing waves" to urgent "flickering like distress signal." Zero head-hopping; Elias' sparse dialogue carries subtext about silence vs. absence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold—sentences like "Perfect. She pressed the laser button" accelerate climax. Figurative language ("distress signal," "living circuit board") serves character POV without muddle, culminating in flawless final line propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "grieving specialist in nature" trope through mycelium-as-network specificity. Risk-taking (tech jargon meeting organic lyricism) heightens stakes, though "familiar strangers" concept edges toward recognizable metaphor without radical reinvention.</comment>
