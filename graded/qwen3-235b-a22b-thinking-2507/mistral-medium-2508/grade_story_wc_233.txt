<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "kingships for wishes, crowns for curses" but climax lacks micro-choice showing competing impulses during surrender; transformation feels slightly unearned despite strong embodied emotion ("pain was exquisite").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds perfectly; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost ("bones hummed with weight of stars"). Orientation clear by line 3, cost proof solid in transformation beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt stone and violet fireflies constrain choices (climbing, guiding) and charge final image; "smoldering veins" setting pressure shapes every tactic without generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven by queen's agency ("burned it without reply") tightens to irreversible trade-off; cost ("pain was exquisite") unmistakable and reweights dominance of "soul for truth" stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "memory was the kindest kind of bleeding" without moralizing; final image reweights premise as remembrance not hunger, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature strong ("cobalt stone," "violet fireflies") but "constellation given flesh" drifts into generic register at climax; rhythmic control under pressure otherwise exemplary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or muddle; "starlight pulsed brighter, painting her shadow... stretching it tall and hungry" achieves high density without sacrificing propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "forbidden grotto" trope via specific "violet fireflies" and emotional truth in "bargain struck in bloodless innocence"; risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
