<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elyas' "quietly driven" motivation is embodied through tactile shell-reading and decisive whistle use, though internal contradiction remains underdeveloped beyond fear/curiosity tension; the final walk earns endurance with crumbling whistle as visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through pattern-density escalation, but late establishment of "pattern languages" (midpoint) creates lens ambiguity; Earned Stasis closure lands with undeniable cost in the gate's scream and city's tremor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Turtle shells function as micro-setting that constrains every choice—from map-reading to the finale's groaning shift—charging the final image; sensory specificity falters slightly in underutilized non-visual details during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth about watchers) tightens through Elyas' agency when he plays the whistle, triggering the pivotal resonance; cost legibility suffers as the city's "trembling" feels abstract versus personal sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from shell-crack motifs to "asking as destination" closure; the gate's scream reweights the premise without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo while sustaining conceptual cost through visceral imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical precision ("iron teeth fused by time and salt") with pressure-appropriate compression, though "quietly driven" label momentarily disrupts embodied perception; psychic distance stays coherent during the resonance climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in phrases like "shadows stretched only toward the rusted gate" drives momentum, though "whisper of old languages rise" contains a minor subject-verb artifact that doesn't dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "lost expedition" trope through turtle-shell cartography mechanics; the "cracks as doors" synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking (lyric escalation) heightening stakes without obscuring the gate's scream payoff.</comment>
