<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "spine curved like a bridge" versus "patience as endless as the dark," with blood-seal action embodying her endurance. Final realization ("teaching it how to stay") earns closure through prior causality, though emotional layering slightly lacks friction between hope and despair.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost: "frost on her lashes melted" and "patience as endless as the dark" crystallize stakes. Accumulative lens holds perfectly through sensory density buildup, though "world ending or beginning" momentarily abstracts pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Withered orchard constrains every choice—apple husks for patterns, frostbitten soil for kneeling—and charges the final image (starlight "glow[ing] like embers under drifts"). Micro-setting (storybook plate) shapes the seal action, though "skeletal trees" verges on cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist’s agency: "hurry was the enemy of keeping" deepens the dominant conflict, with visible cost in her curved spine and blood-seal. "World ending" abstraction slightly dilutes concrete pressure, but escalation under Accumulative lens remains impeccable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "teaching light how to stay" reweights hope without moralizing. Final image (starlight under snow) resonates as non-literal answer to "how to preserve," avoiding sentimentality via "apple husks" and "cracked fingers" grounding the insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: alchemist notices "brittle pages" and "fractals of ice," not abstract concepts. Rhythmic control shifts from "breath curling like smoke" to urgent "nothing happened," though "frost on iron" slightly exceeds plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "each piece was a heartbeat" multiplies purpose (setting/character/theme). "Hold and remember" torn words propel momentum, though "skeletal trees" echoes "skeletal trees" weakly in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "last hope" trope through flash-paper alchemy’s physicality; "teaching light how to stay" synthesizes patience uniquely. Emotional specificity avoids cliché, but "subarctic crater" premise has faint echoes of apocalyptic archetypes.</comment>
