<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("edges sharp with weight") but micro-choices like pressing the bundle into steel crack earn credible endurance; emotional embodiment occasionally generalized (e.g., "fear warped time") though the ledger discovery's "shedding" action reveals hierarchy of values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: Daniel placing the label/ledger bundle into the steel crack while alleys rearrange forecloses his old identity with visceral cost (knee-deep flood crossing); Accumulative lens holds as fragment-layering intensifies to crystallize his stance without retroactive patches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Container labyrinth actively constrains choices (vanishing alleys, flood barriers) and charges closure ("water closed without ripple"); micro-setting of the label's physicality (creased, clutched talisman) directly shapes the final action and reweights erasure as gold in dawn light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Daniel's agency: collecting fragments evolves into offerings, then ledger discovery, culminating in the flood-crossing climax; cost is unmistakable (physical immersion, identity shedding), though the "figures moving" subplot slightly dilutes focus on the core erasure stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the label's transformation ("Do Not Ingest" → "some poisons meant to be absorbed"); final image of water closing without ripple offers resonant non-literal answer to erasure/rebirth without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite "erasure was real" reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("port city’s breath was salt and rust") with rhythmic control intensifying during flood ("waded through knee-deep water"); no head-hopping, and purposeful compression (e.g., "names of streets... slipping") taught early pays off in closure's lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "hummed against his palm like a secret" shows not tells, with zero loops or scaffold; only minor density risk in "thick and syrupy" fear description, but specificity ("syrupy") prevents muddle even in peak tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "erased man" trope through concrete port mechanics (tide-dependent alleys) and the poison label's evolving symbolism; risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightens stakes coherently, with "flooded lower paths" as fresh inflection growing from established setting logic.</comment>
