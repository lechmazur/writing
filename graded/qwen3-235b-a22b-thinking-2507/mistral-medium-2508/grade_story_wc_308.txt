<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in crisis; motivation clear but interiority remains resolute without visible struggle. Final choice earned yet cost feels abstract despite "becoming stone" stance. Micro-choices under pressure (e.g., turning arrowhead) show specificity but no internal conflict fracturing the resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost ("He was the stone. He was the echo") under Accumulative lens. Pressure deepens via sensory density shift (panic vibrations → deliberate echoes), but the cost's legibility wavers—survival hinges on stillness yet no tangible sacrifice dramatizes the price beyond stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bone towers and arrowhead function as micro-setting constraining choices: echoes guide navigation, stone's vibration becomes the anchor. Final image ("He was the stone") charges the environment with irreversible weight, satisfying 9+ gate through tangible object-as-setting pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through the lagging bird's anomaly, tightening options to stillness as the only survival tactic. Escalation driven by protagonist's agency (calling the pulse home) with unmistakable cost—the erosion of self into stone—reconfiguring "navigate without moving" from observation to sacrificial embodiment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of stillness-as-survival emerges through concrete actions (arrowhead vibrations, flock patterns), never stated. Final image ("He was the stone. He was the echo") offers resonant, non-literal answer to navigation's cost, reweighting ancestral practice as active endurance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful: vibration-centric POV filters all description ("feeling the vibrations like ripples"). Rhythmic control under pressure shifts from measured cadence to staccato tension ("He didn’t flinch. He was the stone."), with elision (off-screen predator) taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; propulsion through precise verbs ("slithered," "banked," "blotted"). Near-flawless density, though "ripple of wrongness" slightly abstracts peak tension. Final beats ("He was the stone. He was the echo") achieve crystalline clarity without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "last guardian" trope through vibrational navigation mechanics. Emotional truth in becoming the anchor—fresh synthesis of observation and sacrifice—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (quiet climax, no physical confrontation) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
