<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's contradictory impulses (profit vs. sentiment) drive choices under pressure; librarian's embodied "clutching overdue notices like a shield" reveals layered vulnerability. Final renunciation of ledger precision earns cost through prior causality—mother's bartering legacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis: "some debts weren’t meant to be collected" crystallizes stance with visible cost (ledger imbalance) under Accumulative lens. Locket’s journey from pocket to neck reconfigures meaning; cost proof: "tucked a new envelope" implies ongoing sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting object (locket) constrains choices: weights envelope, triggers recognition, hangs at closure. Salt-kissed breeze and overdue notices charge final image—environment shapes tactics without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (correcting "mix-ups") tightens through Elias’s agency: scribbling reply, pressing locket into her palm. Medical supplies plan narrows options, but cost feels implied rather than viscerally paid on-page during escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image ("smoke curl into stars") reweights theme through particulars: "spaces between notes" rejects transactional logic. Avoids moralizing despite near-miss with ledger line; locket’s journey embodies "cycles of compassion" without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature sharp: Elias notices "silver thread in hair," "wrought-iron railing." Dialogue indirection ("You’re the one who leaves oranges") reveals history through implication. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" near closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>Zero loops; "salt-kissed breeze" and "ferry horn" anchor rhythm. "Quiet hum of things finding their way" risks sentimentality but saved by concrete locket payoff. No artifacts dull closure—smoke/image fusion charges final beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cargo broker rerouting compassion via dock logistics. Specificity ("medical supplies to clinic") avoids genericity. Risk-taking (quiet Earned Stasis) heightens stakes, but "cautious exuberance" trope slightly tempers originality.</comment>
