<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices: tracing pen nib while stomach twists, then writing "orbit breaks here" with warm nib. Micro-choice to start new ledger reveals hierarchy (truth over safety). Journalist’s off-page pressure slightly underdeveloped as secondary pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: "orbit breaks here" reconfigures the metaphor while tea clink echoes typesetter’s hammer. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—ledgers to plates tighten options. Only hairline flaw: caretaker’s late entrance slightly disrupts causality flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Observatory functions as micro-setting: dome fogging mirrors obscured truth, acoustics enable plot (hearing caretaker), and pen constrains choice (writing the ledger line). Final stars recharging "indifferent witnesses" charges closure with environmental cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (bury vs publish truth) escalates through Lydia’s agency: ledger discovery tightens options, plates arrival forces intervention. Cost is visceral—stomach twist, "weight of what she carried"—culminating in tea clink as earned stasis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action, not statement: orbit metaphor evolves from abstract ("regret was an orbit") to actionable ("orbit breaks here"). Final image rejects moralizing—stars as "indifferent witnesses" while ink becomes tomorrow’s future.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: notices cufflink engraving, ledger grain, shadow length. Rhythm modulates perfectly—staccato for tension ("Her stomach twisted"), lyrical for reflection ("steam curling like comet trails"). Zero voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose near-flawless: "pristine columns" doing triple duty (setting, tension, character). Only microscopic slip: "pulse jumped" borders bodily cliché but redeemed by immediate action (descending stairs). Zero loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms investigative trope through intimate lens: observatory reframes truth-seeking as celestial navigation, orbit metaphor avoids platitude by being literally broken. Risk-taking (quiet climax) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
