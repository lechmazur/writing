<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority vividly concrete ("breath fogging glass," "pulse quickened") but lacks contradictory impulses; motivation remains monolithic ("collect textures") without deeper conflict beyond surface studiousness. Final choice to begin new sketch feels unearned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: lamp hum fading after Elara's story, stationer choosing "other histories to invent" with visible cost ("ink still wet with weight"). Accumulative lens holds—each texture layer tightens pressure toward crystallized stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bonsai forest constrains choice and charges closure: branches "swaying in response" to hum, shadows "stretching long across notepad," final glow making "forest seem to glow from within." Micro-setting (lamp hum, notepad) directly enables revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via hum's progression (vibration→name→life) but pressure lacks meaningful tightening—no active opposition or trade-off beyond passive reception. Cost ("weight of Elara’s forgotten afternoons") is felt but doesn’t alter tactics beyond emotional burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "textures of different times," crystallized by final image: "dead were patient, but their stories were not." Avoids moralizing; "refracting past through present" reweights time’s malleability without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("rustle of silk merchant’s sleeve," "grit of stonemason’s chisel") and rhythmic control peak in revelation sequence ("numbers formed patterns, then words, then a name"). No head-hopping; compression taught early pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("pen moved with incandescent restraint, each line a promise"). Minor register drift: "refracting the past through the present" slightly abstract in high-pressure beat. Final line ("the dead were patient...") achieves perfect propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of "invented histories" through sensory archaeology—transforming lamp hum into Elara’s life. Risk-taking (textural accumulation as plot) heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity ("1923 tin roof") avoids genericity.</comment>
