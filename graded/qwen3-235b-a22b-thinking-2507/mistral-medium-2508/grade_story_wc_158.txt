<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation "photosynthesize pain into beauty" drives micro-choices (palming ghost's sternum), but "shyly unstoppable" remains label-only without visible struggle against contradiction during key actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when shell seals around her; cost legible in "forgotten to title the manual" amid coral growth. Ghost's dissolution slightly undermines pressure escalation but doesn't break Accumulative lens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Shell functions as active micro-setting: its acoustics-bending niche enables the ghost's transformation, and calcium veins directly channel lullabies. Final coral growth in helmet charges closure with undeniable constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dissolving war through art) deepens via ghost confrontation, but his easy unraveling into "kelp and bioluminescent dust" slightly dilutes cost legibility. "Tasting salt and metallic tang" grounds escalation in visceral consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through coral in helmet—not moralizing. Near-miss: "joy was not absence of sorrow but its alchemy" risks thematic echo but avoids penalty via immediate reef imagery ("thriving in shadow of shipwrecks").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("reef-shadow joy"), but "veined with ink" and "calcium veins" risk mixed metaphor. Lyric compression taught early via shell's "spiraled walls" pays off cleanly in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Bones humming" and later "hum, the sound vibrating" create subtle synonym loop. Otherwise immaculate propulsion; "crushed violets and gunpowder turned to pollen" exemplifies high-density textural specificity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms war poetry tropes through biological precision (photosynthesis/coral). "Manual" conceit avoids gimmickry by being eaten and woven into net—fresh synthesis where removing coral buds would break closure's emotional charge.</comment>
