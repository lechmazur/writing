<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (rescue vs understanding sacred space) act simultaneously in climax; final choice earned through prior causality with visible cost in Elias’s hesitation and altered relationship dynamic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost ("air thicker, sweeter") and lens coherence; minor convenience in sinkhole discovery slightly softens causality but payoff is earned through terrace analysis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fireflies and corn husk boat constrain choices and charge final image; terrace’s "drifting prism" directly enables the sinkhole discovery, making environment indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias’s agency (grain analysis → sinkhole run); cost unmistakable in physical/emotional shift at candlelight ("wanted to scream... but air was different").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of refolding cornstalks offers resonant answer to "necessary distances" without moralizing; theme emerges from concrete actions (maze design vs true center).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("wind carried no trace of laughter") and rhythmic control peak in climax; elision (Liora’s disappearance) taught early and paid off via logbook.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("featherly determined" reprises with thematic weight); "fractured hush" avoids cliché while advancing pressure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corn maze as metaphor for sacred thresholds; specificity (BFE-7 code, chair-leg ladder) transforms familiar tropes into inevitable emotional truth.</comment>
