<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias' "respectfully rebellious" micro-choices (e.g., tilting the bottle despite drone risk), but Lira's abrupt disappearance lacks causal setup, slightly undermining the relationship crucible. Scarred wrist and lighter satchel embody cost, yet emotional layering falters in the alley scene where "chest ached" leans abstract over embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "Some borders weren’t meant to hold... he’d deliver again" crystallizes stance with visible cost (scar, ongoing drone threat). Orientation flawless by line 3 ("disputed strip... pavement beneath his boots"), but transition to post office feels slightly abrupt, losing 0.2 under Accumulative lens where density should deepen.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Disputed strip and bottle function as micro-settings that charge the final image ("absences linked like constellations"), but the cobalt arcade remains atmospheric backdrop rather than pressuring tactics—e.g., no use of arcade mechanics during drone evasion. Misses Q3 9+ gate as environment doesn't constrain choices, only frames them.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten credibly through Elias' agency (running to post office as drones close in), with scar and satchel weight as felt cost. But "haunted by letters" revelation feels coincidental rather than earned escalation under Accumulative lens, losing 0.3 for one escalation flaw that doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly through the storm bottle's function: "shows you where the cracks had been" reweights brokenness without moralizing. Final image ("absences linked like constellations") delivers resonant non-literal answer to "where promises broke," avoiding all anti-patterns like thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias' voice is distinct ("respectfully rebellious" lexicon, postal rhythm), but Lira's dialogue lacks differentiation—her "You're late" could belong to any weary sidekick. Perceptual signature strong ("twilight bled violet"), though minor register drift in "conceptual cost" phrasing slightly undermines POV modesty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "storm didn’t escape—it *unfolded*" exemplifies rhythmic propulsion. One borderline-purple phrase ("air tasted like the moment before an apology") risks overwriting but pays off emotionally in context—no closure artifacts. Meets 9+ test with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms border-politics trope via "thunderstorm in a bottle" as emotional reckoning tool—plot fails with generic "magic object." Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes, and "disputed strip" specificity anchors universals. Transformation test passed: emotional calculus hinges on Elias' postal identity.</comment>
