<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in chronicler's silence versus decisive cicada handoff, but fisherman lacks depth beyond grief symbol. "World holds its breath" risks thematic echo near moralizing. Micro-choice of pressing cicada into palm earns closure with tactile cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: fisherman's dawn departure crystallizes altered rhythm with grief's "texture." Orientation clear by line 3. Minor flaw: "texture of time" insight leans reflective over action-driven escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grotto's water drip constrains chronicler's meditation rhythm; tidal pool charges final hermit crab image. Jade cicada functions as micro-setting, altering tactics when pressed into fisherman's hand. Avoids postcard description through embodied pressure on choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief's texture) tightens through chronicler's observation of ripple fade, narrowing options to silent transmission. Cost felt in "cloth worn thin" image. Escalation slightly passive—relies on insight rather than agency-driven pressure shift under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final hermit crab's "hairline crack" reweights grief without stating theme. Avoids moralizing; "quiet in between" gains resonance through cicada handling. No abstract assertions—texture motif charges closure with conceptual cost of softening stone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "crab sidles toward prey" reveals chronicler's observational bias. Rhythmic control in "drip/strike/ripple" sequence deepens pressure. Minor register drift in "truth too vast for shape of his question" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "ripple expand, then fade" shows efficient propulsion. "Humming potential like air before storm" slightly clichéd but redeemed by context. Final line "textures linger" avoids sentimentality through concrete damp sleeve detail.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope via tidal pool metaphors: "texture" as non-obvious angle, hermit crab's cracked shell reprises cicada's weight. Avoids safety middle with "grief softens like stone worn by tide"—specific, verifiable detail over generic comfort.</comment>
