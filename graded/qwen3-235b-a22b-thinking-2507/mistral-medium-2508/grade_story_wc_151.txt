<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lena's dual role as preserver (arcade keeper) and eraser (name creator), with embodied micro-choices like testing "Mizuho" aloud and the sleeve-wipe erasure revealing her values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise via the mailbox "thunk" and chalk erasure, crystallizing her marginal existence with conceptual cost; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density buildup to the final image's reconfiguration of meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The arcade's neon ghosts and frayed envelope constrain choices (chalk message location, analog security), charging the final image where "gold trim" glare mirrors her preference for edges, making setting inseparable from thematic closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lena's manual code tweak for "Mizuho," narrowing options to analog transmission; the felt cost—irreversible mailing and erased chalk—reweights her marginal existence under Accumulative pressure without overt antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Meaning was the one thing you couldn't encrypt" resonates as non-literal answer to identity's fragility, earned through prior particulars like bleeding ink and fading chalk without moralizing; complexity avoids false equivalence in escape ethics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "neon ghosts flickering like half-remembered dreams" and "candy wrapper skittering," with rhythmic control shifting from lyrical dawn to urgent mailing; no head-hopping despite deep POV immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; "thunk... like a secret kept" demonstrates high-density propulsion, though "binary and dust" slightly overwrites but avoids muddling closure; strategic telling compresses backstory efficiently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "identity escape" trope through tactile specifics (chalk grit, rice paper bleed), with fresh synthesis in analog/digital tension; risk-taking (surface mail in futuristic setting) heightens stakes coherently without gimmickry.</comment>
