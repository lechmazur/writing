<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines as Liora’s desire for respite clashes with her refusal to take ("didn’t ask what you’d get in return"), embodied through soil-touching micro-choices. Kael’s altruism avoids saintliness via flickering form and deferred release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "universe breathed back" crystallizes nebula as collective effort with cost of war memories. "We stay" reweights Kael’s chalk messages, fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens through density shift at watering bell strike.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Orchard planet constrains every choice—the watering bell’s brass surface etched with names directly charges the final image. "Soil remembered war" transforms setting from backdrop to active constraint on healing tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation via Liora’s "reexamine the cracks" action narrows options from individual respite to collective burden, with cost legible in how "earth still hummed with old explosions." Pressure tightens through fruit’s sweetness and butterfly garden’s evolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges through "nebula" reconfiguration: "not a place to escape to, but a place to build." Final "We stay" offers non-literal answer without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo by rooting wisdom in soil-touching actions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "fruit pulsed with starlight" and "wings shimmered like shattered moons" reflects Liora’s exhaustion-turned-hope. Rhythmic control under pressure shown in clipped dialogue ("You’re early") contrasting lyrical interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sound didn’t travel outward—it unfolded" demonstrates high density with propulsion. Minor overwriting in "ripe enough to split the sky" slightly dilutes momentum but doesn’t obscure closure’s cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "altruistic ghost" trope through Kael’s embodied limitation (flickering form) and refusal to move on. "Brambled hope" tone sustains via specific details like oil-stained mechanic teaching children, avoiding generic optimism.</comment>
