<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied ("longing steely as a blade unsheathed"), but "ghost of what could have been" edges toward abstraction. Final renunciation of waiting earned by compasses stilling with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: pressure tightens through compasses locking and clock's pendulum swinging. Charged Poise closure lands with undeniable cost (years of silence broken), though film-path mechanics lack causal grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting (anniversary clock) constrains choice (winding ritual) and charges final image (pendulum swinging true). "Ozone and old paper" weakens specificity, but piano's wake-like notes deepen emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through Lena's agency—threading the reel, playing toward the path. Cost is visceral (compasses pointing inward), though the refuge's emergence relies slightly on environmental convenience rather than pure choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through charged objects (clock, film), not abstraction. Final image reweights "surprise fate" as mutual endurance without moralizing, though "horizon swallowing sun" risks cliché resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("wind hummed like half-remembered tune"), but "melodies as if it still owed her" overwrites tension. Rhythm modulates perfectly with arbor's groans and piano's wake.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor synonym loop ("coaxed melodies... as if it still owed her" followed by "wound it every dawn"). Final line's propulsion ("wind carried it forward") avoids closure artifacts, but "grainy images" slightly dilutes density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: film reel as refuge blueprint transforms reunion tropes. Risk-taking (lyric compression) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "tidal arbor above clouds" borrows familiar fantasy lexicon.</comment>
