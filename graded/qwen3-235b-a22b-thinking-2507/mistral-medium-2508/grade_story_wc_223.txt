<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora's crisis actor past grounds her historian role, but interiority occasionally drifts into thematic abstraction ("You want to be remembered"). Contradictory impulses shine when she laughs "raw and bright" amid danger, though motivation for "unbinding" lacks deeper embodiment beyond the central conceit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: silence becomes the weapon against the penumbra, with visceral cost in the splintering chessboard and biting bishop. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly through the final image of rising wings reweighting all "small gestures" as resistance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The whispering gallery functions as active constraint—dust patterns dictate her walking incantations, the warped chessboard's physicality enables the climax. Sensory details serve pressure: "smelled of rain on hot pavement" directly charges the final image of unmoored moments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation builds through Accumulative density: whispers rising to "chorus of recognition," penumbra recoiling from "spaces between stories." Cost is clear in the splintering board, but the interregnum timeframe remains atmospheric rather than a tactical clock tightening decisions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: etching questions in dust, pressing the bishop until it "bit." The final wings of unmoored moments answer "What remains?" without moralizing, transforming silence from void to weapon with undeniable conceptual cost against the penumbra's hunger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice modulates masterfully under pressure—short, urgent sentences during the penumbra's lunge ("Liora was already moving") versus lyrical flow in closure. Slight intrusion in "benevolently ruthless thing" disrupts focalization, but perceptual signature ("collecting the unnoticed") remains fiercely consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "splintered into wings—dozens of them, fragile as moths" merges action and image without scaffolding. Minor explanatory slip ("The penumbra had no form, but it had hunger") in high-pressure beat, but zero loops or figurative muddle near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms apocalypse tropes memorably: pawns "unbound" rather than captured, silence as resistance. "Historian of small gestures" reframes survival through micro-resistance, though faint Borgesian echoes in the gallery slightly dilute freshness despite strong execution.</comment>
