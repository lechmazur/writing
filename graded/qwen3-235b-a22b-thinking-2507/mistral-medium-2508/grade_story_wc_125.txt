<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "ethically playful" nature versus the rope's profound resonance; embodied cost in "hands burned... frayed ends now smooth, now *alive*" earns the ladder's creation. Slight abstraction in "texture of time" motivation prevents 9.0 despite strong micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: ladder "waiting for the next impossible choice" crystallizes options with undeniable cost (burned hands, altered rope). Orientation anchors by para 2 ("terra-cotta grotto"), and Accumulative lens holds through resonant rope snap—no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rope functions as essential micro-setting, constraining choice (tying to stalactite, carving rungs) and charging closure (luminous ladder casting shadows). Grotto itself remains atmospheric backdrop; "damp clay scent" filters through poet's POV but lacks tactical constraint for 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via protagonist agency: rope unwinding layers ("knot tied by desperate hands") tightens escape/surrender binary until "resonance" snap. Cost is visceral (burned hands) and conceptual ("shape of the question"), but "texture of time" motivation needs earlier concrete friction to reach 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: ladder as "frayed and luminous thing" reweights "impossible choices" without moralizing. Final line "Only the texture of time, unspooling" resonates non-literally, avoiding anti-patterns—no thematic echo, only earned complexity in the beings' silent artistry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("boots worn thin by highways," "scent of damp clay") modulates rhythm under pressure: short syntax for rope snap ("He chose the latter"), lyrical flow for starlight. Minor register drift in "ethically playful" label prevents 9.0, but voice remains cohesive and pressure-responsive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "rope snapped, but not from force—from *resonance*." Metaphors coherent ("constellations rearranged like oil on water"), climax avoids figurative muddle. Near-flawless propulsion—only "sins too heavy to hold" slightly generic, but no closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms tropes: energy beings as "currency" for impossible choices, ladder replacing noose. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable ("best patterns were the ones you had to climb to see") with risk-taking (lyric structure) heightening stakes without gimmickry—no safety hedging in moral ambiguity.</comment>
