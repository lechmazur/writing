<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices: fever-scoured clarity versus trembling hands, smudging the illustration then placing it exposed. Final renunciation of voice—stepping into storm—earns cost via prior causality (barometer dip, ozone scent). No diagnostic labels; contradiction acts simultaneously in key beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: Liora’s vanishing footprints crystallize the cost of swallowed truth with undeniable conceptual weight. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure tightens via sensory density (ozone smell, barometer dip) without causal turns. Cost legible in "the station would take it with it" and ledgers recording inevitability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting (botanical illustration) constrains choice and charges closure: smudged petals become "wings" when placed on the table, directly enabling her renunciation. Frost-laced window, barometer, and ravens evolve with pressure, mirroring internal state through tactile detail ("paper soft as a pulse").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via protagonist agency: Liora’s shift from static uncertainty ("slow unraveling") to visceral certainty ("storm breaks *now*") narrows options to silence or warning. Cost is the station’s destruction and her life, made legible in "it would take the station with it" and vanishing footprints under aurora’s glow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: smudged illustration reweights truth as blurred poison, "margins" as breathing space. Final image—"some truths meant to be swallowed whole"—resonates without moralizing. Avoids Thematic Echo; complexity lingers in ravens taking flight as oracle vanishes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is singular: Liora notices barometer wavers, ice shearing, ledger margins. Rhythmic control peaks in climax ("let the wind fill her lungs, her mouth, her silence"). Zero filter verbs; stress compresses diction ("perilously so") while sustaining voice. Auroral sorrow modulates to decisive action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ozone and old blood" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Figurative language serves pressure ("groaning iron ribs," "static and copper taste"). Final paragraph’s cadence—"ravens took flight... wings black against aurora’s sorrowful glow"—avoids muddle while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms oracle trope through specific constraints: "fault-tolerance" as suppressed tremors, truth as *Aconitum* poison. Emotional specificity in "weight in ribs dissolved like salt in water" avoids genericity. Risk-taking (silence as climax) heightens stakes without gimmickry; premise feels inevitable.</comment>
