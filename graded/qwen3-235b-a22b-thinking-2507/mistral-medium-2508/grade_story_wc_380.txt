<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (seeking/destroying memory) drive Earned Stasis; pocket-emptying shows visceral cost. "Her laugh dissolving mid-chuckle" embodies grief without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: "gravity is always hungry" crystallizes irreversible cost after stone disintegration. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through coffee/wildflower pattern reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Salt chamber constrains every choice; whale bones' disappearance charges final image. "Air tasted like ozone and old pennies" exemplifies sensory hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stake tightening via gravity's physical cost (stone dissolution/ash flowers); "pockets of gravity yawning wide" deepens knowledge with visceral trade-off. Agency drives escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image reweights "stored" memories as predatory force without moralizing. "Some things weren't meant to be found" resonates through salt chamber mechanics, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("brass hook clicking," "crusty hinges") filters all detail. Syntax compresses under stress: "The weight in his pocket *shifted*." No POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "tearing paper" sound metaphor integrates physics with emotion. Minor overwriting: "thick as mud" coffee cliché. Final line’s rhythm variation powers closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: memory as excavatable matter via gravity physics. Whale/beached bones recontextualizes memory loss as systemic predation, not personal failure.</comment>
