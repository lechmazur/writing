<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Liora’s embodied motivation (“dug her nails until fingers bled”) and contradictory impulses (terror vs. persistence) power the climax; minor deduction for near-final thematic echo (“work was not hers alone”) slightly over-articulating the earned shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: “it was her. And now, at last, she was being released” crystallizes cost while villagers’ arrival reconfigures stakes; Accumulative lens holds from first sensory pressure to final harmony.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Mica windows function as micro-setting—constraining choice (touching bark), charging closure (shattering from fulfillment); “light seeped through fissures, pale and trembling” exemplifies sensory selection mirroring internal urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes viscerally tighten via Liora’s escalating physical cost (burning throat, bleeding fingers) under Accumulative lens; the returned harmony reversal feels earned by her agency, not coincidence, with “it was her” crystallizing the felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: “knitting, the binding” of community reweights in villagers joining voices; final image (“weaving would never stop”) resonates without moralizing, avoiding sentimentality through earned cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (“fragments of light like half-remembered dreams”) modulates under pressure; lyric compression (“The trees leaned in, hungry”) teaches its pattern early and pays off in closure’s rhythmic release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: “light seeped through the fissures, pale and trembling” multiplies atmosphere and stakes; minor deduction for “dull as an ember smothered in ash” (redundant smothering) in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of “alchemical trees” with mica-light shards avoids trope; emotional specificity (“baker who’d fed strangers”) grounds universals, though mirror-world premise edges close to familiar archetypes without transformative risk.</comment>
