<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's contradictory impulses (patience vs. recklessness) act simultaneously in the piano trap scene; her final scattering of seeds earns closure through six years of cell-bound causality. Minor abstraction in "chained liberator" label slightly dilutes early tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "the wall was already forgotten" crystallizes options with visible cost ("pockets empty, hands stained"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds through symbol density, with arrow notches tightening tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Carnival micro-setting constrains choices (piano trap, duck-pond pit) and charges closure—arrow fletching in belt reweights strategy/recklessness. "Ivory keys yellowed like old bones" exemplifies tactile specificity shaping action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by Lena's agency: arrow notch sequence ("impede, then proceed") narrows options to reverse key order. Guard confrontation forces tactical shift with immediate cost (empty pockets, fading shouts).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars—scattered seeds and poppy trap—not moralizing. Final image ("shadow stretching long over soil armed with life") reweights resilience as quiet persistence, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature sharp ("fogging breath," "yellowed keys") with rhythmic control: short sentences for tension ("Lena didn’t run"), lyrical cadence at closure. Stress compresses diction without voice leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; every line propels plot ("snapped arrow’s shaft revealing notches"). Figurative language sparse but potent ("soil armed with life"); closure image undulled by artifacts. High density without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: carnival as functional micro-setting (not trope), "impede then proceed" innovating puzzle mechanics. Risk-taking in quiet climax (planting seeds > wall collapse) heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
