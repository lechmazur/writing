<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "He wasn’t a hero. He was a man who listened too closely," but the glove-touch micro-choice arrives late; cost of curiosity isn’t embodied until climax, missing earlier pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "He answered" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (carrying both photograph and glove). Orientation anchors instantly; Hybrid lens (Accumulative dominant at closure) holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—it screams when glove is touched, forcing Elias’s kneeling endurance. The hearing aid’s physicality charges the final image, meeting 9+ gate by altering tactics through tool degradation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding her before mist takes her) tightens via glove discovery, narrowing options to touch/endure. Cost is legible in Elias’s physical collapse and new dual role, but mist’s agency slightly softens protagonist-driven escalation at peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "witnesses" motif: final image of Elias answering the whisper reweights "listening" without moralizing. "For when you forget" on photograph offers non-literal answer to memory’s cost, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in tactile/auditory focus ("wires frayed but warm," "breath fogging the mic"). Rhythmic control under pressure ("The mist *screamed*—not a sound, but a pressure") with elision taught via static patterns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in reflection paragraph ("Curiosity had always been his undoing...") slightly dulls momentum. Zero figurative muddle in peak beats, but "pennies left on a corpse’s eyes" risks overwriting without payoff in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "incidental heroism" through specific synthesis: contact tracer’s skill repurposed for dead, with hearing aid mechanics grounding supernatural. Risk-taking (dead as clients) heightens stakes without gimmickry; fresh inflection feels inevitable.</comment>
