<question>1</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (sea exile vs. cosmic verse) manifest in embodied choices like trembling fingers and blood-ink ritual; final transformation earned through prior causality with visible cost in "skin was no longer hers alone." No diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost ("a map. A confession.") under Accumulative/Textural lens; density escalation through ritual intensification reweights exile's meaning. Cost proof evident in "fragile thing... perfectly, terribly free."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Twilight garden actively constrains choices: blackened pond supplies Orion's reflection for verse, waterlilies' sharp edges foreshadow blood-ink. Final image charged by "garden held its breath" reconfiguring the setting's pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: observing gaps becomes ritual prerequisite, dust's hunger narrows options to blood-ink sacrifice. Cost unmistakable in transformed skin and "sea would rise without her" resignation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete ritual: "exile was just another word for a door left ajar" reweights premise without moralizing. Final image ("ink shimmered, alive") offers resonant answer to belonging through cosmic verse's fragility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("waterlilies curled like clenched fists") and rhythmic control under pressure; lyrical compression taught early ("blade unsheathed") pays off in closure's cadence shifts. No head-hopping, voice modulates with ritual intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion ("dust bit deep... as if waiting since first tide"). Minor figurative muddle in "pulse could carry words like current" avoids peak-beat disruption. Closure lines shimmer with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of exile-as-transformation through tide dancer's blood-ink ritual; "door left ajar" reconfiguration grows from prior particulars. Risk-taking (cosmic verse as skin-map) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
