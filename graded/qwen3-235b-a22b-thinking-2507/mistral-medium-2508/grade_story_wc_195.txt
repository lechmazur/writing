<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (silence vs. oath-keeping) act simultaneously in the gauntlet-unsnapping moment; the earned smile's "holy fire" cost crystallizes seven years of internal fracture without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("hurt like holy fire") under Accumulative/Textural lens; the greenhouse-to-stage reconfiguration makes allegiance's conceptual shift undeniable through threads rewoven as wings.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard constrains every choice: condensation-wept glass forces introspection, unfolding plants trigger oath-memory, and the dissolving program becomes the key; environment charges the final image by revealing the stage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven by knight's agency—thread-tightening pressure forces the unsnap choice, narrowing options from silence to speech with felt cost (holy fire pain) that reconfigures the dominant stake: allegiance to possibility's shape.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><comment>Theme emerges through "threads as wings" reconfiguration: the final image rejects silence-as-allegiance without moralizing, making "the shape after" resonate through spilled shadows and mending sky as earned complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "metal whispering" and "petals pulsing with a light that wasn’t light"; rhythmic control under pressure ("*Unsnap.*") teaches patterned elision early, paid off in the stage's crystalline closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "shadows—thin, eager things" compresses metaphor without muddle; final line "The audience? The dark itself." achieves textural specificity with propulsion, no figurative clutter in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synthesizes knight tropes through "alchemical orchard" specificity: the unsnap action transforms silence from flaw to invitation, avoiding safety-middle via risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
