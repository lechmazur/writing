<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("sold his name to the wind" vs. prophetic necessity) drives final choice; embodied emotion in shaking hands and fogged glass. Flaw: backstory fragments lack micro-choice anchoring per BRR policy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise RR lands with conceptual cost ("bruised purple dawn" reweights "dawn as knife" premise). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via patterned escalation: static → wails → silence → light. Cost proof: "city in sketches began to rise" shows irreversible change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt portico constrains all choices (sealing crack, hurling receiver) and charges final image ("glass touched back"). Sensory specificity ("ozone and forgotten things") filters through Elias' radio-tech lens. Micro-setting mastery: tool (soldering iron) enables pivotal action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dawn as knife vs. scalpel) tightens via Elias' agency: sealing portico forecloses passive path. Cost crystallized in "silence worse than static" and risen city. Pressure accumulates through sensory density (static → wails → silence) per Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "prophets assembled from scraps" reweights to "hand" via portico confrontation. Final image ("scalpel" dawn) offers non-literal answer to "knife" premise without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by embedding insight in city's physical rise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: radio-static diction ("hissed and spat fragments") modulates under stress. Purposeful compression taught early ("storm didn’t howl—it whispered") pays off in climax. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance tightens as pressure mounts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; high density ("static hum through the bones of the observatory" links to "ribs of mountain"). Final beat ("unfolded hands, future unfolded") avoids figurative muddle. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" near-closure risks academic tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: prophets as "assembled" from radio static reframes divine calling through tech. Emotional truth in "doubt" vs. "certainty" reflection. Bold risk: storm as "crown" transforms cliché while charging closure. Avoids derivative "chosen one" tropes via cobalt glass mechanics.</comment>
