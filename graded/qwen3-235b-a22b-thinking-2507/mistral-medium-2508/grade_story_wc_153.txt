<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied in micro-choices (shard press, evoked words) avoids therapy-speak; crumpled letter as tangible manifestation of conflict. Final release earned by prior causality with visible cost ("wounds didn’t need to heal to stop hurting").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options with undeniable cost: letter release forecloses silence with "touch as light as forgiveness." Accumulative lens holds through density shift in condensation evocation. Cost legible in "the letter in her pocket stayed crumpled" until release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Mangroves actively constrain choices (roots tangle ankles) and charge final image ("mangroves kept their secrets. But Liora didn’t"). Shard functions as micro-setting enabling the pivotal palm-press. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—crisp condensation details amid high stress.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through deepening: spirits’ question forces agency shift from hesitation to release. Cost crystallized in "wounds didn’t need to heal to stop hurting" as conceptual price for closure. Accumulative escalation reweights "river between us" from metaphor to lived reality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through condensation mechanics ("some letters didn’t need to be sent to be heard"), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights opening’s "river between us" into earned ambiguity without resolution. No thematic echo—insights arise from tangible actions like letter release.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "mangroves breathed in salt and exhaled mist," filtering setting through medium’s lens. Rhythmic control under pressure: fragmented evocations ("*I miss you. I was wrong. Stay.*") mirror emotional rupture. Zero POV leakage despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "paper soft as a pulse" exemplifies textural specificity. Final line recharges opening’s "mangroves breathed" with "so was she," avoiding closure muddle. Minor abstraction ("regret, maybe") redeemed by immediate sensory grounding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms "unsent letter" trope through condensation mechanics and mangrove pressure. Fresh inflection in using silence as active antagonist ("river between us isn’t water but silence"). Avoids sentimentality via tangible cost—letter release without guaranteed reconciliation.</comment>
