<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (order vs chaos) drive every micro-choice; the foundation chip press into wet paint crystallizes earned commitment with visceral cost. Jax's underdevelopment prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "the city was learning to move before walls could close in" with the bobbing raft as undeniable cost. Accumulative lens holds from "drunken dream" opening through escalating density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The foundation chip (micro-setting) constrains choices—burning in pocket, pressed into mural—and charges the final image. Raft city's draining waterways actively pressure tactics, not postcard backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through deepening: mural evolves from warning to "foundation," with the drifting raft as felt cost. Agency remains Elira’s reorganization tactic, narrowing options toward the clocktower act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "mainland taught walls; Lumina taught bridges." Final line "there was still time" reweights duality without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines—"acrid tang of frying dough," not just sights. Under stress, syntax compresses ("She grinned"), while lyric density ("lights reflecting like scattered promises") teaches and pays off the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "swirling lines encoding messages only intuitive could decipher" does triple duty (setting/conflict/theme). Final paragraph’s accelerating rhythm ("painted faster... building a third") fuels propulsion without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms gentrification trope via specific mechanics: graffiti as reorganization tool, foundation chip as reclaimed symbol. Risk-taking (accumulative pressure over confrontation) heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
