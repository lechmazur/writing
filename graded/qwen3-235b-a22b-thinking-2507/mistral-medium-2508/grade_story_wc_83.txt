<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lena's contradictory impulses—survivor numbness versus active hunting of possibility—manifest concretely in her micro-choices (tracing geode, ignoring warnings). Final renunciation of "fixing" the past for "remembering the edge" earns its cost through three-week journey details, avoiding epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the white screen shift to wedding tent crystallizes her stance with conceptual cost (observatory dark, storm indifferent). Causal linkage holds—geode frequency input directly enables pulling the operator's-choice thread—proving cost via "collapse the field" warning made real.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Geode functions as micro-setting that constrains choices: must place it on console during breaker cooldown, its warmth/hum dictating timing. Final image—cold geode in pocket as she steps into dark—charges closure by reweighting "unused time" from souvenir to tool of awakening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Lena selects the operator's choice moment over wedding/survival, narrowing options to one thread. Agency drives escalation: her refusal of warnings ("warnings were for people who believed in consequences") forces the cost—observatory collapse—felt in the sudden dark and indifferent storm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reconfiguration: "awakening" shifts from father's sketch to Lena's active hunt, culminating in the resonant final line "stepped into the dark, hunting." Avoids moralizing by making "unused time" tangible via geode mechanics and the drone's hesitation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in stress-distorted details: "veil floated upward... intangibly tangible" reframes trauma through precise physics. Rhythm accelerates during action ("The screen went white. Then—") while maintaining Lena's geological bias ("fractured planes refracting lights into something almost holy").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels tension. "Perturbation theory wasn't just math—it was a knife" exemplifies high-density phrasing that advances plot and theme without muddle. Final image ("storm raged on, indifferent") avoids closure-beat overwriting while charging cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel tropes through geological specificity: "unused time" as crystalline potential pools in decision moments, not events. Emotional truth lies in Lena hunting the operator's hesitation—not the wedding—making the premise irreplaceable via her survivor psychology.</comment>
