<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority excels in embodied glass-artist perception ("brittle patterns like forgotten script"), but brother's revelation lacks prior motivation groundwork; "steadily adaptive" trait surfaces too late to inform earlier choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation debt past 120 words ("three nights ago" arrives late) triggers -0.4 penalty; closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with ledger drop ("lighter than years") but disorientation slightly obscures early spatial stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frost patterns function as micro-setting constraint that charges the final image ("path written in frost"); canyon walls' narrowing to "slit of predawn light" actively pressures Liora's direction with tangible spatial consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation through ledger discovery deepens the dominant stake (purpose after trauma), but brother's handwriting reveal relies on coincidence rather than earned causality; cost ("ash in lungs") is visceral yet the twist weakens agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>"Truth, like glass, is clearer when broken" earns resonance through concrete action (dropping ledger), not abstraction; final "pauses" reprise avoids moralizing while reweighting the central question of meaning in absence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("frost, a language of absence") with rhythmic compression during realization ("She knew that handwriting"); minor POV slip in "canyon had always been quiet" slightly breaches character-bound knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>"Molten tears" risks overwriting cliché in high-pressure beat but redeemed by purposeful pattern; zero loops/scaffold with masterful propulsion ("She let the strip fall. It landed soundlessly") charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "searching for lost family" trope via glass/frost metaphors, but "purpose in pauses" borders on abstraction; saved by concrete execution where frost patterns literally become the path.</comment>
