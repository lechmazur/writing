<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena's contradictory impulses (translator vs grafter) drive micro-choices under pressure; "shrewdly innocent" trait manifests concretely in decrying crayon smudges as "dialect of grief." Final endurance earns cost via "ribs singing" as she walks toward wounds.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise under Accumulative lens: coral's weight in boy's pocket and glowing cast reconfigure meaning with undeniable cost ("ribs singing"). Lens clarity established early via "unknotting fear like a cipher" with pressure accumulating through object interactions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Brain coral constrains choices (grounds Lena during translation, given to boy) and charges final image ("first true sentence"). Mist-at-twilght setting pressures action via "cool as memory" tactile cues that mirror emotional states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stake (translating trauma) tightens through Lena's agency: coral handling evolves from self-grounding to gifting, narrowing options as she walks toward "other broken things." Cost legible in "knuckles white" and physical sacrifice ("ribs singing").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through coral/cast objects: "stitching new meaning into ruptures" crystallizes into final image where smudges "glow like embers." Avoids moralizing; "sea remembers shore" reweights grief as active remembrance without stated thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("pain could be translated... shape of it, weight") with rhythmic control under pressure. Elision taught early ("salvaged from wreckage... mortar fire stuttered") pays off in closure's lyrical compression without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; "bruise of violet and gold" to "smudges glow like embers" shows purposeful metaphor progression. Slight density risk in "labyrinthine grooves mirroring archways" but payoff in closure justifies accumulation without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms translator trope via tactile decryption method ("trace negative space" like landmines). Coral as "grafting" tool creates fresh synthesis where object physics (ridges) embodies emotional truth, avoiding symbolic convenience.</comment>
