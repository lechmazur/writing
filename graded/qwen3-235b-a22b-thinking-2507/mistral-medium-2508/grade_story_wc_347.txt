<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (refusing pleas yet helping girl) is concrete, but "offhandedly exact" trait lacks embodied cost escalation; final choice lacks visible struggle beyond the single decision beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (frozen birds mirroring frozen purpose), but the Accumulative lens stumbles: girl’s arrival doesn’t tighten tactics—Liora repeats her usual nut ritual without altered stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting (nut) charges final image, but mechanical birds feel ornamental; their patrol patterns don’t constrain choices beyond early exposition, weakening cliffside pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (duty vs compassion) is clear, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening; the girl’s arrival doesn’t narrow options—Liora’s action remains unchanged, muting trade-off cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "impressions" motif reweighting at closure ("labyrinth would remember"), avoiding moralizing; "graceless beauty" tone lingers without false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frost’s silver fingers," "fruit glistened like oil on water") and rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping, elision taught early via blueprint discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; minor paraphrase loop ("pressing... just hard enough to leave a mark/impression") in nut description avoids closure impact but limits 9+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of labyrinth myth with mechanical decay; "nuts as impressions" concept feels inevitable, risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
