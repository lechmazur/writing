<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (scientific precision vs poetic preservation) drive micro-choices like sealing the note with fresh mortar, crystallizing his commitment with visible cost: "his wife... left him for the sharp clarity of a life without ghosts." No stock phrasing; embodied emotion in "taste of salt" dream.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise under Accumulative/Textural lens: "the city would keep building, but he would be its archaeologist..." crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (isolation for preservation). Orientation clear by line 30; cost legible in "cracks would remember. And so would he."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion functions as micro-setting: water pressure constrains movement ("boots sinking into silt"), while the inkwell charges the final image when traded for the ledger. Sensory details ("rust and old paper") evolve causally with plot, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving hidden histories) tightens through Elias's deepening connection to the Keeper, narrowing options to commitment with felt cost (lost marriage). Agency-driven under Accumulative lens; the carp/shadow moment intensifies pressure without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "interlaced absence" reweights from decay to power, culminating in the non-literal answer "archaeologist of abandoned dreams." No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether preservation is redemption or compulsion, charged by the inkwell's final trade.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: surveyor’s precision ("measured erosion... grief of a poet") filters observations. Rhythmic control shifts from measured prose during work to fragmented urgency at "shadow moved," with patterned elision (dream/library transition) taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "drew a waterproof sleeve... nib dipped into inkwell’s last dregs" compresses action without scaffold. Zero figurative muddle in peak beats; minor rhythm repetition ("water lapped... water pressing") serves Accumulative density without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surveyor trope through specific details (Persian aunt’s dried violet ink, "cracks that ache"). Transforms "keeper of history" cliché via tactile constraints (waders, silt), with emotional truth in choosing ghosts over normalcy. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
