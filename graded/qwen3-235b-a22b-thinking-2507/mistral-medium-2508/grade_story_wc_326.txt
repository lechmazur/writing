<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lena’s porcelain shard ritual (fear/acceptance), but single-character scope limits relationship crucible. Micro-choices like syncing heartbeat with ink patterns reveal values under pressure without therapy-speak. Final endurance of identity erosion earns closure with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: snowflakes "finally whole" reconfigures static’s meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation clear by line 3 (opal observatory/snow/death certificate). Accumulative lens holds through ink pattern density shifts, though "defragment" action lacks tactical friction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Porcelain shard functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (edge "no longer sharp"), but opal observatory remains atmospheric backdrop without constraining choices. Sensory details like breath fogging shard are selective and urgency-appropriate, yet environment doesn’t actively pressure decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (identity erasure) tightens through ink’s heartbeat sync, narrowing options to endurance. Lena’s agency in choosing to "defragment" drives escalation under accumulative lens. Conceptual cost is legible in the certificate’s lingering presence but "mattering less," though timeframe pressure feels implied rather than live-clocked.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "static isn’t empty—it’s waiting" reframed as chorus in final image. Avoids moralizing while reweighting erasure through snowflake motif. No thematic echo; Lena’s earned shift from counting down to "counting with" offers resonant answer without stating morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in character-particular details ("rosary" shard, ink as "tendrils"). Rhythmic control under pressure via fragmented syntax ("Thud-thud of her pulse") without head-hopping. Slight register drift in "defragment" term, but voice modulates perfectly from dread to solace.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor density issues: "ephemeral swirls" and "wisdom lost to the void" verge on overwriting in high-pressure beat. Otherwise strong propulsion ("She understood. The digital ghost wasn’t a person") with zero scaffold. Final line’s "ready to listen" avoids closure muddle despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms digital ghost trope through data-fragment consciousness and porcelain shard specificity. Fresh synthesis of bureaucratic horror/sci-fi feels inevitable: death certificate error directly fuels the observatory’s sentience. Bold risk in quiet closure that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
