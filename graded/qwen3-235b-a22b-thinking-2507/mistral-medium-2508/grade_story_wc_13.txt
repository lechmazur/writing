<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elspeth’s illustrator identity versus vanishing moths, but "interrupted cadence" as diagnostic label triggers -0.4 penalty in peak tension; embodied choices like hurling the jar feel earned yet flaw slightly mars climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise—the echo’s silence and silver thread pull reconfigure time’s stakes with visceral cost (pendant burning cold, giant shifting)—but orientation falters past 120 words, delaying "who/where" until Elspeth’s name drops late, warranting -0.3 penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Canal system pressures choices (leaning over edge, jar-throwing), but setting anchors arrive too late for full constraint; micro-setting (moth sketch) charges closure yet orientation penalty caps score, preventing higher band despite vivid specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens is masterful—boy’s "borrowing time" tightens stakes into visceral trade-offs (giant waking, towers unbuilding)—with cost legible in the city’s gasp and dissolving leash; agency-driven deepening elevates tension without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (moths dissolving into sketch margins, echoes as "silence") without moralizing; final image reweights time’s fragility as "echoes beginning to speak," but Q2’s orientation flaw caps score despite resonant non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("moth wings like stained glass," ink bleeding upward") modulates rhythm to mirror the city’s stutter; voice remains coherent under pressure, though delayed orientation slightly weakens early POV anchoring without disrupting tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts—sentences like "water hissed, then stilled" propel with layered meaning—but "interrupted cadence" as defined term in high-pressure beat risks slight overwriting, capping score despite otherwise immaculate rhythm and density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-as-physical (borrowed with interest) transforms tropes through illustrator lens; risk-taking in structure heightens stakes, yet "giant city" archetype lacks radical novelty, preventing 9.0 despite organic emotional truth and specificity.</comment>
