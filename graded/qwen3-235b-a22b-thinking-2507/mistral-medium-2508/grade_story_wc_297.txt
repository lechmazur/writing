<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in scars' sap-weeping and embodied urgency; contradictory impulses (fear/determination) drive maze navigation. Final choice lacks visible cost escalation beyond transformation—scars blooming feels abstract without prior stakes deepening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (scars blooming, covenant's weight), but escalation relies on mystical intervention (future self) rather than protagonist agency under Accumulative lens. Orientation clear by 100 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cobalt glade functions as micro-setting: maze shifts constrain choices, willow bark guides action. Recurring clipping charges final image (sprouting leaf), meeting 9+ gate through environmental pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uneclipsing covenant) tightens via sensory accumulation, but cost legibility falters—future self's "covenant not ready" undercuts tension. Escalation lacks protagonist-driven tradeoffs; resolution hinges on revelation, not earned choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through scars-as-guides motif; ending reweights covenant as "waiting" not broken. Avoids moralizing—conceptual cost crystallized in sprouting leaf, fulfilling non-literal answer requirement without stated morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sky bruised into dusk," sap-weeping scars) modulates rhythm under pressure. Minor overwriting ("anxious elation") slightly dilutes urgency, but elisions taught early pay off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful cadence shifts, but "world held its breath" cliché and adjacent synonym loops ("heed/heeding") trigger minor scaffold penalty. Closure image remains vivid despite lyrical flourishes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-travel tropes via root-bound scars and loom-like maze. Risk-taking heightens stakes—covenant's "waiting" reframes destiny—without gimmickry, meeting 9+ synthesis requirement.</comment>
