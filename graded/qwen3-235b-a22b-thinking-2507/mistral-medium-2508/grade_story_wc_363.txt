<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; grief dominates without layered conflict. Micro-choices like cracking the bead with teeth show embodied agency, but interiority remains singularly focused, missing the 9+ requirement for simultaneous contradictory impulses driving the final choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "he sat down... began to weave his own thread" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost (silver-dusted fingers, silent sacrifice). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds perfectly through atmospheric escalation, but one subtle tightening isn't quite enough for 9.5+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard and bamboo actively constrain choices (bead found at apple tree, dissolution site) and charge closure ("bones woven into roots"). Micro-setting (loom, amber) directly shapes the climax, meeting the 9+ gate by altering tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through density: bead discovery → weaving → dissolution narrows options to silent sacrifice. Cost is palpable ("sender must stay"), but escalation lacks a decisive tightening beat under Accumulative lens; deepening alone caps near 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image of him weaving silver threads offers resonant answer to "can silence connect?" without moralizing. Theme emerges purely from particulars ("raveling silence" woven, hums in branches), avoiding abstraction or thematic echo in the devastatingly quiet payoff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("silence coiled like smoke," "threads glowed faintly like embers under ash") modulates rhythm under pressure. Psychic distance shrinks during bead-cracking, but the seamless shift to his POV in closure slightly risks focalization purity despite intentional design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dissolve, not into air, but into distance" demonstrates peak-beat density without muddle. Propulsion through concrete verbs ("cracked," "wove," "shivered") and final line recharging "raveling silence" achieves flawless line-level control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms weaving tropes via "silence as potential thread" logic; emotional specificity in sacrifice ("did not weep") avoids generic templates. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightens stakes, though the orchard's patience slightly echoes familiar motifs without full transformation.</comment>
