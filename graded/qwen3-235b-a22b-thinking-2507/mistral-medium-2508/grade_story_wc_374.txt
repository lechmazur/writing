<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (skepticism vs sensory truth) manifest physically when compass points to her reflection; micro-choice to kneel crystallizes stakes with visceral cost in dissolving ring.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: compass dissolving into veins forecloses her identity as tracker while aurora’s reconfigured compass rose makes conceptual price legible; Accumulative lens holds through sensory density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Lavender bluffs function as micro-setting charging closure: stems bending *into* wind during final step actively constrain choice and reconfigure the landscape’s agency, fulfilling 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through sensory escalation (ozone → terrestrially cosmic) with protagonist-driven deepening; the dissolving compass imposes irreversible physiological cost that reshapes her final stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reconfiguration: "the world had always been a map, and she’d just learned how to read it with her tongue" avoids moralizing while charging closure with earned ambiguity about identity loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in taste-based synesthesia ("bitter tang of iron when someone nearby was holding a hurricane in their ribs"); rhythmic control intensifies under pressure with purposeful fragments ("She licked her lips.")</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; every image propels momentum ("petals trembling like static on an old transmission" establishes physics metaphor early). Final line’s "compass had never been broken" crystallizes closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms weather-carrier trope through specific sensory mechanics (taste as translation) and non-binary resolution; risk-taking in physics-as-magic framing deepens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
