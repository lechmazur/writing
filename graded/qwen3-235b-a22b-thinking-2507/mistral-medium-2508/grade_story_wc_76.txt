<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak; "pulse a counterpoint to the lighthouse’s trembling" embodies contradictory tension. Final choice earned through tactile micro-choices (yoyo’s weight shifting, string burning). Villagers’ label "neatly inventive" reveals social cost without diagnostic interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "the world was lighter without him" reconfigures stakes under Accumulative lens. Orientation clear by line 3 ("Elias Veyne, the counter-clockwise clockmaker"). "One pull" escalation tightens options irrevocably; cost legible in erased reflection and backward clocks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Hunger stones constrain choice (low-tide window) and charge closure: "carvings deepened" enabling descent, then "tide erased" the reflection. Yoyo’s "bruised violet" radiance directly alters tactics. Micro-setting (string burning like a wick) pressures the climax beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stepping beyond fate) signaled by "unmake it" and tightened through ritual sequence. Agency in "One pull" forecloses shore-bound existence; cost crystallized in "the sea forgot his name." Escalation driven by Elias’ choices under Accumulative lens, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through hunger stones’ reweighting ("warning" to "map") and "unmaking the future" realization. Final image ("Elias was still spinning") offers non-literal answer to transcendence without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; "latent radiance" integrates with plot and closure cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "axle humming when spun backward" reflects Elias’ time-obsession. Rhythmic control under pressure ("One pull. The mechanism groaned, then sang"). Non-standard grammar ("counter-clockwise clockmaker") taught early and paid off in closure’s counter-clockwise gears.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "bruised violet of a storm’s underbelly" avoids figurative muddle. Sentence propulsion accelerates with "The radiance surged, wrapping his ankles in cold fire." Final line’s "silent" charges closure without scaffold. Density peaks in climax without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms time-manipulation tropes via yoyo mechanics and hunger stones. Emotional specificity in "raw and bleak and exhilarated" laugh avoids cliché. Risk-taking (counter-clockwise physics) heightens stakes coherently; premise fails the transformation test only marginally.</comment>
