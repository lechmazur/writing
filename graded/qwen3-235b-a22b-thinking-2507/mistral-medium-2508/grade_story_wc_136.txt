<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (precision vs grief) drives closure choice; embodied hesitation ("breath fogged") and micro-choice (placing punch) earn renunciation. Sister's brief appearance crystallizes relationship pressure without sentimentality. Diagnostic label-speak avoided despite high stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (phantom punch dissolving, creased map). Accumulative lens holds: crack patterns intensify pressure toward stance crystallization. Orientation clear by line 3; vault transition taught early via mist mechanics. Cost proof: "fold that would never quite align" charges final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Phantom punch and compass function as micro-settings constraining every choice; cracks evolve causally from street to pedestal. Final creased map charges closure with tool-as-setting. Sensory hierarchy reflects mapper's bias (tactile cracks, auditory chimes). No white-room syndrome; mist actively shapes movement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confronting grief as precision detour) tightens through vault progression. Agency-driven deepening: Elias's "dare to believe" redefines options, culminating in whispered truth. Cost legible in dissolving punch and altered tactics (following new fractures). Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens; coincidence (sister's arrival) complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of embracing uncertainty emerges through creased map and dissolving punch—no stated moral. Final image ("cracks... spiraling outward like ripples") reweights prior material as non-literal answer. Avoids thematic echo; sister's "paths not meant to be followed" carries subtext, not thesis. Emotional aftereffect earned via phantom train metaphor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: mapper notices "arrow-patterned cracks," "fractal mist." Rhythmic control under pressure ("trembled, then *bit*—not into paper"). Minor register drift in vault description ("starlit dome darkening...") slightly disrupts voice. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally with emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density but "starlit dome darkening as the clocktower began its first chime" slightly overwrought. No paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary effectively. Final line ("followed the next fracture") avoids closure muddle. Template cadence avoided though "her last words a riddle..." risks simultaneity error.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope through route mapper lens and phantom punch mechanics. Emotional specificity in "precision could outrun grief" avoids generic templates. Fresh inflection: fortress as moment requiring surrender, not place. Conceptual integrity in "cracks point not to answers, but to the asking." Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
