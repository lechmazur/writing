<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (duty vs fear) manifest physically in shaking hands and micro-choices (sketching fear, not prophecy). Final endurance as "hinge" earns visible cost through embodied pulse jump and burial ritual, avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density escalates to Charged Poise closure where "hinge" realization reconfigures stakes with felt cost (shaking hands, burial choice). Orientation flawless by word 25; foghorn silence anchors time/place.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orchard constrains choice (burying shaving under oldest tree) and charges final image ("garden will remember"). Pear trees' tidal-marsh history directly informs prophecy meaning, satisfying 9+ gate via micro-setting pressure on closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elias' agency: prophecy forces shift from archiving to sketching his own fear. Cost legible in trembling hands and burial ritual. Escalation via density increase (Akkadian voice → "hinge" intimacy) under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image ("He would listen") resonates as non-literal answer to archival purpose, reweighting "listening to ghosts" memory through garden's remembering. Avoids moralizing; complexity in forgetting/remembering costs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in orchid-tinted water and "brittle as old bone" textures. Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure ("raw and rough as a root breaking stone"). Zero head-hopping; compression taught via phonograph memory.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "pulse jumped like a startled bird" exemplifies high-density embodiment. Final line ("He would listen") recharges opening "listening to ghosts" with conceptual cost. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival duty and ecological memory avoids "last archivist" tropes. Risk-taking in quiet closure lands via orchard's sentient remembering, though "velvet disquiet" borders familiar lyric mode. Transformation test passed.</comment>
