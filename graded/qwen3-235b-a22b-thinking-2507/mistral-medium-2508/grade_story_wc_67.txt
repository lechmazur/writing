<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "beauty pieced from remains" and "understanding enemy of art," but micro-choices lack tactical adaptation under pressure; mask creation backstory slightly passive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("powder would have faded") under Accumulative lens; vanishing point reweights "safety" as mirage. Rocking chair cessation slightly underdeveloped as pressure point.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gallery’s vanishing point actively constrains choice (perspective as metaphor), while mask and powder function as micro-settings charging the final image; "fractured patterns like code" embodies sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes ("mirage of safety") tighten through Liora’s ritualized dissolution, but external pressure (curator’s critique) remains observational; cost is conceptual yet legible in "understanding was the enemy of art" crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "meaning in the space between" reweights via final image of fading ashes; avoids moralizing while charging "safety" as mirage through concrete particulars like the mask’s light-refraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ashes swirled—not in grief, but in precision") with rhythmic control; minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" phrasing slightly disrupts voice during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in closure beats, but "porcelain shards clicking softly, like bones settling" creates slight metaphor coherence issue; high density maintained through "dust of a letter she’d never sent" specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "crystallizing through dissolution" transforms artist tropes; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes, though "broken things" dialogue borders on familiar archetype without sufficient distinction.</comment>
