<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses (silencing vs. perpetuating prophecy) but lacks concrete micro-choices under peak pressure; "fingering keys to unmake sound" hints at agency yet remains abstract. Flaw: motivation relies on told backstory rather than embodied present-tense struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost ("weight of the vested hush followed him"); lens holds as Accumulative/Textural through density escalation. Flaw: "no one clapped" reaction slightly softens the felt cost despite thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prism atrium constrains every choice (playing "through negative space" to counter refracted prophecies) and charges the final image ("rainbows draining into stone"). Dewdrops evolve from "tears on earth's skin" to bursting catalysts—micro-setting essential to closure's charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via density increase (mist thickening, panes weeping rainbows) under Accumulative lens, but the "hushed will wake" consequence lacks visceral immediacy. Cost is legible in audience's unnerved silence yet remains emotionally distant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "vested hush" reconfiguration: final image ("beautifully, terribly quiet") reframes prophecy as perpetual tension without moralizing. Flaw: "hungers never meant to be filled" borders on thematic echo but avoids outright statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (musician's sensory focus on vibration/negative space) with rhythmic control in "breath held so long the mist trembled." Flaw: minor filter-verb accumulation ("he had come," "he had spent") dulls immediacy in reflective beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "rainbows draining into stone like ink in water" exemplifies high-density imagery. Flaw: "silence wasn’t absence but a vested hush" risks overwritten abstraction in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "music vs prophecy" trope via specific musician logic (playing subtraction, unmaking sound); slip-of-paper reveal feels earned through recurring mist motif. Risk-taking (quiet closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
