<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Priest's motivation (illumination over exorcism) drives every micro-choice with embodied contradiction; "suspended breath" indigo embodies his tension between duty and curiosity. Entity lacks depth as character but functions effectively as thematic counterpoint.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: novice's "softer silence" crystallizes the stance shift with conceptual cost (priest's disappearance). Orientation perfect within 120 words; accumulative escalation through indigo's spread and silence coiling holds flawlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dimensional anchor isn't backdrop but active constraint ("cage missing final bar"); palette's indigo literally reshapes space and charges the final "alive" silence. Micro-setting (palette) constrains all key choices from first smear to novice's action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding vs. banishing) signaled immediately; pressure intensifies through indigo's spread and tightening silence loop. Priest's agency drives every escalation beat with visible cost (becoming the assumption he illuminated).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through indigo as "space between fear and curiosity," never stated. Final "silence... waiting" reweights everything without moralizing; "Listen" scrawled in indigo charges closure as resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>"Indigo, the hue of suspended breath" shows priest's perceptual signature; syntax modulates perfectly with tension (fragmented when entity speaks). Zero head-hopping; voice distinct under pressure ("it sounded like the color of understanding").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "silence so thick it decorated the air like frost on glass" does triple duty. Final line "silence... alive" crystallizes closure without muddle. One semicolon debate in mid-beat irrelevant to propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms exorcism trope through "loop pedal" mechanism and indigo as active inquiry. Risks poetic density but earns it via concrete stakes (warm sandals, clicking pedal); "possession would have to try harder" shows fresh inflection.</comment>
