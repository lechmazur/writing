<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: "wanted to feed it" vs "didn’t need to drown the past" crystallizes in the photo-burning choice. Embodied emotion in "weight... pressing like a confession" avoids labels. Final renunciation earned by prior causality—nailing photos to burning them—with visible cost in the liqueur’s sinking.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: ashes become "hands... reaching not to pull him under, but to lift." Accumulative lens holds—the photograph trail’s density shift reweights memory’s stake. Minor slip: liqueur sinking "without a sound" slightly neats the cost, but the reservoir’s "gave something back" salvages conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Reservoir actively constrains choices—midnight patrols expose rooftops, the ridgeway’s "skeletal trees" anchor the photo trail. Charges closure when burning photos float "onto the water’s skin" and the reservoir "gave something back," transforming setting from hunger to generative force. Micro-setting (liqueur’s sapphire hue) mirrors emotional shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias’s agency: nailing blank photos (failed expungement) to burning new ones (active release). Dominant stake ("past wouldn’t be erased") tightens through the photograph trail’s deepening meaning. Cost is unmistakable—"ashes swirling into hands... reaching to lift"—reconfiguring memory from weight to current with visceral finality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "memory isn’t a weight, but a current" crystallized in burning photos becoming reaching hands. Avoids moralizing; final image reweights prior material as Old Hollow appears "whole and golden," offering non-literal resolution to "stories no longer his to carry alone." No thematic echo or false binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: Elias notices "copper pipes still as buried bones," "flour dusting air like first snow of forgiveness." Rhythmic control under pressure—short sentences ("Not with silence.") amid lyrical flow. No head-hopping; voice modulates from restrained ("he kept the bottle") to transcendent ("reservoir’s hush mirrored his own, no longer empty, but full").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion through concrete verbs ("knelt," "unscrewed," "lit"). One borderline metaphor: "pressing like a confession" risks abstraction but is redeemed by "ribs" embodiment. Figurative language sparse in peak beats—ashes as hands earns density without muddle. Final line’s "drowned things rise" avoids sentimentality through active verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms flood trope via specific, grounded details: liqueur label’s peeling edges, scraped photo emulsion. Emotional truth in "flour like first snow of forgiveness neither voiced." Fresh inflection: reservoir "giving back" ashes as hands—not gimmick but earned synthesis. Avoids safety middle with bold, coherent risk: memory as current, not weight.</comment>
