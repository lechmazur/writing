<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Liora’s grief-driven pursuit vs. analytical restraint; micro-choices like leaving the globe reveal hierarchy of values with cost. Final renunciation of "need to know" feels earned through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "let go. Not of grief... but of the need to know" crystallizes stakes with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds—snow’s shifting physics reweights the horizon’s meaning without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The snow globe (micro-setting) charges the final image: sideways snow reconfigures the lighthouse’s meaning. Bioluminescent fish and warped desk constrain Liora’s perception, making environment integral to the closure’s emotional weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Liora’s agency: her realization that "the cost of light was the shadow left behind" forecloses understanding as a path. Conceptual cost (burden of truth) is unmistakable in the sediment-like lie and dissolving keeper dream.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the snow globe’s evolving physics; "threshold" reframes from Earhart’s note to Liora’s release. Avoids moralizing—the final quiet sea resonates as earned ambiguity, not resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Liora’s analytic lens filters details ("counterclockwise snow defying current"). Rhythmic control under pressure ("the weight of the water pressing her deeper into silence") avoids head-hopping despite reflective depth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "pulpy sculptures" and "sugar in tea" metaphors charge momentum. High density in closure beat: "snow falling sideways" reweights prior motifs without muddle. Final line’s "sea finally quiet" resolves with textural precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms discovery tropes through specific physics (counterclockwise snow) and emotional truth. The horizon-as-threshold reframing feels inevitable yet fresh; risk-taking (supernatural globe) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
