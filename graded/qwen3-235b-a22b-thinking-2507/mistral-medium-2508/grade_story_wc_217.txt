<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "tending to the incomplete" vs seeking wholeness; micro-choices (retrieving kite, writing final line) reveal values with embodied cost. Slight underdevelopment of the "frayed connection" blind spot limits 9.0 potential.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "We are all just woven dawns, coming undone" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost ("love the break"). Accumulative lens holds—each image tightens the theme’s pressure without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt lagoon constrains choices (feather retrieval, kite rescue) and charges closure via "water shiver... recognition." Sensory specificity ("wet salt," "violet bruise healing") avoids postcard cliché while mirroring emotional shifts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake (beauty in brokenness) tightens when kite string snaps—forcing action that crystallizes his stance. Agency drives escalation: retrieving kite leads to "temporary connection" realization, with cost legible in "poem felt alive—not because it was finished."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: mussel-shell feather, patched boat, and frayed kite string reweight "woven dawns" without moralizing. Final line offers resonant answer to "what is beauty?" by embracing imperfection’s cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("iridescent as oil," "warm, attentive silence") filters all details. Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure: short sentences during heron flight, lyrical flow during writing. Zero POV drift or register clashes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "turning vane into prisms" does triple duty (action/image/theme). Final line’s "coming undone" crystallizes theme without muddle. Minor over-explanation in "trembled... not from his hand" barely dents perfection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "woven dawns" transforms cliché via specific objects (mussel-shell feather, tar-sealed boat). Risk-taking in quiet closure feels inevitable, avoiding sentimentality while charging emotional truth through particulars.</comment>
