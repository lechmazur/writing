<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s blindness shapes embodied choices (water barrel diagnosis, tactile repair) rather than serving as label; micro-choice to fix via refraction—not direct access—reveals his methodology. Slight deduction for near-perfect flaw diagnosis lacking struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost: parted mist reveals path while Elias returns to solitude, his refusal of acknowledgment crystallizing the "patience over ambition" reconfiguration. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via sensory density buildup to the golden corridor image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist and water barrel constrain choices—Elias *must* use refraction to "see" the flaw, and the barrel’s ripples charge the final departure image. Depot’s anchor chain vibration and cobblestones under cane root urgency in tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (flawed navigation risking maiden voyage) tightens through Elias’s diagnosis-to-repair sequence. Cost is visceral: his isolation amid cheering crowd and the "dozen broken things" waiting, narrowing options to quiet endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Dreams need patience" emerges through the misaligned array’s fix, not stated. Final image of mist splitting reweights opening obscurity without moralizing, resonating via the wake’s "two perfect halves" as earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: all description filtered through vibration, temperature, and light refraction ("hull hummed," "mist curled cooler"). Stress compresses syntax ("He didn’t move toward the ship") without voice leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "fractured light across the water barrel" does triple duty (image, plot function, theme). Final line "still here to listen" crystallizes rhythm—no figurative muddle despite high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms steampunk tropes via sensory constraints (blind repairman using water optics). Emotional truth in "world full of things needing mending" avoids cliché; hummingbird drone feels essential, not gimmicky.</comment>
