<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in archivist's methodical unraveling versus fable acceptance; "fingers passed through it like mist" embodies the cost of merging. Slight underdevelopment of stress-induced perception degradation in peak encounter.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "didn’t reach for her notebook" crystallizes the abandonment of archival control. Hybrid lens (Situational→Accumulative) holds through the earned renunciation of documentation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ceremonial rope constrains every choice—from braiding to merging—and charges the final image with seamless braids and warm wax. Sensory specificity ("scent of oil hung thick as incense") avoids tourist cataloging through archivist’s tactile priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara’s agency: reweaving braids escalates pressure until the door’s hum deepens, narrowing options to merge or document. Cost crystallizes in the vanished ledger—archival identity sacrificed for lived absence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the rope’s transformation and final breath-made names: "better left unrecorded" reweights archival duty as active participation. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the warm wax seal’s irreversible imprint.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines via archivist’s tactile lexicon ("grooves," "grain shifted"); tension modulates through controlled rhythm shifts. Minor register drift when "fables of absence" labels the core concept mid-scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats; "ledger’s pages fluttered, the names re-forming in the steam of her lungs" achieves multi-jobbing density. Slight overwriting in "pulses of warmth radiating like a held note" dilutes immediacy with simile.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synthesizes archival tropes into fresh emotional calculus: merging as resistance to specimen-like pinning. Risk-taking elevates stakes through the rope’s irreversible transformation, avoiding gimmickry via lived-in brass-and-oil specificity.</comment>
