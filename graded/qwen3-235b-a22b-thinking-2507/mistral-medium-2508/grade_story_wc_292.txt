<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s physical tremors vs cold denial and burning the journal to preserve truth. Liora’s nervous tapping subtly reveals hidden knowledge, but her secondary role limits relationship depth despite strong micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost: burning the journal’s ashes carry salt-smell and laughter, reconfiguring the jet stream from trap to door. Causal lens holds flawlessly—each pressure drop tightens options toward the irreversible choice with the nail.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The observation deck’s shattered glass isn’t backdrop but constraint—Elias must press the nail *there* to split reality. Final image of the jet stream as "a door" charges the weather station’s micro-setting with thematic weight, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through Elias’s sprint against Liora’s warnings: redeeming Orin’s name versus survival. The nail’s warmth compelling action despite alarms creates relentless causal escalation, with the burned journal’s ashes embodying the felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through the evolving "door" motif—from journal verse to literal portal to final metaphor—avoiding moralizing. The burned journal’s ashes smelling "like salt and old paper" delivers non-literal resolution: some doors must reopen to heal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in map-librarian details: "atmospheric drift patterns," fogged goggles, and the nail’s "wrong frequency" hum. Sentence rhythm fractures under storm pressure ("He should’ve obeyed. But...") without losing Elias’s voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels plot ("the air *ripped*"). Figurative language stays sparse yet potent ("storm coiled like a fist"), with the final line’s "door, waiting" avoiding overwriting while charging the motif. One borderline thematic phrase limits to 9.4.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "storm as portal" through jet stream physics and copper nail mechanics. Emotional truth in Elias’s quiet resolution—burning proof to honor truth—avoids cliché. Risk-taking (reversible exile as literal physics) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
