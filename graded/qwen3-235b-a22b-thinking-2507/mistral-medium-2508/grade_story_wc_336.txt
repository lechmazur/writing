<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in pruning metaphors ("hunger to shape the unseen"), but girl’s underdevelopment limits relationship crucible. Final choice earned through lifetime of embodied practice, though epiphany risks abstraction near closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: sapling sprouting as "debt" crystallizes cost under Accumulative lens. Orientation anchors by line 5; veil transition taught early pays off in visceral departure. Cost legible in "Elias would call it a debt."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Parapet/waterfall micro-setting enables veil access; heirloom seed constrains choice (not for soil) and charges final image. "Moss-slick stones" and "juice thick, electric" exemplify purposeful tactility that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving wonder) tightens when seed "pulsed warm," narrowing options to theft. Agency-driven deepening: pruning knowledge directly enables solution. Cost visible in Elias's vanishing and "debt" framing under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pruning-as-transmission metaphor; final image ("children recognized them instantly") reweights wonder without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by making insight concrete via sapling’s growth and girl’s return.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("colors too vivid for mortal eyes," "saplings whispering in language of light") with rhythmic control. Lyrical compression taught early ("another layer") pays off in closure; no head-hopping despite veil transition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "juice bled thick, electric" exemplifies high-density propulsion. One minor echo ("waterfall’s song rose like a question" slightly mirrors earlier mist descriptions) but no closure impact. Figurative language serves pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "wise elder" trope through pruning-specific mechanics; seed-as-bridge concept feels inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional truth in "wonder was not something you kept" avoids abstraction.</comment>
