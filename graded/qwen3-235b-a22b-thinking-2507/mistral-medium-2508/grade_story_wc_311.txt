<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "regret was just another kind of fear, and he had no room left to carry it," embodying flaw-driven motivation. Micro-choices like pressing the spire into the Leviathan reveal value hierarchies under pressure. Slight thinness in secondary character interaction limits relationship crucible depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "the named monsters rose into it" crystallizes options with undeniable cost in "He already did." Orientation anchors by word 40 (observatory dome, wax cylinders). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds flawlessly through the resonant reconfiguration of echoes into named sacrifices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The atlas page functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (reweighting ink into monsters) and charges the final image (tucked into ribs where heart was). Sensory details like "paper was cold, but beneath it, something hummed" filter through reaper’s grief-specific perception without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by reaper’s agency: crystallizing fears narrows options from abstract dreads to named hungers. Cost is unmistakable in "He already did" regarding regret, which forecloses emotional capacity. Single deepening (fears finding monsters) perfectly suffices for length under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "names were the first step toward sacrifice" gains weight when echoes become "sacrifices waiting to be heard." No moralizing; the final image reweights naming’s cost without stating a moral, avoiding thematic echo despite the prompt-like concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: reaper notices "light scatters at dusk" and "fears crystallized first," not generic descriptions. Rhythmic control under pressure ("The fears crystallized first. A woman’s terror...") avoids template cadence. Patterned elision (recordings backstory) taught and paid off early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels ("His bones caught the light, not as reflection but as absorption"). Figurative language ("regret was just another kind of fear") avoids muddle even in peak beats. Final propulsion ("He adjusted the atlas page in his ribs and kept walking") crystallizes closure without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specific, grounded choices: reaper as fear-collector crystallizing dreads into atlas monsters. Emotional truth in "hollow so he could carry others’ grief" avoids generic templates. Risk-taking with accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
