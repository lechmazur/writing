<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (chasing fragments vs. needing wholeness) act simultaneously when pressing the jade; final keeper choice earned by years of pilgrimage with visible cost (jade vanishing). No diagnostic labels—emotions embodied via breath shapes and trembling fingers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options when Elias understands healing is "revealing what was always there," with undeniable cost in "jade... warm, then weightless, then gone." Accumulative lens holds through final reconfiguration of love’s storage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Camera obscura (tool) constrains choices by forcing lens adjustments to capture truth and charges closure when projecting her image onto Elias’s eyelids. Viaduct’s crumbling stone physically pressures movement while mirroring emotional fragility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias’s agency: kneeling for the jade deepens conflict from searching to confronting truth, narrowing options to a single breath. Cost legible when the jade’s disappearance reweights his purpose ("keeper now"), though secondary stake (plague memory) slightly dilutes focus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—floating embers as "unused love"—avoiding moralizing. Final line "Here is where the unused love goes" reweights opening without stating a moral, making the abstract tangible through river imagery and breath mechanics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in Elias’s selective noticing ("breath form shapes—serpent, then key") and rhythmic control under pressure ("thread of silver connecting their chests"). Voice modulates from hazy introspection to crystalline revelation without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; sentences vary rhythm ("The viaduct bloomed anew...") while advancing atmosphere. Minor deduction for "wet earth and iron" metaphor risking slight dissonance, but payoff in "river’s embers" justifies density without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "pilgrim of sparks" grounded in camera obscura mechanics and jade’s breath-based truth-revealing. Transformation test passed: swapping "jade" for generic "crystal" would break the story’s causal logic and closure charge.</comment>
