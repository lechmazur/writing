<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (prison vs lens) manifests in embodied choices; micro-choice of unfolding page corner reveals hierarchy of values with cost ("throat tightened"). No diagnostic labels despite high-stakes realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost ("years," "frozen steps"); Accumulative lens holds through density increase (numbers → light → burning ice). Minor momentum dip in reflection section compensated by concrete cue (goggles warming).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Icebound spire actively constrains choice (recording light angles/temperatures) and charges final image ("ice didn't just glint—it burned"). Micro-setting (goggles) dictates perception shifts and closure's refracted light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (will spire remain prison or become lens?) deepens via agency-driven escalation (diary interpretation); cost of years of misperception legible in "frozen steps." Tight for length with single decisive deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (light physics, frozen roses), not abstraction; final image reweights "cold" as conceptual cost without moralizing. Avoids false binaries by embracing necessary anguish.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("light like broken promises," "wind howled like a tune") modulates rhythm under pressure; lyric compression taught early (elevator ascent as timeline) pays off in closure's crystallized image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line multi-tasks (e.g., "brass cables singing" establishes setting/character/theme). Final sentence's rhythmic control ("clarity was worth every frozen step") crystallizes closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "finding hope" trope through specific ice/light physics; spire-as-prism metaphor feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
