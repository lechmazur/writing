<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("arsonist’s daughter turned firefighter") manifests in concrete micro-choices: stitching coin as reminder, binding wound with same thread. Blood-darkened thread shows embodied cost; avoids therapy-speak. Slight motivation gap—why this lagoon now?—prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: "coin a steady pulse against her ribs" crystallizes duality of fire with felt cost (blood-darkened thread, trembling hands). Orientation clear by line 3; Accumulative/Textural lens holds. Coincidental boy arrival slightly undermines pressure buildup but cost legibility saves escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon and coin constrain choices—she stitches coin into coat here, binds wound with same thread. Final image ("lagoon’s surface rippled with gold") charges closure by grafting light to water, mirroring her thematic shift. Micro-setting (thread/coin) essential; avoids white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving compassion heals) tightens when boy’s blood stains thread—a visible price altering tactics (using coin as anchor). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, but boy’s arrival feels coincidental rather than pressured escalation, limiting deepening to single meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: blood-darkened thread, singing scars, "fire that warmed instead of consumed." Final image reweights "scars" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by embedding insight in action (pressing boy’s palm to coin), though "compassion wasn’t absence of fire" edges close to statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "kelp-drift peace," "clouds shifted... rippled with gold" filter world through firefighter’s tactile lens. Voice modulates from reflective to urgent during crisis. Slight register drift in "unyielding compassion" but rhythmic control under pressure (wound-binding sequence) sustains distinct texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; "blood-darkened thread" exemplifies high-density prose. Figurative language ("shadows drifting like kelp") serves momentum without muddle. Minor overwriting risk in "gracefully alert precision," but rhythmic variation ("She didn’t hesitate... fingers working swiftly") sustains propulsion through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: volcanic ash as healing medium, scars as song. Transforms "arsonist’s daughter" trope through specific logic (black sand = remnant of fire she now fights). Avoids safety-middle by embracing moral ambiguity—father’s legacy neither redeemed nor vilified—but lacks one bold structural risk to hit 9.0.</comment>
