<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Veythas’ motivation—ignoring warnings for centuries then sacrificing Lirien—feels earned through embodied contradiction (stone titan trembling like shifting sand), but the pretender’s sudden appearance lacks friction; his relief reads as convenient resolution rather than organic consequence of Veythas’ choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands flawlessly: the shattered scepter’s "weight of truth" and library’s "mercifully complete" hush crystallize cost (Lirien’s erasure) under Accumulative/Textural lens; constellations stuttering then moving again reconfigures time’s meaning with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The library’s sentient stillness (sagging shelves, "cracks between time") actively constrains Veythas’ choices and charges the final image—its "sigh" and reclaimed breath directly mirror the opening’s abandonment, making environment inseparable from closure’s emotional charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Veythas’ micro-choices (tracing ink, whispering Lirien’s name), narrowing options via Accumulative pressure, but the pretender’s unearned appearance weakens causal escalation; his relief feels coincidental rather than a direct consequence of the scepter’s sundering.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the library’s rebirth: "Here the lie ended. Here the drift was still" reweights time’s fluidity as both wound and healing, avoiding moralizing while charging the final image with the cost of truth’s unbearable weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice’s tactile specificity ("ink pellet pressed like a wound," "breath tasted of dust") creates a distinct perceptual signature, but minor register drift occurs in the pretender’s dialogue ("I never wanted it" feels too modern against Veythas’ archaic rhythm).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with zero loops—every phrase layers atmosphere and causality ("constellations stuttered, their light fracturing like glass")—yet "frayed like the hem of a god’s discarded robe" slightly overwrites the opening beat, diluting momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in the library as a temporal character and "rune of drift" mechanics, but "diminutive titan" risks archetype until stone-body details ground his struggle; the graceful collapse trope transforms through visceral specificity (shattered basalt, ink-stained parchment).</comment>
