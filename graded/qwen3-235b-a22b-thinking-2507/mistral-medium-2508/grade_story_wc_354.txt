<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s fear of playing "when stakes are invisible" versus his need to translate silence; embodied via worry stone’s dent and magnetic tremors. Girl’s observation "You’re afraid" crystallizes his micro-choice to reach for the pawn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands when pieces align into "something jagged and luminous," reconfiguring the covenant’s meaning with felt cost in Elias’s lightened chest. Accumulative lens holds: density builds through magnetic vibrations and silences, tightening stakes toward the dent-focused move.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (worry stone’s dent) constrains Elias’s final choice and charges the closure image; nexus vibrations physically shift chess pieces, making environment inseparable from tactical pressure. Twilight’s "shimmering lines" mirror knight-path metaphors without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deciphering the covenant’s silence) tightens when the girl asks "why you count spaces," forcing Elias to articulate his philosophy before making his dent-focused move. Cost is legible in his vulnerability: "Not of losing. Of playing at all."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through chess gaps and magnetic silences, never stated outright. Final image—"a game that had remembered how to breathe"—resonantly answers the central question by reweighting the "eclipsed covenant" as active waiting, not brokenness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: Elias notices "paths of knights who never reached destinations" in magnetic lines. Rhythm modulates from measured ("twilight bled") to urgent ("nexus pulsed") under pressure, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cracked earth where old covenant had once bound the land—now eclipsed by silence" layers setting/theme in one propulsive line. Final phrase "remembered how to breathe" crystallizes closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms chess tropes via magnetic physics and "eclipsed covenant" gambit; specificity of bone-river stone pieces and dent-worn worry stone avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (textural closure) heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
