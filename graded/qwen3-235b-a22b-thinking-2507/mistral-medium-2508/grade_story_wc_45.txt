<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Liora’s "forgiving skeptic" trait manifests in embodied contradiction—calmly offering a tooth while clutching a charred needle—driving her pivotal bargain. Micro-choices like pressing the tooth to her palm reveal hierarchy of values under pressure, avoiding therapy-speak. Brother’s return lacks visible struggle, slightly softening the cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the needle’s hum against ribs crystallizes conceptual cost of mending ruptures, with accumulative lens holding through sensory deepening. Final image reconfigures "wounds into stars" with undeniable pressure. Brother’s seamless return slightly undermines stakes escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The changeling’s tooth constrains choice (trading it for memories) and charges closure via dissolving light and new teeth imagery. Well symbols’ "teeth ache" embodies constraint, but "fruits no one tasted" leans generic before redemption through pulsing flowers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via sensory density (crushed mint/iron scent thickening air) as Liora connects needle to changeling, tightening options toward "turn wounds into stars." Cost is legible in brother’s smooth palms, though physical struggle is absent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through bone-setting → "setting the world" reprise without moralizing. Final image ("hands steady") resonates as non-literal answer to mending ruptures, elevated by needle’s hum implying enduring cost. No thematic echo; wounds-as-constellations avoids abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: bone-setter POV notices "root damp with blood," not just tooth. Syntax varies under pressure (short bursts during memory flood), with zero head-hopping. "Forgiving skeptic" label slightly mars immediacy but is redeemed by action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; "garden sighed" compresses setting/character in one stroke. Figurative language sparse but potent ("spun wound into door"). "Waxy green" edges toward overwriting, but final line’s concrete parallelism ("setting bones" → "set the world") avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms changeling trope via bone-setting logic: wounds become navigational stars, not battles. Emotional specificity in Liora’s yearning (keeping charred needle) avoids safety middle. Risk-taking in quiet closure earns distinction bonus.</comment>
