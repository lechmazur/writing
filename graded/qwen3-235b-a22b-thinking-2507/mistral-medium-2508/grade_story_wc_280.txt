<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (Lydia's "itch in the bones" vs duty to fade) drive choices; Elias's despair embodied through "shaking hand" and "hollow eyes" with visceral cost in "pocketed the pills." No diagnostic labels, only sensory truth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: Elias stepping forward while Lydia fades, the pills' implication palpable in "steady now, a metronome." Accumulative lens holds through sensory accumulation, cost proof in "pocketed the pills" and heartbeat shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard actively constrains choices (path "unspools," trees "lean in" to whisper), while tarot coin functions as micro-setting charging closure. "Petals crunching like brittle applause" exemplifies purpose-driven specificity that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Lydia's agency under Accumulative lens: intertwining branches to produce visions reweights Elias's stake with felt cost in "pocketed the pills." Pressure tightens through sensory density, not causal turns, perfectly aligning with lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "the garden carries the rest" reweighting despair without moralizing; final image ("music tasted like hope") offers non-literal answer to "lure possibility" without stated moral. No thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: synesthetic POV shapes all description ("sound that wasn't sound but the color of dusk"). Rhythmic control under pressure via fragments ("Lydia smiled.") with pattern taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "petals that crunched underfoot like brittle applause" achieves high density without muddle. Final line "tasted like hope" charges closure with zero loops or scaffold; one minor density risk in "bruised silver" moon avoided through voice cohesion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope via synesthetic orchard magic; emotional truth in "ghost in the wings" metaphor avoids generality. Specificity of tarot coin (fool/weeping king) and "orchard magic" synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
