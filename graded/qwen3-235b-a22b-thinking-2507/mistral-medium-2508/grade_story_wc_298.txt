<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (reckless idealism vs earned endurance) crystallizes in the final choice to "take something back," with embodied cost in the wilting flower and coiled roots—no therapy-speak mars the pivotal trade.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands via the white flower's wilting (visible cost) and Liora’s "scars to carry" realization, with the Accumulative/Textural lens holding through sensory reweighting of "holes" into "hers."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard’s roots actively constrain choice (pulling guilt) and charge the final image (blossoms "heavy with weight"), while the white flower’s wilting embodies the trade’s cost—micro-setting as essential environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Liora’s agency (stitching ashes into bark), narrowing options to a single trade with visible cost (the wilting flower), though Veyra’s late appearance slightly softens the pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the orchard’s barter rules reweighted by Liora’s final walk—"the past was in the earth now"—avoiding moralizing while offering a resonant, non-literal answer to healing guilt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("roots twisting like veins," "breath fogged the air like a promise") modulates rhythm under pressure, with elision (child’s name) taught early and paid off in the root’s pull.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in "sweet and bright as the first light of dawn" slightly muddles the high-pressure beat, but propulsion remains sharp; no loops dull the closure’s "clean, cold, and hers" finality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via the orchard’s barter economy, with specificity (mother’s lullaby traded for dreamless night) making emotional stakes irreplaceable—risk-taking heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
