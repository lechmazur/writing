<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "face half-drowned in doubt, half-lit by desperate glow" and embodied micro-choices like pressing the key "like a sigh"; final renunciation earned through quilting memories into scars with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: "broken things became the gold that held the shattered world together" reweights kintsugi with undeniable conceptual cost as workshop dissolves; Accumulative lens holds through sensory density tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Acid sea actively pressures choices by eating floorboards, while key ring charm functions as micro-setting charging the final image; "brass ribs creaking" shows tactile navigation constraining tactics under stress.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via Accumulative lens through sensory density ("acid sea hissed closer") and cadence shifts, but statue's response leans slightly on coincidence rather than pure protagonist agency at the climax beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "kintsugi for the soul" action rather than statement; final image reweights "stitch together what others break" into "became the gold" without moralizing, though "chasing: not an answer, but a choice" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("pockmarks... wounds from time before memory") with rhythmic control under pressure; "voice threading through gaps like a needle pulling time" teaches pattern early, paid off in final silence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "gears and cogs unspooling into hungry dark" delivers triple duty with propulsion. Minor abstraction in "half-drowned in doubt" prevents 9.0 despite otherwise flawless density in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy and kintsugi through specific "gold-laced epoxy" details; "stitching themselves into the story" transforms trope. Tone lacks modulation during climax, missing risk-distinction bonus.</comment>
