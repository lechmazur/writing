<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "hands shook, but not from fear" and satchel-bouncing run toward danger; father's backstory anchors micro-choices without over-explaining. Minor over-reliance on "pulse watchfully calm" as untested trait caps score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "he’d drag it into the light, even if it drowned him too" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds through water/symbol density, though walkie-talkie interruptions slightly strain causality coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Subway tunnel actively constrains choices: damp mortar bricks vibrate with water pressure, forcing Elias to shatter the lantern for access. Final "damp mortar" detail charges the closure image by making erasure visceral and immediate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency—shattering the lantern to expose flooding—but the walkie-talkie’s "same MO" info dump slightly undercuts organic escalation. Cost remains undeniable via "drowned him too" conceptual sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through subway’s "graveyard of choices" without moralizing; final "he remembered" reweights the lantern’s meaning as resistance. Avoids thematic echo by embedding insight in action (running toward archives, not stating purpose).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice distills Elias’s forensic precision via tactile details ("grout," "silt-thick water"), but walkie-talkie dialogue flattens tension with exposition. Perceptual signature holds through stress—sensory narrowing to vibrations during crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Sound echoing like a gunshot" creates minor metaphor clash in climax; otherwise, zero loops with propulsive rhythm ("He followed the sound... deeper"). Final "constellation of forgotten stars" risks overwriting but earns payoff via thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms investigative trope through Underground Railroad tunnel history—specific "arrows in grout" details make erasure feel urgent. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off, though premise echoes historical thriller conventions slightly.</comment>
