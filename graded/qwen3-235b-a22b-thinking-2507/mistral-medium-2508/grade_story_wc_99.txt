<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (stubborn roots vs. mending frayed edges) act simultaneously; final choice to plant the compass earned through embodied micro-choices (humming, palm-press) with visible cost in the brother's unsaid apology.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: horizon transforms from "wound" to "where sky remembered water" via accumulated pressure under Accumulative/Textural lens, with cerulean regret’s weight legible in the bonsai’s blue leaves.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Islet’s dampness constrains action (humming into wet sand) and charges closure; saltgrass, compass, and bonsai actively shape tactics and final image, avoiding static description through tactile integration ("roots curl around it like an apology").</comment>
<question>4</question><question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency: compass’s color shift forces realization that "unsaid" apologies must be diffused, narrowing options to planting it, with cost crystallized in the brother’s slammed-door argument now reconfigured as mended net-humming.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: final image of "exact blue of a held-back I’m sorry" reweights the drowned horizon without moralizing, embracing complexity through the compass’s lace pattern as method for holding what can’t be held.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines via character-particular diction ("damp sighs," "compass bled color"); rhythmic control modulates under pressure (short phrases during needle shudder) with no head-hopping or filter verbs diluting immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("tides of remembrance pulled at him, not as waves but as a current beneath his ribs") with clear propulsion. Minor abstraction in "tides of remembrance" redeemed by immediate concrete action (palming wet sand).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes through specific objects (bonsai-ship hull, lace-compass); "cerulean regret" tone synthesizes fresh emotional truth via mended net-humming and blue leaves, avoiding sentimentality through craft-bound specificity.</comment>
