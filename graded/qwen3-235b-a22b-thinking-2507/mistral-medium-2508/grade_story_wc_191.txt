<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lacks visible internal conflict before pivotal renunciation; "breath hitched" is label-only emotion. Micro-choices reveal dedication but contradictory impulses absent at climax. Motivation ("wisely adventurous") stated not demonstrated under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Flawless causal closure: Earned Stasis via throne's destruction with legible cost ("weight lifting from the world"). Sunrise deadline tightens options. Orientation perfect by line 3; ruby flake's resonance drives every turn toward crystallized refusal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orchard actively constrains choices: kaleidoscopic waterfall requires lenses, peeling bark reveals path, ordinary-ripened fruit charges final image. "Glowing pomegranates" to "dimming to ordinary red" mirrors thematic shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes ("break cycle of power") remain abstract until throne shatters; no personal cost shown during descent. Sunrise deadline creates real pressure but conceptual cost lacks visceral immediacy at peak moment. One tightening (below vs. upward) sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: throne dissolution and rewritten murals embody "thrones meant empty" without moralizing. Final image of Elsin eating ordinary fruit while city sleeps resonates with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dew of forgotten fruit," "twin moons bleeding") but stress-induced diction doesn't degrade (ladder descent remains lyrical). Minor POV drift in "city would wake soon" slightly undermines knowledge boundaries.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "liquid light shattering mirror-ceiling" achieves high density without muddle. Only flaw: "breath hitched" is bodily cliché. Final line avoids thematic echo while recharging "unmarked path" motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "chosen one" trope via renunciation; specific details (brass lens equations, silver-leaved trees) avoid generic fantasy. Risk-taking in quiet ending heightens stakes without gimmickry. "Hidden orchard" slightly familiar but redeemed by execution.</comment>
