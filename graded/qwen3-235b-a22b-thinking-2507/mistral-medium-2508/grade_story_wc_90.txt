<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lien’s simultaneous grief and joy during stitching; embodied via "body hummed lighter" and "fingers trembled," avoiding diagnostic labels. Final choice to push is earned through decades of micro-choices anchored to the photograph’s warmth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: "Lien stepped through, her stitches unraveling" shows visible cost (dissolution) under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors ship/POV by line 3; disorientation serves closure via gravity shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The bone ship’s recycled hull actively constrains choices (gravity flickers during stitching), culminating in "ship’s bones sang" charging the final image. Green grass reweights prior sorrow with embodied specificity, avoiding generic setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (opening the dimension) tightens through Lien’s agency: each stitch attempt narrows options, with escalating cost (unraveling body). The tear’s resistance creates earned pressure, culminating in irreversible trade-off during "push."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "stitching sorrow" motif: "something new began to grow" reweights grief without moralizing. Final green grass and child’s laugh offer resonant answer to "remembering how to die" via concrete sensory payoff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is immaculate—"shadows leaned in, hungry" reflects Lien’s psyche. Rhythmic control under pressure ("The needle went in again. The thread held.") avoids syntactic monotony while teaching patterned elision early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; density peaks in closure ("stitches unraveling like a ladder of light") without figurative muddle. Strategic telling ("three hundred years") compresses backstory without sacrificing propulsion in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "last human" trope through bone-ship specificity and grief-as-stitching mechanics. The "lack" of Kwan Yin’s tear reconfigures dimension mythology with emotional truth, avoiding derivative safety.</comment>
