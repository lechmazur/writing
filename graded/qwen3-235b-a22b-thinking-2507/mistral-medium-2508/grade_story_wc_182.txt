<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s embodied interiority shines (“teeth on edge,” pocket watch ticking backward) but lacks contradictory impulses until the climax; his final weeping for the forgotten name feels earned yet abrupt without layered emotional groundwork.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: Elias becoming “a gap” crystallizes his arc with visceral cost (blank diary, lost name), though the traveler’s unraveling edges toward coincidence under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Botanical diary’s reverse-blooming flowers constrain Elias’s choices and charge the final image (blank pages); mountain’s sigh mirrors his dissolution without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</comment><question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency (tea lacing, renegotiation), but the traveler’s sudden “Liora” revelation lacks sufficient struggle to fully reweight the trade-off’s cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through absences (“unwritten light,” “symphony in silence”), avoiding moralizing; final line’s “bookstore waited with her” resonates without stating the cost of knowledge theft.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (“whispers between words,” “pulsed faintly under his touch”) modulates rhythm under pressure; non-standard semicolons enhance lyrical tension without muddying causality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; “petals curling inward as if retreating” exemplifies textural specificity, though “grief was a renewable resource” slightly drifts into thematic abstraction in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel tropes through linguistic archaeology; the Library of Unlearned Lessons feels inevitable via prior textual details, avoiding derivative safety.</comment>
