<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias' shift from archivist to medium; embodied cost in "fingers brushing artifacts" triggering visions. Final renunciation of archival identity earned by debris parley micro-choice. Slight over-articulation in "truth wasn't meant to be archived" edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: dissolving diary forecloses preservation path with conceptual cost ("weight lifted from sky"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—debris patterns escalate pressure to stance crystallization. Cost legible in "warm, thick with weight of stories never told" wading moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon constrains every choice (vision trigger, wading site, dissolution point) and charges the final image. Sensory specificity ("rust like dried blood," "heat of buried secrets") filters through archivist's lens. Zeppelin library's neutrality critique enriches but isn't pressure-tested.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth preservation vs. destruction) tightens via debris arrangement, narrowing options to parley. Cost legible in diary dissolution, but Revision Board threat resolves too easily—their retreat lacks sufficient escalation pressure despite scarred officer's hesitation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "truth wants you" crystallizes without moralizing. Final image reweights "buried words" as liberation, avoiding sentimentality. Whispered "thank you" offers resonant non-literal answer to archival dilemma—no thematic echo in closure beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: archivist notices "margins scrawled with coordinates," not just shells. Rhythmic control under pressure ("He chose the shells") avoids cadence monotony. "Retroactive fever dream" slightly drifts from lexicon but quickly recovers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-zero artifacts; "ink bleeding into screams" shows high density. Minor deduction for "retroactive fever dream" metaphor—elevated diction slightly clashes with peak-beat lexicon but doesn't obscure closure. Final line's "lighter now" avoids cliché through concrete cause.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms archive tropes via debris-as-messages system; emotional truth in archivist's identity shift. "Obsidian lagoon" avoids generic symbolism by actively constraining choices. Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off—dissolution feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
