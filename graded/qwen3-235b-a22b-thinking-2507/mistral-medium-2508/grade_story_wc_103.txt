<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in tactile contradiction: Liora both seeks connection (reaching for photos) and flees (running sideways), with bone-aching clench and disintegration dust showing earned change. No therapy-speak; flaws drive compounding choices toward "designing edges" renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "rough grain of time beneath her skin" crystallizes cost while reconfiguring options ("design the edges"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory reweighting; no causality breaks. Orientation clear by line 5 ("unbuild the oldest maze").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Garden actively constrains choices (vines recoiling/surging, hyperbolic geometry enabling escape). Halo fragment as micro-setting charges final image (dust on sleeves). Slight deduction: lavender/ozone scent motif lacks earlier tactical constraint despite vivid specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Accumulative density: fading photos → disintegration → retrocognitive entrapment. Agency crystallizes in sideways run and fragment-throwing, with visceral cost (burning palm, rough grain). Tightens to single trade-off: survive texture vs. be trapped in "when".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete reprise: "texture" evolves from abstract concept (greenhouse memory) to embodied survival ("something to survive"). Final image reweights without moralizing; trapped woman's "only textures" line feels earned, not preachy. Avoids thematic echo penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct under pressure: tactile focus (thorns, grain, burning palm) compresses syntax during crisis ("Not in space. / In when."). Zero head-hopping; rhythm modulates from lyrical ("sky the color of old silver") to staccato at climax. No filter-verb stacks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via concrete verbs ("hurled," "groaning," "flickering"). Figurative language sparse but precise ("disintegration wasn’t destruction. / It was unfolding"). Minor deduction: "pulsed like veins" slightly muddles botanical logic, but payoff in hyperbolic geometry justifies risk.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel tropes through tactile specificity: "texture" reframes temporal stakes as survivable grain. Bold risk in rejecting neat solutions (designing edges vs. solving center). Avoids derivative pitfalls via maze designer’s spatial cognition driving the sideways escape.</comment>
