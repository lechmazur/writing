<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lior's embodied patience ("frost cracking on cheeks") and micro-choices (pressing ear to strut) reveal contradictory impulses; sister's off-page conflict lacks sufficient on-page pressure to test his stance fully.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: viaduct's ascent crystallizes the patient revolution with visible cost (abandoning sanctuary), under Accumulative/Textural lens. Reflection stays anchored to present via moon-path tracking.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Viaduct constrains every choice (listening for "groan"), while frozen lake evolves from obstacle to active participant ("waiting"); final image charges setting with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (patient vs. impatient revolution) tightens through viaduct's shiver; cost is Lior's irreversible departure. Sister's conflict remains off-page, weakening secondary pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions ("waiting is its own kind of fire"), not moralizing; final image reweights patience as active force without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: professional focus on "magnetic viaduct's song," emotional state reflected in tactile details ("cold seep into bones like second pulse"). Zero voice slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "thousand drawn bows" metaphor avoids cliché. Minor momentum drag in "thirteen winters" reflection (0.3 deduction), but closure remains razor-sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "quiet revolution" trope via magnetic physics; "unyoking" as moon-pull not force feels inevitable. Emotional truth in "patience sculpted from impatience" avoids abstraction.</comment>
