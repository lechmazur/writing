<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("saving promise" vs "saving world from promise") drives final choice; embodied "volcanic tenderness" avoids label-speak; micro-choice tracing infinity symbol earns closure with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "He lit a match" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (burning names); Accumulative lens holds through sensory/emotional density; cost proof in ledger's ashes "curling into the shape of a question".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Archive functions as micro-setting: key's coldness against collarbone and tapestry's frayed threads directly constrain choices; final image of smoke recharges setting as "womb" with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when vandalized portrait reweights from rage to map; Elias's agency drives escalation ("he understood: the archive wasn’t a tomb"); cost legible in ledger burning but secondary accent ("volcanic tenderness") slightly dilutes dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "mercy, like memory, was volatile" reframed by final match strike; no moralizing; smoke-as-question image reweights "dangerous art" without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("scent Elias recognized as his own") and rhythmic control under pressure; "volcanic tenderness" modulates voice; patterned elision (archivist backstory) taught early and paid off in key/ledger.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-overwriting in "volcanic tenderness erupting in his chest" slightly muddles peak beat; otherwise clean propulsion ("The fire agreed" as final cadence shift); no loops but one elevated phrase in high-pressure moment caps score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "mad scholar" trope through specific stakes (lending libraries as promise vessels); risk-taking heightens coherence (burning as mercy); "promises meant to burn" synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
