<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses ('weigh the violin against her contract, or weigh your contract against the world') crystallize under pressure; visible cost in thorn-covered hands and social ruin ('thief, fraud, madwoman'). Flawed competence shown through coffee-induced visions compounding her stress without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: kneeling in dirt with singing garden reconfigures empire vs. propagation stakes with undeniable conceptual cost ('dreams heavier than empires'). Accumulative/Textural lens holds through coffee-stain pattern breaks that deepen options, with time pressure tightening tactics to the brass counterweight's decisive arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The ice violin functions as micro-setting that constrains the climax—its fragility necessitates shattering with the brass counterweight, directly charging the final image of 'ice-vine breaking through the velvet roof.' Sensory specificity (crushed violets, cold seeping into bones) filters through Elara's plant-attuned perception without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through agency: coffee stains' 'mulberry ache' third option forces shattering as the only path to propagation, narrowing choices to empire's cage or wild growth. Cost is unmistakable in the visceral thorns and social erasure ('she would let them'), reweighting 'destiny perforated' under Accumulative/Textural pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: violin shards sprouting humming crystals reweights 'perforated destiny' as necessary light-entry, avoiding moralizing. Final image ('destinies meant to be perforated—so the light could get in') offers resonant non-literal answer to empire vs. propagation without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in plant-attuned details ('wisteria thoughts brushing hers like silk'), with rhythmic compression during high stress ('She shouldn’t have drunk the coffee'). Elision of coffee-stain futures is taught early and pays off in the 'mulberry ache' deepening, avoiding head-hopping despite vine telepathy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; 'prismatic needles' and 'mulberry ache' deliver high density without figurative muddle. Final line ('reaching for the sun') resolves with action-propelled clarity, though 'mulberry ache' borders on abstraction yet fits voice-driven lexicon under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specific synthesis: provenance researcher's plant telepathy isn't power fantasy but constraint (vines' 'They will take it' urgency). Risk-taking elevates stakes—shattering the violin as 'propagation' feels inevitable yet fresh, avoiding safety-middle hedging with empire-as-compost vision.</comment>
