<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (philanthropy vs destruction) drives the egg placement with embodied cost; "fingers trembling" avoids therapy-speak while showing conflicted sentimentality under drought pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "the salt would remember its shape" reconfigures legacy under Accumulative lens; thunder’s proximity tightens the temporal pressure without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Salt flat constrains every choice (egg placement in fissure) and charges the final image; "crust brittle under boots" anchors early while dissolving egg reweights setting’s meaning with ecological cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (legacy erasure vs preservation) deepens through egg placement with felt cost; thunder’s false promise escalates pressure under Accumulative lens but lacks one visible tactical shift beyond the central act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from salt/egg reciprocity: "a single stubborn note held against silence" answers the drought’s erasure without moralizing; extinction’s cost is legible in the egg’s dissolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("cracks spelled a path") filters all description through Elias’s guilt; rhythmic control ("he knelt, pressing his palm to the salt") modulates with emotional intensity under drought pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; "warm as a secret" slightly risks cliché but redeemed by "salt might preserve it longer than any museum"; final line’s dissolution imagery avoids figurative muddle while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "guilty industrialist" trope through specific salt-flat mechanics; "cracks spelled *enough*" provides fresh inflection but lacks one additional risk-taking element to breach 9.0.</comment>
