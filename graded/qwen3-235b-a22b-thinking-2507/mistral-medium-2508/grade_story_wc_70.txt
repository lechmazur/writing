<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias’s truth-affliction manifests concretely ("words spilled unbidden, raw as honey"), driving micro-choices like swallowing fear before planting the seed. His contradictory impulses—fear of failure versus duty to wonder—crystallize in the final dialogue with the child, earning the closure with visible cost in the engineers’ inevitable disbelief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: the engineers’ future disbelief versus the child’s belief crystallizes the cost of wonder’s fragility. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density ("drones danced like they’d never known a grid"), with cost legible in "They wouldn’t believe him. But the child would"—an exact image anchoring conceptual stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lightning tower’s copper ribs and drone lattice actively constrain choices—Elias plants the seed in the beehive’s node, transforming the setting from static backdrop to functional resource. The lacquer box’s tactile recurrence ("edges smooth from years of handling") charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake—preserving wonder in mechanized routine—tightens through Elias’s agency: planting the seed starves the city of certainty, blooming wild wonder. Cost is unmistakable in the engineers’ dismissal versus the baker’s paused kneading, reweighting options under the Accumulative lens without causal shortcuts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the seed’s physicality ("black as a crow’s eye, veined with gold") and erratic drones reconfigure "wonder" beyond abstraction. The final image—drones dancing outside grids—resonantly answers the riddle without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite the child’s question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elias’s truth-affliction shapes metaphors ("raw as honey from a crushed comb"), with rhythm modulating from humming tension to chaotic release ("wings stuttering like a held breath"). No head-hopping; compression in blackout urgency remains voice-coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances momentum ("the wind carried the scent of ozone and damp earth"). Figurative language serves pressure without muddle—"drones traced chaotic paths" intensifies the climax. One barely perceptible register dip in "the city’s power would return" costs 0.1.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms the blackout trope through specific, grounded choices: tolls paid in stories, drones as pollinators, truth as physical affliction. The emotional truth about routine killing wonder feels fresh, with risk-taking (lyric closure) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
