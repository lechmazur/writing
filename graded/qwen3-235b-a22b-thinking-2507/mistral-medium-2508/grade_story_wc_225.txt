<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (kneeling vs. stepping forward) earn the final choice; embodied regret ("metal warmed, absorbing weight") avoids therapy-speak while showing irrevocable cost through tactile micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "the labyrinth stood empty... only a mirror" reconfigures the premise while the thawed village pulse makes shame's dissolution visceral; Accumulative lens holds through patterned intensification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tapestry’s threads physically constrain choices (burning fingers, weaving back frays) and charge the final image ("threads no longer frayed but strong—like the hands"); platinum labyrinth’s shifting walls mirror memory under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the tutor’s agency (decoding threads) rather than coincidence; the cost—absorbing regret into platinum—is felt in "rhythm of a heart learning to beat without shame," though the thunder motif’s escalation lacks visceral trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through chess-as-life particulars: "played not to win, but to stay" reweights strategy into presence without moralizing; the empty labyrinth as mirror offers a non-literal answer to exile’s cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("fingers tracing frayed threads," "woven hush") reflects the tutor’s tactile profession; rhythmic control shifts from staccato tension ("plucking, twisting") to flowing cadence at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fidgeting not from nerves, but from the work" exemplifies high-density propulsion; figurative language ("silence were a held breath") serves motif logic without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tropes transformed via chess tutor’s specific flaws (hesitation as strategic failure); "platinum labyrinth as mirror" synthesizes exile and self-perception into an inevitable, non-obvious emotional reconfiguration.</comment>
