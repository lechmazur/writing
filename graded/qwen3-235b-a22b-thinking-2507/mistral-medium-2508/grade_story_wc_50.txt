<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "not to mend but to listen" and cellar-of-reason metaphor; embodied cost in trembling fingers aligning gears as echoes thin. Final choice to run the flawed mechanism embodies earned endurance with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: warbled lullaby crystallizes irreversible loss ("not perfectly... stretched thin") with felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; seasonal deadline and daughter's impatience tighten pressure without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marble cavern actively constrains choices: silver veins enable reflection-studying method, weeping ice signals deadline. Final image of "timer ticked once, softly" charges closure through tactile specificity rather than ornamental description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (preserving fleeting memories) escalates through wounded season's deadline and daughter's impatience. Cost is unmistakable in the warbled echo's imperfection, narrowing options to imperfect preservation rather than perfect recall.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "store wonder like a locksmith stores keys" reweights memory's fragility without abstraction. Final image of imperfect lullaby answers central question with resonant ambiguity, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("studied the reflections," "saw the flicker") filters all detail through locksmith's trade. Rhythmic control under pressure peaks in final activation sequence; reflective passages maintain distinct tactile lexicon without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "high, clear note... bouncing like light through a prism" demonstrates high-density propulsion. Minor deduction for "bruised glow" cliché, but no figurative muddle in peak beats; closure image crystal-clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms memory trope through occupational specificity (timer as acoustic regulator) and "wounded season" metaphor. Emotional truth in "store wonder in cellar of reason" avoids sentimentality; risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes.</comment>
