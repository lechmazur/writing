<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s tactile obsession ("pulse thrumming," "cold biting") and final lantern release—a renunciation of passive listening for active creation. Flaws: faceless figure lacks differentiation from protagonist’s voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: waves "shimmered" reconfigures reality irreversibly under Accumulative lens. Orientation flawless by line 3; no causality breaks. Cost proof: "sound of waves... shimmered" crystallizes paid price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lamplighter’s lantern (tool) constrains choices throughout and charges the final image—opening metronome to closing shimmer. Sunken library’s physicality (sagging shelves, jagged ribs) directly alters tactics during discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elias’s agency: wading into shallows, pocketing tag, lighting lantern. Dominant stake (perceptual transformation) forecloses his old reality with felt cost in the final shimmer—a visible reweighting under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally: "Luminous vows are not spoken, but shown" becomes embodied action (lantern release), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights the premise with conceptual cost—silence’s "shape" as active creation, not passive discovery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "cobalt despair, amber longing" filters synesthesia through lamplighter’s sensory lexicon. Rhythmic control under pressure ("docked beneath the hull’s jagged ribs") avoids syntactic monotony. Zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "brittle sculptures of lost knowledge" slightly overwrought but pays off in "crucible" realization. Final line’s propulsion ("roar—it *shimmered*") avoids figurative muddle. Minor register drift in "conceptual cost" (-0.1).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms synesthesia trope via maritime decay ("salt-crusted deck," "brine and old promises"). Risk-taking (silence’s "shape," signing figure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity ("cobalt despair") avoids genericness.</comment>
