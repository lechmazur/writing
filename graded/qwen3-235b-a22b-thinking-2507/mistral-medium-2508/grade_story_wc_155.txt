<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete ("hands trembled," "breath curling"), motivation rooted in credible endurance of impermanence. Final choice (mixing new paints) earned but lacks visceral cost—conceptual acceptance of transience insufficiently embodied in pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise: "orchard felt like a promise") lands with undeniable conceptual cost ("film would fade... but didn’t matter"). Accumulative lens holds via sensory density; orientation anchored by 100 words. Persistent constraint (impermanence) shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ruined orchard micro-setting charges closure: skeletal trees enable film display, fog thins/reforms as emotional barometer. Fresco fragment constrains choice (must press to film) and recharges final image ("secret shared" in pocket).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes ("rediscover lost joy") materialize viscerally through scent/laughter; pressure tightens via communal projection reweighting grief. Cost unmistakable in "film would fade... knowledge network carries memory," though emotional toll remains slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action ("stitch torn edges of time" via film display), not moralizing. Final image ("orchard felt like a promise") reweights abandonment with conceptual cost—no tidy resolution, only earned hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (light-focused diction: "liquid ways," "glowed from within") with rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift in "stitch torn edges" slightly jars, but compression taught early pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("joy leaked like perfume," "dissolving like sugar in rain"). Figurative language purposeful throughout—peak beats ("For a breath, for a heartbeat") propel without muddle. One borderline cliché ("stitch torn edges") contained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: light-paints as memory medium transforms ruin tropes into "promise." Emotional specificity avoids saccharine joy (fleeting yet transformative). Slight derivative edge in "knowledge network" mechanics limits risk distinction.</comment>
