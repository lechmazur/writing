<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lena’s simultaneous urge to hate tourists yet protect the child’s innocence; embodied emotion via palm-sting overriding screams avoids therapy-speak. Minor deduction for therapist’s convenient advice slightly softening the trauma’s rawness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: photograph release crystallizes "stubborn persistence of life" with visceral cost in "weight in her chest... like roots." Orientation clear by para 2; Accumulative lens holds through cypress-leaf reprise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Arboretum constrains every choice—cypress bark smooths the photo, fig trees dictate final action. Micro-setting mastery: leaf’s "citrus and resin" scent charges the closure image while mirroring her fractured ribs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Lena’s agency: tourist encounter forces redefinition of grief as "roots," culminating in palpable cost when she imagines a future where weight isn’t grief. Single tightening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: photograph becoming a "bird" and leaf replacing it reweights trauma without moralizing. Final line—"She would leave the rest to grow"—resonates as non-literal answer to "anchor optimism in realism."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in scent-driven noticing ("citrus and resin," "salt and ghost of foghorns"); rhythmic control peaks in fragmented closure ("The cypress swayed. The sea answered."). Zero head-hopping despite crowd presence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "fibrous with creases" and "fault lines of a world that broke" exemplify high-density prose. Final line’s cadence shift ("prune the deadwood... leave the rest to grow") avoids figurative muddle while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms trauma tropes via somatic specificity—henna on sister’s hands, fig-tree pruning as metaphor for grief. Emotional truth in "optimism was the quiet talent of meeting pain without flinching" avoids generic templates.</comment>
