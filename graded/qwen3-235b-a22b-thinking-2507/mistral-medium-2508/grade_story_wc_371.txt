<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora's "heuristically gentle" trait manifests in concrete micro-choices (replanting flagstones, pressing crumbs as question not offering), but baking the wheat with "a whispered guess" lacks visible struggle, slightly undercutting earned agency in pivotal action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the city stopping its adjustment ("coins felt like enough" after years of scarcity) reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens, where strangeness density forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The courtyard's overgrown soil (micro-setting) constrains Liora's pivotal choice (pressing crumbs) and charges closure as wheat replaces the fountain; recurring bread/wheat motif directly enables the final image of coins feeling "like enough."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure (bread → wheat → communal weeping) under the textural lens, but the oven's sudden activation lacks visible cost during the baking beat, slightly diluting the "meaningful tightening" requirement for 9.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: the final bakery sign's reappearance and coins "feeling like enough" reweight the opening's vanished bakery with resonant, non-literal answer to "tenuous absolution" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ordinary tilted askew," noticing vines curling *toward* the moon) persists under pressure; rhythmic control shifts from sparse tension ("The bread was warm.") to lyrical closure ("sacred had always been here...") without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("steam rising in the gray dawn as she broke it open"), but "unspooling like a memory she couldn’t place" slightly overwrites a pivotal sensory moment, risking clarity in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms magical realism tropes through specific stakes (coins feeling insufficient until now); "river running backward on Tuesdays" grounds strangeness in mundane detail, though the prince's return edges toward archetype without deeper complication.</comment>
