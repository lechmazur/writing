<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("grip on reality loose" vs. precise ritual) embodied through ink-dissolving thoughts and blurring edges; micro-choice of folding swan reveals hierarchy of witness over understanding with visible cost of self-dissolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis crystallizes when the keeper's edges blur while swan dissolves, making the cost of eternal witnessing legible through "breath shallow" and "face forgotten how to hold expressions" under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Obsidian refuge and origami swan constrain choice (only folding opens threshold) and charge closure: final swan's "wings sharp enough to cut" reweights the ritual as both weapon and surrender against the rising river.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pressure tightens through the library's groaning collapse and river's rise, narrowing options to pure witness; the keeper's endurance forecloses identity with felt cost in "edges blurring" and "breath shallow" under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "meaning was not something to grasp but to let slip like river silt," with final image of sharp-winged swan offering non-literal answer: witnessing requires self-dissolution without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("moss grew thickest," "river sighed") filters all details through keeper's embodied witness; rhythmic control in "water rising from stones only to vanish" modulates with the refuge's pulse under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; "crumbling pages hold them like a womb" achieves multi-job density (setting/character/emotion); minor overwriting in "regenerative silence" description avoids penalty through patterned payoff at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "keeper of lost knowledge" trope through irreversible self-dissolution; "origami swan as key" feels inevitable when wings "sharp enough to cut" reconfigure the ritual's purpose in the final image.</comment>
