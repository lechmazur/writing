<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Coachman’s motivation rooted in decade-long vigilance; embodied emotion via pulse quickening and parchment-burning; needle-passing choice earned by prior causality with visible cost (girl’s departure). Merchant’s thin characterization slightly undermines relationship dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options via fog lifts and silent gutters; conceptual cost undeniable in parchment burning and girl’s dissolution. Orientation clear by 80 words; Accumulative lens holds through patterned escalation (3→5 heartbeats) without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Yarn needle (micro-setting) charges closure as key; fog actively constrains crossing timing. Gutters’ ticking evolves from metronome to silent catalyst. Final image ("spindrift serenity") reweights fog’s meaning through prior particulars without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (crossing at precise moment) tightens through fog’s patterned lifts and gutter rhythm. Cost legible when gutters fall silent mid-crossing, forcing irreversible action. Agency lies in coachman’s "now" decision under Accumulative pressure, though merchant’s impatience lacks sufficient friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through needle/palimpsest as vessels for inherited wisdom; final image reweights "passing on" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by showing (not stating) cost via girl’s dissolution and warm needle. No tidy resolution—ambiguity lingers in "another traveler waited."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("listens with ambient awareness") shapes syntax; rhythm modulates via fragmented beats during fog lifts ("One."). No POV leakage; "tick-tick-tick" cadence embodies tension. Dialogue sparse but subtextual (merchant’s huff vs. girl’s thin "Wait").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("fog curled like a held breath" anchors voice/stakes). "Percolated" and "shivered" serve pressure without muddle. Final line’s "spindrift serenity" recharges fog motif with earned resonance. Slight register drift in "palimpsest promise" explanation (-0.1).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via yarn needle as key and fog as lock; specificity ("brass eye warm") avoids abstraction. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off with crystalline closure. Fresh inflection in gutters as live clock, though "distill complexity" motivation lacks grounding.</comment>
