<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "mended deception" motivation and embodied emotion ("breath curling around a marble"); elders' off-page change slightly blurs micro-choices but single-POV constraints justify focus on gardener's irrevocable stance crystallization with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: elders' silent kneeling beside the mended marbles crystallizes reconfigured stakes with conceptual cost ("ledgers stayed closed"), fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens through density shift in the vine-marble symbiosis beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Garden maze functions as active micro-setting: roots cradling marbles constrain choices, roses blooming "where she’d wept" charge the final image, and marbles' evolving role (broken → mended → shrine) directly shapes closure’s conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through gardener’s agency: polishing marbles becomes resistance against ledger pragmatism, with the elders’ "deficient" accusation forcing her decisive shrine revelation; cost is visceral in crushed shoots and the elders’ "doubt-flickered" silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through marbles’ transformation—final line ("small victories... worth commemorating") reweights "luck" without moralizing; the garden’s stubborn life ("wild and withering") embodies earned wisdom through concrete particulars, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in tactile lexicon ("pads of her thumbs," "hedges sighed"); rhythm modulates perfectly from meditative polishing to elders’ staccato dialogue; no POV drift despite lyrical compression teaching its pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("cracks gleamed like veins of silver" charges pressure); no figurative muddle in climax where buds "press against the cracks"—prose accelerates closure’s cadence shift while preserving clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "measurable luck" critique through gardener’s embodied resistance; marbles transform trope into indispensable symbol; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable by closure’s "roots cradle it like a secret."</comment>
