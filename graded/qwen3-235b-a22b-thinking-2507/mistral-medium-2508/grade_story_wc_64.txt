<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—tender gardener vs truth-bearer—drive choices under pressure; his recognition of the drowned husband’s scent via embodied memory ("He’d planted the man’s body") reveals hierarchy of values without therapy-speak. Widow Hester’s off-page presence limits relationship dynamics, capping near-9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: Elias resetting chess pieces crystallizes his stance ("the game wasn’t over") amid trembling marigolds and the silo’s final click, reconfiguring truth as ongoing burden. Accumulative lens holds through knot unraveling; cost ("weight of the case") legible on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cobalt silo actively pressures choices: Elias stands on toes to touch stars, its groaning ribs mirror unraveling secrets, and the door’s refusal to latch embodies hidden violence—finally clicking shut to charge the closure image. Environment constrains action and reweights meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through sensory accumulation: each knot’s unraveling narrows options (breath→scent→voices→vision), forcing Elias’s stance crystallization. Cost—bearing violent truth—is felt when the husband’s push vision dissolves, altering his approach to the widow’s knock. Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "knots" motif: "intentions were just knots waiting to be named" reweights the premise without moralizing. Final chess reset and marigolds curling like praying hands offer resonant answer—truth as cyclical stewardship—through concrete image, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: Elias notices through gardener’s lens ("soil darkens when turned," roots whispering secrets). Under pressure, syntax shortens ("Elias’s hands didn’t shake") yet retains texture; zero head-hopping. Voice modulates from blithe to soil-darkened resolve without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("lantern’s flame turned blue" conveys dread in 4 words). Rhythm varies from lush ("frayed thread pulled taut") to staccato ("Elias reset the pieces"). Near-flawless except "blithe nature not dimmed but deepened" risks abstraction, though quickly grounded by "soil darkens."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms cemetery tropes via verifiable specifics: sovereigns as river-payment, lamb’s ear plants, marigolds curling like hands. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes—Elias’s soil-darkened resolve feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Proximity check passed: no famous echoes.</comment>
