<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Liora's lie about fear versus her physical tremor; embodied emotion ("tremor in her ribs") and micro-choice (feeding coin despite risk) earn her final renunciation of burden with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably in "carry the weight differently now—not as burden but balance," with felt cost in her recalibrated stance; Accumulative lens holds through sensory/emotional density escalation to this crystallized moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Foundry's rain-washed crucible actively constrains choices (melting coin into light), while the zodiac coin's physicality charges the final image—her shadow "gilded at edges" proving environment shapes the closure's emotional weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when the coin "answers" the crucible, raising cost to "reduce her to ash"; Liora's agency in redeeming the experiment under Accumulative pressure makes the weight's transformation feel earned and irreversible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through "kintsugi intentions" motif—Veyra's scar theory reweights in Liora's final action ("learning which cracks were meant to stay"), avoiding moralizing while offering resonant, non-literal answer to "weight of names."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Alchemist's perceptual signature ("measuring her life," "transmute herself") infuses every observation; rhythmic control peaks in crucible tension ("If she was wrong...") with zero head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold—"rain hissed against hot metal" compresses setting/action into propulsion; "gilded at edges" reprises gold motif without muddle, charging closure with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms alchemy tropes through "kintsugi intentions" as professional philosophy made visceral; emotional specificity in "luminous regret" avoids generic weight metaphors, feeling inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
