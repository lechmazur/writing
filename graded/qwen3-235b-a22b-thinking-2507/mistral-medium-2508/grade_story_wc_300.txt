<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in hesitation versus duty; embodied emotion via trembling fingers and shifting shell text. Final choice earned by accumulated confessions with felt cost (pearl's dissolution), though minimal backstory keeps micro-choices slightly less layered than 9.0 demands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "pearl was gone... hands full of shells" crystallizes the cost (surrendering object for purpose) under Accumulative lens. Orientation anchors by line 3; pressure builds through shell confessions narrowing options to one irreversible act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Crystal caves function as micro-setting: their pulsing glow directly constrains movement and charges the final image ("sky streaked with swirling light"). Bioluminescent veins feeding on confessions make environment inseparable from thematic weight and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (weapon vs. method) tightens through shell confessions that progressively foreclose alternatives. Escalation driven by protagonist's agency—each buried shell deepens understanding until the crown choice—culminating in visible cost: the pearl's dissolution woven into the world.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "walls were never real" reweights the bunker's meaning without moralizing. Final image of confessions scattering as seeds offers resonant, non-literal answer to "dissolve the walls," avoiding thematic echo through embodied action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("electric air," "resonant hush" filtering urgency), but slight register drift in "She knew better" momentarily distances voice. Rhythmic control under pressure flawless; lyric compression taught early and paid off in closure's embroidery imagery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; "glow intensifying... as if feeding on the weight" risks mixed metaphor (light "feeding" on abstract weight) in a high-pressure beat. Final line’s specificity ("learning how to shine") avoids closure muddle but prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "magic artifact" trope via seashell confessions—fresh inflection where method replaces object. Emotional specificity ("I wanted to be seen") grounds universals; risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Derivative guardrail avoided through lived detail.</comment>
