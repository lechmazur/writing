<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through the boy's trembling hands and crumpled note; embodied shame ("how it coiled in the chest") avoids labels. Guardian's silent expertise reveals character via shutter-weaving micro-choices under pressure. Slight deduction for limited guardian interiority despite single-POV constraints.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: boy's eased shoulders and lighter pockets show earned stance crystallization under Accumulative/Textural lens. Rain erasing patterns mirrors emotional release with visible cost (abandoned note). Final star imagery reconfigures darkness as space for light—conceptual cost undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Dental mirror functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (only reflects light) and charges closure: father finding it transforms silence into listening. Canal's breath fogging air and rain erasing patterns actively pressure emotional shifts, fulfilling 9+ gate by charging final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (boy's need for absolution vs. shame) tightens through guardian's light-weaving, narrowing options to silent witness. Cost is visceral: crumpled note left behind alters tactics (boy walks lighter). Slight deduction as escalation relies more on environment than protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through starlight reconfiguration—"darkness wasn’t the absence of stars" shows rather than tells. Final explicit line ("Empathy didn’t need words") risks thematic echo penalty, but main narrative avoids moralizing. Resonant closure earned by prior particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in guardian's light-focused noticing ("shadows pooled between boats like forgotten promises"). Rhythmic control under pressure: short sentences during boy's arrival ("He didn’t turn. Instead, she began to weave") mirror tension. Zero head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "spiralingly calm" adverb risks overwriting but fits voice. One borderline dense sentence ("motionless as the reeds... drowned sunlight") earns minor deduction. Final line’s strategic telling ("darkness wasn’t the absence...") recharges motif without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dental mirror as empathy tool transforms medical trope. Specificity anchors universals: "cobalt dock," "stolen nails," father placing mirror in windowsill. Risk-taking (silent protagonist) heightens stakes without gimmickry—closure remains legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
