<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in Hollow's "cargo worth carrying" shift earned through embodied micro-choices (cradling spark vs. rusted badge), though flaw visibility slightly lacks pre-crisis texture; no diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis crystallizes when Hollow places spark in crate—visible cost in "tracks ahead were new" after reset, with Accumulative lens holding via dune imagery reconfiguration; cost proof in "sand was green" image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glowing dunes function as micro-setting charging closure: "sand parted" enables spark discovery, "sand was green" final image reweights the reset with environmental cost; bioluminescence constrains every action (e.g., "petals of light" guiding choices).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Hollow resets clock—agency-driven narrowing from "reset too many times" to carrying sparks, with felt cost in "tracks ahead were new"; escalation flawless under Accumulative lens via dune luminosity shifts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through dune/spark imagery reconfiguration: "sand was green" final line answers "cultivate sparks" without moralizing; avoids sentimentality by tying rebirth to concrete cost (erased tracks), not abstract hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "sand pulsed with bioluminescent algae" (professional observation) vs. "spark weighed nothing and everything" (embodied shift); no head-hopping, rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure ("train accelerated, dunes blurring").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops but minor overwriting in "petals of light unfurling" slightly dilutes momentum; otherwise flawless propulsion—"clock began to tick" accelerates tension without figurative muddle; final line’s "remembered" crystallizes closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Synthesizes time-reset tropes through "divergent archive" specificity—Hollow’s freight-guard lens makes "winding clock" feel inevitable; risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, closure image recharged via "sand was green".</comment>
