<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority excels with embodied emotion ("hands raw from threading needles") and micro-choices like tucking the shell, but the final shift to conductor lacks one concrete prior resistance to fortune-telling role, slightly weakening causality of closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: Li Wei's hands rising to "shape the air" crystallizes lifelong silence into artistic stance with visible cost (courier waiting, city's unmet expectations). Accumulative lens holds through ice's fracturing cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Frozen lake's mirror constrains choices by refracting time (mother's hands stopping, birthday), directly charging the final image where horizon "unzips." Glass spire amplifies breath into intrusion, making environment the active constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract until the ice groans; "homesickness as a when" lacks concrete pressure until closure. One meaningful deepening (silence as waiting) works but needs earlier tangible consequence of his unspoken music to elevate escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image reweights silence as "the space between notes where music lived," avoiding moralizing. "The shell wasn’t for hearing. It was for holding" delivers non-literal answer to central question through prior particulars, resisting tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "dawn unzipping itself from the dark" filters time through conductor’s lens. Rhythmic control peaks in "chuk-chuk-chuk" sewing machine echo, compressing stress without voice slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; "ink bleeding into treble clef" merges action/image/theme. Minor deduction for one filter-verb stack ("He remembered the last time...") in high-pressure beat, but no closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Trope transformation through specific cultural texture (baijiu, yuan, textile mill) and reservoir-drowned village. Emotional specificity in "homesickness as a when" avoids generality, making fortune-teller role feel irreplaceable.</comment>
