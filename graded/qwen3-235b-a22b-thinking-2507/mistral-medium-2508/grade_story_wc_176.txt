<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between preservation and release is embodied in "letting the names change," with micro-choices like dissolving the card showing earned endurance. Flaw: the regret over the last speaker lacks active struggle during the ritual, reducing contradictory impulses in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly with visible cost ("years she’d spent chiseling regrets from her own ribs" melting). Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 3. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density increase, though the "forgiveness" concept slightly edges toward tell in final lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ceremonial rope constrains every choice and charges the final image ("seamless again, its braids holding names like embers in snow"). Micro-setting functions as environment—its physicality drives the reconfiguration climax while weeping ice walls mirror emotional thaw.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving vs. releasing memory) tighten through Elira’s reconfiguration act, with felt cost in dissolving regrets. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via sensory density, but the "forgiveness" motivation lacks sufficient friction against her goal during the ritual’s escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment><question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the rope’s transformation, but "preservation wasn’t holding tight" risks thematic echo. Final image ("silhouette free of silence’s weight") resonates without moralizing, though the wind "answering" slightly over-clarifies the cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "wax and flame"-shaped observations; rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure ("Light bled... snowmelt ardor given form"). Zero head-hopping, with elision (off-screen speaker’s death) paid off through visceral regret.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "hollow it once filled" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor register drift: "snowmelt ardor" slightly elevates beyond caster lexicon in climax, but justified by ritual context. Final line’s breath/steady/heart light cadence masterfully resolves tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lost-wax casting with linguistic preservation transforms trope. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over causality) heightens stakes without gimmickry, but "silhouette free of silence" borders on familiar imagery despite fresh execution.</comment>
