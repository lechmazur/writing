<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses (rational historian vs truth-seeker) manifest physically (pulse vs calm actions) and through micro-choices like photographing the page. Callahan’s status pressure crystallizes in the "slack" face reaction when confronted with evidence, foreclosing his path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: discovery → threat → evidence reveal narrows options meaningfully. Closure (Earned Stasis) lands via Callahan’s "slack" face and the station’s transformation to "honest," with conceptual cost legible in the "gilded B to backroom handshake" pattern reweighting history.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ivy’s "strangling iron bones" actively mirrors the lie’s suffocation, while the rosebush’s final petal drop times the climax. Station constraints Elias’s tactics (shadows for escape), and the "crumbling, honest" final image charges closure through micro-setting specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake (truth vs protected faith) escalates through Elias’s agency: police threat → "parallels" evidence reveal forces Callahan’s stance crystallization. Cost is unmistakable in Callahan’s slack face and implied institutional unraveling, narrowing options decisively under causal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the Codex’s transactional ledger reweights "noble lies" without moralizing. Final image of "honest" station + tracks "leading nowhere" offers resonant, non-literal answer to truth’s cost, avoiding false equivalence by showing Callahan’s complicity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elias’s academic precision ("emotionally rational") contrasts with poetic observation ("ivy swallowed the past whole"), creating distinct perceptual signature. Dialogue modulates tension ("truth isn’t buried, it’s tended") with subtext, avoiding convergence even under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances plot or character (e.g., "B like held breath" serving both motif and Elias’s realization). Final line’s rhythm ("into the dark") modulates pressure perfectly, with no figurative muddle in climax beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of historian’s quest with modern institutional corruption via specific details (12th-century scribe → bank transfers). Transformation test passed: replacing "Codex" with generic "artifact" would collapse the conceptual cost of the illuminated B’s reweighting.</comment>
