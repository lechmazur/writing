<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines ("safety was just another word for shrank"), but father’s "empty" silence lacks sufficient development to fully motivate the final choice’s emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "bunker collapsed into itself" crystallizes irreversible cost under Accumulative/Textural lens with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: the doll’s evolving silence flavors constrain choices and charge the final image ("taste of beginning"), transforming object into environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by child’s agency—each gravity inversion deepens the "freedom vs safety" stake through tangible choices, with bunker collapse delivering undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through sensory particulars; "You were never the lock. You were the door" reweights the premise without moralizing, answering the central question through image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is revelatory ("silence tasted like honey and lightning"); elision of gravity inversions is pattern-taught and paid off in the final sprout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; peak-beat propulsion ("Not fly. Sprout.") maintains crystalline clarity while compressing complex transformation into visceral rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of "sprouting" and silence-as-substance creates inevitable emotional logic; risk-taking (gravity inversions) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
