<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority embodied through sensory language ("grief left raw," "steps measured by weight of languages") shows contradictory impulses (seeking silence while absorbing sound), but grief's origin lacks specific tactile memory to deepen micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly under Accumulative lens: "grief wasn't erased; it was mapped" crystallizes reconfigured stakes with undeniable conceptual cost, though celestial stillness device borders on convenient pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest functions as micro-setting that constrains navigation (sound-as-map), while compass ring charges the final image ("glinted once more... ahead"), fulfilling 9+ gate through environmental constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's sensory accumulation narrows options via celestial window ("only chance"), with cost legible in grief's transformation—not resolution—though constellations' mechanics slightly abstract the temporal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "melody was his now" offers resonant non-literal answer to navigating grief without moralizing, though the "remember" bone risks thematic echo but is redeemed by contextual integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("taste" of sound frequencies) and rhythmic control ("he didn't walk so much as unfold") sustain pressure; minor register drift in "uncovered" doesn't disrupt voice coherence under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion flawless ("salt for sorrow, copper for longing" compresses worldbuilding), though one scaffold sentence ("The constellations above had paused...") barely misses peak-beat artifact threshold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sensory mapping/grief navigation transcends trope via ultrasonic specificity; emotional truth anchors risk-taking, though stillpoint concept requires execution to avoid familiarity.</comment>
