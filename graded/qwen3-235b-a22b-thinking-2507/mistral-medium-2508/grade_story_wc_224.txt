<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via embodied micro-choices (tracing feather impression, tearing page), but the twelve-year-old backstory block slightly summarizes without altering present tactics. Final endurance earns cost through "mercury churning, silver turning to storm."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias writing in the ledger crystallizes stance with undeniable cost ("pain of remembering wasn’t the past. It was the future"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly; the stone’s shift from loss to "possibility" reweights meaning through textural density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The bookstore-mountain setting actively constrains choices (false wall location, trembling shelves enabling door), with the stone’s "cracked atlas pages" pedestal directly charging the final image of empty shelves waiting. Environment shapes every tactical shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens is masterful: glyphs shifting → map of hollows → realization language is "seeded" tightens the buried-talent stake into irreversible action. Cost is unmistakable in the mountain’s groan and Elias’s storm-churning eyes during the seed act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "language wasn’t for speaking. It was for planting" reweights "buried talents" without moralizing. Final image of writing on shelves offers resonant answer to "shape of home" via the feather-key-him triad, avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("glyphs shifted when he blinked," mercury residue) controls rhythm under pressure. Voice modulates perfectly from wistful ("dreams where the mountain was a throat") to urgent ("He tore the page free"), with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; high density with "silver turning to storm" compressing emotional cost. Minor scaffold in "leaving behind faint silver streaks—residue... price" slightly dilutes immediacy, but final image ("hollows inside him") avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of "buried talent" as plantable language avoids cliché. The bookstore-mountain frame offers fresh angle, with "unsaid" ledger transforming tropes through specific stakes. Risk-taking (textural escalation) heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
