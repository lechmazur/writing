<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via taste-metaphors ("acrid burn of fire" vs. "buttery richness"), but fear of mediocrity remains backstory rather than complicating the fruit-slicing choice. Final renunciation of critics' approval is earned through planted sensory history.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "ruins couldn’t contain" crystallizes the greenhouse’s transformation. Minor causality slip with "synaptic plasticity" mention not dramatized in action, but textural escalation through memory-infused growth beats holds under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse constrains choices (soil for planting, space for broth service) and charges closure via "vines climbing rusted beams." Final image makes "ruins" motif indispensable, though occupational tools lack integration beyond soil.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (creating beauty from failure) tightens through fruit’s growth, but city opposition remains declared ("critics called gimmick") without on-page test during peak action. Cost legible in "patience" requirement and ruined past.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through broth served in chipped bowls, not moralizing. Final "quiet rebellions" list reweights premise via concrete image ("ruins couldn’t contain"), avoiding stated morals while charging prior decay with hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("air tasted sweet and electric"), but "synaptic plasticity" jarringly breaks chef’s lexicon. Rhythmic control falters only there; otherwise, compression teaches pattern early ("glass panes cracked like old man’s hands").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold; every line advances texture ("skeletal remains of dead vines"). "Synaptic plasticity" register drift in high-pressure beat costs 0.2, but final line recharges "ruins" motif with perfect propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of culinary magic realism: "tasting memories" trope transformed through feeding homeless, not fame. Transformation test passed—swapping "chef" for "painter" breaks broth’s logic. Slight derivative echo in knowledge fruit concept.</comment>
