<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied micro-choices ("whispered, 'The way my father’s hands shook'"), avoiding stock epiphanies. Slight deduction as skepticism-to-belief shift lacks sufficient on-page struggle during the terminal scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: sculptures rearranging + "science was the language of faith" reconfiguration carries undeniable conceptual cost. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds perfectly through sensory density shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tower’s rain-slick stone and amber fly constrain choices (tracing grooves, dissolution into veins), charging the final image. "Rainwashed and empty" door with dual footprints exemplifies micro-setting driving closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("Where do you belong?") tightens through Elara’s agency: her whispered answer unlocks the hologram, her touch triggers the tower’s tremor. Cost legible in "sculptures rearranged" and irreversible departure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment>Thematic resonance emerges non-literally through "stars remembered the shape of her hands," avoiding moralizing. "Homesick universe" concept deepens via concrete particulars (weeping sculptures, father’s hands) without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("stone skin slick with memory," "voice like rain on bronze") persists under pressure. Rhythmic control peaks in terminal scene’s fragmented sentences that mirror emotional urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ozone and old paper" shows high-density propulsion. Minor deduction for "breath fogged the metal" (template cadence) in high-pressure beat, but closure remains razor-sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "pilgrimage" trope through chemical specificity (microbiomes, E=mc²+memory). Risk-taking (lyric structure, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "homesick universe" feels inevitable.</comment>
