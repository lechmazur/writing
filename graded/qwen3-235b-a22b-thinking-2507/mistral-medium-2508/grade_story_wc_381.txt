<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "She had failed. Or so she thought" and embodied cost of searing cold, but "solitude pressing in like a second skin" edges toward abstraction without sufficient concrete micro-choices during collapse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost ("lighter" wing, prophecy becoming "a sigh"), but the reversal from shattered failure to success lacks tight causal anchoring in prior mechanics—cost proof hinges on fragile "lighter" detail without deeper setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Brook actively constrains choices (moonlight-dependent ritual, dawn deadline) and charges closure through "tattered, glowing" wing holding "silence that could breathe," with origami evolution from tool to skeletal lattice to final reprise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation via accumulative density—ripples to shattered shards to tranquil blaze—driven by her net-weaving agency, with visceral cost (burned skin, clenched fists) making stakes feel earned despite minor abstraction in "unspoken fears."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: "smoothed hush" evolves from abstract goal to tangible "silence that could breathe," with final image ("the silence would remain. And that was enough") reweighting fear without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("terrestrially cosmic tension," "edges bled silver") modulates rhythm under pressure, though "solitary no longer" slips toward authorial intrusion rather than embodied realization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high-density lines like "a lattice of light... half-remembered constellation" propel triple-duty imagery, with rhythmic control in climax ("lunged... slipped... searing") avoiding figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms prophecy tropes through specific mechanics (origami mapping silence), with risk-taking Earned Stasis ending heightening stakes—synthesis feels inevitable via "stolen secret" shards and tranquil blaze resolution.</comment>
