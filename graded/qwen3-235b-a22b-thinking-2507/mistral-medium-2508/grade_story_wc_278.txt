<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("hands shaking not from fear but knowledge") and embodied guilt (rib-coiling static) power the climax; micro-choice of pressing tattoo to amber reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("guilt and grace share the same air"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density escalation (static → rain) but "firmware roots" metaphor slightly muddies causality at peak tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Amber constrains choice (feeding paper/cracking) and charges final image (singing wings); Pleiades tattoo shifts from scar-map to active guide, embodying thematic constraint without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes ("hush dissonance" vs. "pay with witness") tighten through firmware’s betrayal; escalation via protagonist agency (feeding paper) creates irreversible cost (amber crack), but secondary guilt ("cry not yours") lacks visceral testing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: ledger imagery reconfigures guilt as debt requiring witness; final singing wings offer non-literal resolution without moralizing, resisting tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("constellation inked across forearm," "fishing line through water") reflects scientific grief; rhythm modulates from static-hiss to heartbeat-quiet under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops with high density ("mosquito’s legs dusted with centuries"), but "firmware roots burrowing into cracks of mind" creates minor metaphor clash in climax beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms haunted-machine trope through guilt-as-debt mechanics; Pleiades-to-singing-wings synthesis feels inevitable, with risk-taking (Accumulative closure) heightening emotional truth without gimmickry.</comment>
