<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in playing "not for statues... but for the thing inside her chest," though competing impulses lack deeper friction during climax. Embodied emotion strong ("bare feet sinking into damp earth"), but motivation remains singularly focused without meaningful internal trade-offs that would elevate to 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: statues melting into soil with "slow, relentless work of uprooting" creates undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—density increase (locust shell pulse to hatching swarm) reweights beauty's cost. No orientation debt; drive lens clear by midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Locust shell functions as micro-setting, constraining choice when pressed to chest to signal trees and charging final image ("tucked into the crook"). Brass roots strangle life while sap-weeping tree enables rebirth—environment directly shapes tactics and closure with visceral specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through violinist's agency: heartbeat signaling narrows options to one irreversible act. Cost crystallizes when statues "melt" into soil—conceptual price of rebirth is visible. Tightening occurs at "crack split the earth," but secondary stake (personal liberation) lacks sufficient friction against primary goal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "resonantly soft" petals blooming amid brass—a non-literal answer to "world forgot how to be beautiful." Final image of "first true blossom" reweights mechanical oppression without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite "tarnished wonder" tone; cost is felt in "slow, relentless work."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "wind howled through enchanted orchard" filtered through musician's ear. Rhythmic control under pressure ("She played louder, not with her hands...") modulates with emotional intensity. Zero head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early and paid off in locust swarm's "shattered stained glass" flight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "transparent wings catching light like shattered stained glass" avoids purple prose through precise textural purpose. Final line’s "where the future was already blooming" delivers propulsion without muddle. Minor synonym churn ("resonantly soft" → "soft and crimson") prevents 9.5.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "statues melting" trope through brass-root stranglehold and heartbeat signaling. Emotional truth in "violin no longer warped by time" avoids generic rebirth. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes, but "orchard exhaled" slightly edges toward familiar lyricism, blocking 9.0.</comment>
