<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("method was refusal") and embodied emotion ("hands shook when sketching") drive the bridge choice; self-forgiveness earned through prior causality of alluding to truth without naming guilt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably at "turned right" with cost in the erased graffiti line; Accumulative lens holds through graffiti density shifts, with the bridge reweighting the dominant stake of self-forgiveness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Ivy actively constrains movement ("platform swallowed by green"), while the bellows as micro-setting charges the final image; the cracked earth riverbed directly alters Elias' tactical choice at the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation via graffiti density ("third bridge" revelation) forces stance crystallization; the cost of turning right (abandoning maps) is visceral in the "cracked earth" and "ivy parted" reconfiguration under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "river remembers what you burned" graffiti reweighted at the bridge; final image ("path wasn’t on any map") offers non-literal resolution without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite sister’s letter.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("sunlight in jagged patches illuminating graffiti like a code") reflects chronicler’s eye; syntax compresses under stress ("He’d been both, once") without disrupting voice coherence or focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fog as second skin" metaphor integrates seamlessly with action, while "boots crushing ivy" shows textural specificity that propels momentum without figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms guilt tropes through hydrological specificity ("chronicler mapping rivers but never learning to swim"); the bellows-as-scar motif synthesizes profession, trauma, and forgiveness in an inevitable yet fresh arc.</comment>
