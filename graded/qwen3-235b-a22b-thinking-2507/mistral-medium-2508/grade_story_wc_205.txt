<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's contradictory impulses (revolutionary fury vs poetic tenderness) act simultaneously in scene; his "revision" motive compels the shard reconstruction with embodied cost ("shard was dust"). Taelis's gasp reveals her worldview cracking without diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "shard was dust" and archaeologists' "uneasy knowledge" crystallize the reconfiguration. Accumulative lens holds throughout—storm density and shard fracture narrow options to one decisive act with felt stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The crystal shard constrains choices (must reconstruct lattice) and charges the final image (dust on altar). Time-strands "thick as rope" pressure movement during the storm, evolving causally from "glowing embers" to vision-weavers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Taelis interrupts: "tampering with dead culture" vs "letting it speak" forces Elias's decisive act. Shard fracture narrows options to one pressure point, with visible cost in the dust and archaeologists' altered perspective under Accumulative escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through time-strands as "memories of a people who tried to burn the future," avoiding moralizing. Final line "it was beautiful... and it was his" reweights time's visibility as sacred without stating a moral, resisting "temporal anarchy" simplification.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's poetic precision ("tangled, glowing web") creates distinct perceptual signature; storm preparations reveal character-specific noticing. Taelis's dialogue carries academic subtext ("This isn’t possible") with lexicon matching her role under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "strands thick as rope, pulsing with memories" achieves high density. Final line's rhythm ("it was beautiful... and it was his") crystallizes closure without figurative muddle in the peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "archaeological dispute" trope via visceral time-strands and "burnished sorrow" tone. Vase shard's refraction physics ties to theme organically—no stock metaphors, with emotional specificity in Elias's hunger for "revision" over vengeance.</comment>
