<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (obsession vs. erasure) drives closure; embodied emotion in "thumb smudging residue into skin" shows character-specific struggle without therapy-speak; final renunciation earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increase ("ambered hush" evolution) reweights silence as map with undeniable conceptual cost at "last star blinked out"; orientation perfect within 40 words; cost legible in dissolving into the map.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ridge fort’s pocked stones absorb the defender’s vigil, constraining Eldrin’s mapping method; gold leaf literally flakes onto skin, charging final image; micro-setting (booklet) actively shapes every choice toward closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Timeframe (one star fading) tightens pressure into meaningful deepening; protagonist agency in retelling silences directly creates the erasure insight; conceptual cost of dissolving self is unmistakable in "no longer a man but another layer of quiet".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete acts (smudging gold residue), not abstraction; final pebble shift reweights silence as memory without moralizing; avoids thematic echo while offering resonant answer to "how to map endless night".</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "ambered hush" as tactile concept; rhythmic control mirrors ritual ("voice was not a sound but a shape"); elision of second character taught early with purpose; zero POV drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; "gold leaf clung like gilded snow" demonstrates high density without muddle; strategic telling compresses transit; final line’s "pebble shifted" recharges opening with precision; no artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms oracle trope through specificity (pebble-shore, mapping absences); "silence as wound or cradle" synthesizes familiar concept with fresh emotional calculus; risk-taking in making silence the active force pays off in closure.</comment>
