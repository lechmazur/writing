<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora’s embodied contradiction (“I never left” vs. knowing it’s untrue) crystallizes in the punch imprint. Micro-choice of pressing stamp into palm reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost. Flaws (duty avoidance) compound into inevitable renunciation without safety-hedging. No diagnostic label-speak in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: “the courage that waits is not the kind that propels you forward.” Accumulative lens holds—density peaks as punch arcs into shallows, reweighting “unused courage” via visceral loss. Wind’s intervention complicates but doesn’t resolve; cost legible in “leash had broken, but the current was still there.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ticket punch constrains every choice: its weight guides Liora’s traverse, the star stamp charges the final image (“stamp the dusk itself”). Ridgeway’s “veiled” quality pressures tactics—waiting where “light is thinnest” directly alters her stance. Sensory hierarchy (salt, damp wool, creaking wood) mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (courage for staying vs. going) tightens through Liora’s agency: her question to the silver-braided woman forces crystallization. Escalation via accumulative density—vigil fires’ stubbornness, water’s “gently persistent” lapping—reweights stakes as she realizes unstamped tickets “teach us.” Cost is visceral: punch’s loss = professional identity surrendered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image (“some things are meant to remain unticketed”) reweights the premise without moralizing. Theme emerges through ticket punch’s evolution: from tool of propulsion to symbol of withheld courage. “Most important crossings are the ones you don’t make” crystallizes via concrete particulars (unstamped slips, ridgeway’s pause), avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature (“ridgeway breathed,” “twilight deepening like a held note”) filters all detail through Liora’s liminal state. Rhythmic control peaks as short clauses (“She raised the punch. The star caught light”) mirror tidal urgency. No head-hopping; dialogue (“You’ve come back”) carries subtext via idiom (“tended by keepers of the threshold”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density (“leash of duty snapped” compresses backstory into active metaphor). Final line (“let the twilight hold her”) recharges “shoreline lullaby” with earned stasis. Minor overwriting in “path twisted like a held breath” (-0.1) but no closure muddle—punch’s *plink* crystallizes cost with tactile precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms “threshold keeper” trope via ticket punch’s specificity: star stamp reweights courage as active waiting. Emotional truth in “unused courage had been here all along” avoids generic templates. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry—ridgeway’s “veil” makes universals feel lived-in, not abstract.</comment>
