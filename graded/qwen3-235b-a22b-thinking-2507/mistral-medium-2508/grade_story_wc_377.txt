<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (preserving truth through inevitable destruction) drive every choice; muteness isn't labeled but embodied in vibration language. Final renunciation of permanence—gathering fragments for next sculpture—carries visible cost: "the sound would be perfect" only through shattering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "a thousand tiny bells where there had been one" reconfigures truth as scattered seeds. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—the ice thinning to "Morse code of light" tightens options until the release, with "child’s gasp" crystallizing the stake’s fragility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The iceberg fragment constrains choices (precise angle placement) and charges the final image: "blue-green flash... surrendered to the air" makes wonder’s temporality visceral. Sensory hierarchy masterful—stiff fingers, silk sails, and "glisten from within" filter urgency through Liora’s vibration-focused perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation via accumulative density: ice "thinning with each strike" narrows options toward shattering, with agency clear in Liora’s "knew the moment." Cost is unmistakable—"release" requires fragmentation, proven when "remnants" dissolve against her palm, altering her next action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "wonder was best heard in the spaces between sounds" avoids moralizing. Final image ("wind played the empty air") resonates as non-literal answer—truth preserved through transience—without stating a moral, reweighting the "symphony" as tuning, not performance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "language of vibration: the *ring*... *shiver*," with rhythm accelerating during shattering ("Liora exhaled. The sculpture began to turn"). Zero head-hopping; elisions (no backstory) taught early and paid off in closure’s sensory immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold—every line multiplies meaning: "fracture through the ice, not a crack of breaking, but a bloom" avoids cliché while advancing plot. Final line "tune the world to hear it" crystallizes theme without abstraction, with zero figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis: "truth" as ice-carried sound transforms familiar tropes through specific mechanics (copper chimes, brass spiral). Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes—wonder’s cost is its ephemerality, proven when "last fragment dissolved," avoiding safety-middle hedging.</comment>
