<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "You're not mine to keep" amid calcifying fear; embodied emotion ("bones whenever sorrow pressed") avoids labels. Final endurance earned by grotto's pressure, with visible cost in transformed shadow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands when Elira realizes "she was the loom," reconfiguring her role with undeniable conceptual cost ("hush settle inside her as cradle"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds through starlight dissolution beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bronze grotto functions as micro-setting constraining choice—lamp flame must align with cracks to calcify burdens. Final image ("shadow walked beside her") charged by prior tactile use of walls and starlight needlework.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen when grotto itself presses weight ("heavier than others, older"), narrowing Elira's options from release to absorption. Cost legible in trembling hands and the hush becoming her cradle, not trap.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "loom" realization reweights burden-bearing without moralizing. Final image ("singing... carrying weights they no longer remembered") offers resonant answer to "who holds sorrow?" through embodied action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "fractal weaver" physiology and "whalebone harp" singing. Rhythmic control under pressure via fragmented syntax during calcification ("ice fracturing... flaking away like rust").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density in "grief thick as kelp / rage sharp as chisel." Slight register drift in "boundary-lessly trapped" (label-heavy) but doesn't dull closure's starlight dissolution beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms sorrow-bearer trope through specific mechanics (calcifying via flame orientation). "Loom" twist feels inevitable via prior particulars; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry ("hush" as sediment).</comment>
