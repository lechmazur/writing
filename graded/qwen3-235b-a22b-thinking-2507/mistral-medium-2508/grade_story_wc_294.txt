<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (thief vs philosopher) embodied in cage-bar touch and lira handling; final renunciation earned by father's spiral lesson with visible cost in cigarette flick. No diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options through "didn't wonder what came next" with undeniable cost in relinquished need for resolution; Accumulative lens holds via patterned reweighting of train/money. Orientation clear by para 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lion cage bars constrain choice (Elias's realization about time's pressure) and charge final image (shadow on tracks); foreign money evolves from desk object to "secret no longer needed" in closure. Micro-setting essential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cyclical vs spiral paths) deepens through cage-bar discovery, narrowing options to acceptance; cost legible in released cigarette. Agency drives deepening under Accumulative lens without causal turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through train/cage/money motifs; final "proof" crystallizes without moralizing. Avoids false balance—Elias's insight earned through concrete particulars, not abstraction. No thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct ("dusky harmony," "lira thin as confession"); rhythm modulates from long reflections to clipped closure lines. Reflections anchored to physical cues (desk/cage) without POV drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop in "train had stopped. And his father had come back" (-0.3); "perceptively calm" register drift (-0.2). Zero closure artifacts; propulsion flawless in final beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "returning to roots" trope via startup graveyard contrast; "spirals not circles" insight feels inevitable through cage/train parallels. Specific details (yen/francs) prevent generality.</comment>
