<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction underdeveloped during pivotal choice to leave; "recognition" lacks competing impulses. Embodied emotion strong ("breath hitched," "arms burned") but micro-choices lack value hierarchy at departure moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "silence... felt like an invitation" crystallizes stance with cost ("wing dissolved"). Accumulative lens held through iridescent pattern; dissolving wing proves tangible cost in final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Floating rock functions as active constraint (suspension bridge exit) and charges closure ("mist thickened, but... carried sun trails inside"). Micro-setting (morpho wing's physical decay) directly alters final image and tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake tightening through agency: painting "until arms burned" shows earned cost, while "cracks in people" realization reweights options. Visible price (dissolving wing) charges final image under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "cracks... needing color" image, avoiding moralizing. Final "map of stories he would never tell" offers resonant non-literal answer to "why magnetize stories?" without stating thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless: dye master notices color shifts others miss ("cobalt to violet to warning gold"). Rhythmic control under pressure ("The ink *moved*") with zero head-hopping; voice modulates from wonder to quiet certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dissolved like sugar in tea" exemplifies textural specificity. Figurative language ("voice the texture of crushed petals") serves character without muddle, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes transplant trope with dye master's sensory lens: "stories needing color" feels inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric closure, conceptual cost) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "iridescent caution" transformed through specific craft.</comment>
