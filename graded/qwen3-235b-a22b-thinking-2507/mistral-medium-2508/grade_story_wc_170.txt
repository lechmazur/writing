<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (creating hope for others while avoiding self-reflection) drive her final renunciation. Embodied cost: soldier's aching ribs and her empty pockets crystallize the trade-off, though his consequence feels slightly detached from immediate pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: vanishing after bells swallow light with "pockets empty" showing visible cost. Orientation anchors within 15 words ("terrace stretched..."), lens (Accumulative/Textural) held rigorously through refracted rainbows fading as final image reweights the mirage premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (cracked mirror with peeling silvering) constrains choice by forcing ritual completion before bells toll. Final image ("terrace held nothing but scent of spring") charges closure through environment's tactile decay, making abstract cost visceral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through deepening: heartbeat payment tightens pressure as it unravels, narrowing Liora's agency to walking away. Visible cost (soldier's aching ribs) alters tactics, though physical consequence for Liora could be more embodied during peak ritual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "peeling silvering like old skin" reweights hope's fragility. Final image offers non-literal answer to "cost of mirages" without moralizing, embracing complexity through Liora's empty pockets and the soldier's ghost-dream.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("rainbows that bled," lullabies "bent just slightly sharp") modulates rhythm under pressure. Minor deduction for "perceptively calm" intrusion, but voice stays consistent through deep third POV and sensory hierarchy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; sentences like "she pressed her palm to its surface and felt... heartbeat unravel" achieve triple duty. One borderline overwriting risk ("fractured rainbows that bled") but redeemed by payoff in fading closure image. No artifacts near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "magical helper" trope through specific mechanics (heartbeat payment, coded lullabies). Emotional truth in self-denial ("let the mirror slip before it showed her own face") avoids sentimentality. Fresh angle: hope as theft with irreplaceable tactile details.</comment>
