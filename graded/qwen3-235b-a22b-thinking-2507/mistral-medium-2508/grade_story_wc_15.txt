<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete weaver’s craft ("sewed with memory") avoids therapy-speak; contradictory impulses ("haunting optimism" amid ruin) manifest when touching stone without fear. Lacks secondary character to test relationship crucible, but single-POV baseline excels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "shadow stretching long and winged" crystallizes stakes with visible cost ("bones aching"). Accumulative lens holds through "stitch" motif; orientation clear by 80 words. Minor cost proof ambiguity in "drowning man" simile.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Red stone canyon actively constrains choices (dead ends blooming into arches) and charges final image ("shadow stretching winged"). "Copper-tasting air" and brine-slick walls filter through weaver’s tactile POV, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when labyrinth shifts via Elias’s touch—agency-driven under Accumulative lens. Cost legible in "bones aching" and irreversible wharf transformation. "Drowning man" simile slightly dilutes cost proof but final image reweights stakes decisively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "mending ruins" actions, not statement; final whisper reweights loss without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo via concrete "ruin to sacred" carvings. Earned resonance through loom metaphor’s organic evolution from wharf to labyrinth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fingers tracing grooves," "salt-worn ropes") sustains voice through sleepwalking. Rhythmic control shifts from lyrical ("half-remembered hymn") to urgent ("stepped forward—not into depths"). "Older knowing" risks abstraction but quickly recovers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; "veins of red dust rose like embers" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor scaffold in "older knowing" disrupts concrete flow. Closure beat ("shadow stretching winged") flawless—no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "mending ruins" trope via weaver’s sleepwalking-as-creation. Emotional specificity in "haunting optimism" avoids generic templates. Risk-taking (labyrinth as loom) heightens stakes without gimmickry; proximity check passed.</comment>
