<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elira's "balancedly curious" trait is stated not shown, violating label-only rule (-0.4); strong embodied emotion in chain handling but lacks contradictory impulses during pivotal horizon-unfolding moment, missing 9+ requirement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Flawless Accumulative closure as Charged Poise ("how to rise" crystallizing cost of limited perspective), but aliens' convenient return resolution violates "coincidence may complicate not resolve" (-0.7), undermining escalation integrity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Chain link (micro-setting) constrains choices and charges final image as "bridge/lever," but benthic city remains atmospheric backdrop without pressuring decisions, missing 9+ gate requiring environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early with Kael's "not meant to go there" cost, but escalation relies on Elira's monologue about spiral horizons rather than protagonist-driven deepening; agency shifts to alien knowledge, weakening pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Unfolded horizons" concept stated directly in Elira's map description ("guide to what lay beyond"), triggering thematic echo penalty (-0.6); final image reweights chain sufficiently but avoids earned resonance through concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bioluminescence refract through rusted gaps") with rhythmic control, but "balancedly curious" register drift breaks POV lexicon; otherwise clean focalization and voice modulation under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>One paraphrase loop near aliens' introduction ("unfolded from trenches... had always been there") triggers -0.2; otherwise exceptional density and propulsion, with zero figurative muddle in peak horizon-unfolding beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh benthic navigation angle transformed by specific chain-link mechanics, but "key waiting to be turned" trope lacks irreplaceability; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry (+0.3).</comment>
