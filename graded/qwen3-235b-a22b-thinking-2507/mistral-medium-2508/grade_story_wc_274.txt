<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown via falsified logs vs hidden discrepancies; embodied emotion in "pulse scandalized the stillness." Lacks contradictory impulses during climax decision—choice feels inevitable rather than conflicted despite prior setup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost (death) and conceptual repricing ("archives spoke back"). Accumulative lens holds via snow/silence density escalation. Minor deduction: letter's warmth slightly convenient for triggering action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Library actively constrains choices (soundless environment necessitating written communication) and charges final image ("snow kept falling. The library kept breathing"). Snow evolves from "shroud" to witness, meeting 9+ gate requirement for environment shaping closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through atmospheric pressure (alarms "distant, then louder") not causal turns. Cost (execution) is visceral and legible in final beat. Agency clear via command input; dominant stake (truth vs erasure) reconfigured by dormant networks' awakening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars (copper-ink smell, false logs), not abstraction. Final image reweights "contraband truths" without moralizing. Slight thematic echo in "Martyr" terminal text prevents 9.0 despite strong resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("vaulted halls swallowing sound") with rhythmic control. Stress compression lacks nuance—the execution scene maintains lyrical density instead of shortening syntax. No POV leakage; voice modulates effectively until climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in closure beat but minor paraphrase loop: "breath fogged the glass" repeats at words 112/158. High density maintained ("sinking into silence—deeper, warmer") though "dizzying quiet" told not shown. No figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms dystopian tropes via specific archive mechanics (pneumatic tubes, cryo-pod logs). "Blink after surprise" timeframe innovatively tightens stakes. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative lens) heightens coherence without gimmickry; snow-library setting avoids genericism.</comment>
