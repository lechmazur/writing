<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: forgiveness held alongside unforgotten hollow, embodied in rough hands and scalloped scars. Final choice to seek "the source" earns through prior causality—dawn fig tree ritual directly informs her rejection of "fragile peace." No therapy-speak; grief's shape understood via bandage-scalloping motion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "understood its shape—how it scalloped the edges of joy" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds—escalation via density (bioluminescent moss pulse, vine recoil) not plot mechanics. Cost proof: "grief was less" inversion shows irrevocable shift in perception.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grotto functions as micro-setting constraint: moss parting enables shoot plucking, vines recoiling alters tactics. Hairpin’s scalloped edge becomes shoot’s color and final bandage motion—environment charges closure. Sensory hierarchy impeccable: caregiver’s hands note texture before light, earth smell anchors rebirth concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief’s relationship to rebirth) tightens through Maren’s agency: "I want the source" declaration forecloses peace-seeking. Escalation via Accumulative lens—pressure grows as moss pulses, vines curl, until shoot dissolves "like wine into water." Cost crystallized in violet-sky realization: grief now "feeds the roots of what came next."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: scalloped patterns (hairpin, shoot, bandage) reweight rebirth without moralizing. Final image—scalloping bandage edges—"answers" central question by showing grief’s necessary role in joy. Avoids sentimentality; "hollow it carved" keeps complexity intact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: notices textures (rough hands, scalloped scars), earth smells before light. Rhythmic control peaks during climax—"She didn’t hesitate. She plucked it."—compressing diction under pressure. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally as moss parts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; every line advances story: "umbral vines curling over stone arches worn smooth by centuries of wind" compresses history into texture. Final line’s clockmaker metaphor avoids cliché through specificity ("slow, kind hand"). Figurative language sparse but precise—"grief scalloped the edges of joy."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms rebirth trope via caregiver’s physicality: twilight shoot, scalloped grief, silver fruit "heavy with choices not yet made." Avoids spiritual cliché by grounding in bandage-scalloping motion. Emotional truth in "grief was less... because she finally understood its shape"—fresh inflection on forgiveness.</comment>
