<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (duty vs curiosity) manifest in embodied micro-choices like playing to widen the breach; final step forward earns endurance with visible cost. Child's voice as externalized doubt slightly edges toward convenience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: driftwood settling into new patterns crystallizes the stance shift with undeniable conceptual cost ("mountains remembered"). Pressure builds through textural accumulation (laughter → flickering child) under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thunder-Echo Range's silence actively pressures choices (e.g., "avalanchingly quiet" enabling the laughter's impact), but micro-setting (flute) more directly constrains the final image. Range could further alter tactics beyond atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias's agency: playing to widen (not seal) the breach crystallizes the stake shift from "keeping out" to "following." Cost is unmistakable in "stopped fighting the tide" as the weave "breathed easy."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Final image of driftwood pointing "back—or perhaps, the way forward" offers resonant, non-literal answer to "What if you’re wrong?" without moralizing. Theme emerges purely through particulars; no thematic echo or abstraction dilutes the charge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("frost-bitten earth," "laughter thin and distant"); rhythm modulates under pressure (short clauses during tension). Zero head-hopping; voice remains anchored in Elias's embodied experience through closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "avalanchingly quiet" exemplifies fresh, purpose-driven diction. Minor abstraction in "slow unraveling of his own certainty" quickly embodied by driftwood arrangement—no closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms fantasy tropes via specific, grounded choices (relic keeper harvesting insights, weave as loom). Emotional truth in Elias's doubt elevates beyond novelty; "some doors were meant to open" feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
