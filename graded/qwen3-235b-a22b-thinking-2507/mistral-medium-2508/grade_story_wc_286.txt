<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "sharp gentleness" and phototropic kindness manifesting in concrete choices (embedding glass, reading shadows). Final renunciation of repair—"not for rain, not for repair—but for someone to notice"—earns cost via embodied remembrance, avoiding epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost in "resistance wasn’t refusal. It was remembrance," reconfiguring the wasteland’s meaning. Accumulative lens holds flawlessly; bee’s arrival deepens stakes without causal convenience, though its gold-dusted wings flirt with symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting (lantern glass shard) constrains choices—clay "drank the shard," altering the bowl’s final glow—and charges the closure image. Sensory hierarchy excels: "ghost of honey" and "acrid tang" filter through potter’s urgency, avoiding checklist repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding resistance) tightens via the bee’s thrum deepening into "a string plucked in a room he couldn’t see," forcing his choice to embed the glass. Cost—emotional labor of remembrance—is legible in "resistance was remembrance," though chimney smoke’s role feels slightly under-tightened.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the bowl’s transformation: "only visible in the cracks" crystallizes without moralizing. Final image (bowl glowing "as if lit from within") reweights resistance as active remembrance, avoiding thematic echo via concrete particulars like honey-tasting air.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature dominates ("glaze shimmering like last breath of a dying star"), with rhythm modulating under pressure—shorter clauses during bee encounter. Zero POV leakage; "phototropic" abstraction saved by tactile execution ("hands rough from clay and patience").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "wax combs bleached white by relentless sun" layers atmosphere and stakes. Minor register drift: "phototropic to kindness" risks conceptual abstraction, but "thrummed one last time—soft, insistent, like a pulse" recovers with rhythmic propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pottery, beekeeping, and time fractures avoids tropes—e.g., "fractures where time had split like wet clay." Specificity elevates: "pale gold" bee wings mirroring lantern glass creates inevitable resonance without forced symbolism.</comment>
