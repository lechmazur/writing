<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction (mathematical precision vs. moral urgency) drives her micro-choices under pressure; embodied emotion (“throat tightened”) avoids therapy-speak. Girl’s late entrance slightly undermines causal motivation for partnership despite thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost (debt systems collapsing); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through ink-pot escalation. Minor causality hiccup: girl’s coffin entrance lacks prior spatial anchoring.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mortuary prep room functions as micro-setting: embalming table constrains Lira’s posture, ink pot’s serpent etching charges final image. “Porcelain surface streaked with ghosts of names” exemplifies tactile specificity that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (twelve lives) tightens relentlessly through Lira’s agency; each erased name narrows options with escalating cost. “Twelve for *her*” revelation crystallizes moral calculus without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ink-pot mechanics: “debt could drown” reweights fairness as collective action. Final line (“numbers didn’t add up to her. They added up to *them*”) offers non-literal answer without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (“streaked with ghosts of names”) filters setting through Lira’s con-artist lens; sentence rhythm accelerates during name-erasing sequence. Slight register drift in “math of a fair trade” phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; “ink *pulled*, sucking the name” demonstrates syntactic variety and propulsion. Minor overwriting in “thick as blood, swirling when she tilted the pot like it was alive” (redundant simile).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms con-artist trope via mathematical morality and funeral-home alchemy. “Ink pot shattering” reconfiguration feels inevitable yet fresh; avoids safety-middle by embracing chaotic resolution over tidy redemption.</comment>
