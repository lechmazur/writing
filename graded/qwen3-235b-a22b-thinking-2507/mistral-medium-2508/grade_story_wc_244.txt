<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's pragmatic interiority shines through concrete micro-choices (fixing radio, trading bread for stories) and embodied emotion ("desperate jocularity" during Mira's approach). Motivation rooted in logistics-as-antidote to collapse compels her pivotal decision to pass the moon rock onward, though deeper flaw exploration could elevate endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable conceptual cost: "The world was a ledger, and for once, she wasn’t the only one keeping score" crystallizes the shift from isolation to reciprocity. Accumulative lens holds through density escalation (rumors, offerings, freight car discovery) without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ivy-choked station constrains every choice—from Lena's glass-crunching entry to Carter's kudzu-sealed freight car—while the moon rock charges the final image as it's reimagined ("meteorite," "saint’s bone"). Sensory details like "camphor and old paper" filter through Lena's logistical precision without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Lena's methodical usefulness (radio fix, rheumatism diagnosis) narrowing options until Carter's ledger reveal reframes the "cure." Her agency in passing the rock carries conceptual cost: the realization that connection requires surrender, not possession. Accumulative escalation perfectly calibrated for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—railroad ledgers as antidote to loneliness—avoiding moralizing. Final image of someone turning over the moon rock reweights the premise without stating a moral, making the cure's essence ("in the passing") resonate through action rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Lena's logistical gaze ("specializing in aid that arrived just after cameras left") with rhythmic control under pressure: fragmented syntax during the freight car discovery ("Dr. Carter was not a virologist") contrasts with flowing cadence in the reflective closure. Dialogue carries subtext without ventriloquism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances story with surgical precision ("smooth as a river stone, cold as a promise" ties object to theme). Final line’s minimalist cadence ("Not today") avoids sentimentality while charging closure. Minor abstraction in "desperate jocularity" redeemed by contextual embodiment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms moon rock trope through railroad ledgers as "cure," avoiding gimmickry. Emotional truth in loneliness as "gnawing absence that made people stop answering doors" synthesizes logistics and myth into singular vision. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without clarity loss.</comment>
