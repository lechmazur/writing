<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's interior contradiction ("caution warring with hope") drives pivotal choices; embodied stress in "thumb hovered over transmit switch" avoids label-speak. Final renunciation of cosmic pawnhood earns stakes via prior calibration efforts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost: campus divisions become "scars" proving survival, reconfiguring cosmic tension. Accumulative lens holds as signal's shift from predatory to curious reweights human agency without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Radio station's micro-setting constrains every choice (locked doors, outdated equipment); astronomical charts charge closure as "inked stars shift" during signal change. Sensory hierarchy masterfully narrows under pressure to static's "teeth-aching" hum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Liora's subsonic gambit: campus arguments falter mid-sentence as cost. Single escalation suffices—frequency adjustments narrow options from observation to interference, reweighting "divisions as wounds" to "scars" with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through signal/campus fracture parallelism; final image ("divisions like scars") offers non-literal answer to cosmic testing without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo via embodied stakes: "unspoken" thrum proves earned resilience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "static hissed like angry stars" reflects signal-interpreter bias. Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure ("third pulse... arguments faltered"), with elision ("three nights ago") taught early and paid off in calibration stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "cautiously hopeful heart pounding" edges toward label-speak but avoids full diagnostic phrasing. Otherwise high density: "charts fluttered as ventilation kicked on" integrates setting/action without loop artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic horror and academic politics: "academic integrity memos" as cosmic fault lines transforms tropes. Risk-taking heightens stakes via subsonic frequencies—a specific, non-obvious tool that avoids gimmickry while charging closure.</comment>
