<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Reed’s embodied motivation (“bind the village together in the looking”) and contradictory impulses (solitude vs. connection) manifest through micro-choices like tracing the tag; Syl’s underdeveloped causality slightly undermines secondary pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the final reconfiguration of “lost languages” into “invitation” carries undeniable conceptual cost through the hum’s “ache of recognition,” with Accumulative lens held flawlessly from the orchard’s first hum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and Shimmer Crater actively constrain choices (search timing, path lighting); the reeds’ “hollow stems” and obsidian’s “sharpness” charge the final image by embodying kinship’s fragility and beauty.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Reed’s agency: her solo search deepens the dominant stake (belonging as action), with felt cost in her relinquishment of chasing Syl, crystallizing under the Accumulative lens via the village’s handprints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through tactile particulars—the violet tags evolving from “I was here” to “We are here”—avoiding moralizing; the final line reweights kinship as active invitation without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Reed’s sculptor POV filters all perception (“obsidian rippling with trapped starlight”); rhythmic control under pressure (“She decided then to find Syl, not for answers, but for the search itself”) avoids lyric excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; every phrase serves multiple purposes (“the paint still faintly warm” implies immediacy, foreshadowing, and thematic warmth); no figurative muddle even in high-pressure beats like the dedication.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms kinship tropes through specific, grounded details (reed-scarred hands, obsidian’s “sharpness”); the “luminescent ache” tone avoids sentimentality via physicality (“hum of the crater answer back—not with words, but with the ache”).</comment>
