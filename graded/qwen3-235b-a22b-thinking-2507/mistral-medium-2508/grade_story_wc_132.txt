<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory impulses (scientist vs. surrenderer) act simultaneously in pivotal microscope scene; final leaf-handoff choice earned by abandoned notebook and physical stakes removal with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options ("don’t tell it how to grow") with undeniable cost—abandoned notebook, surrendered control—under consistent Accumulative lens where sensory density drives realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Wet soil and linden leaf constrain choices (barefoot surrender, microscope analysis) and charge final image where "she couldn’t tell where the storm ended and she began," fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Liora’s agency—her decision to pull stakes reconfigures the nursery’s future under Accumulative pressure, with cost legible in abandoned scientific ritual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Final image of dancing leaves and open arms reweights "storm as invitation" without moralizing; theme emerges solely from concrete particulars like cellular reconstruction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("serrated edges still damp," "waxy resistance") remains consistent under stress; rhythmic compression ("Her hands shook") heightens pressure without clarity loss.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "rain fell harder, blurring lines between her skin and the mud" achieves high density with visceral propulsion, no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "nature epiphany" trope through specific botanical metamorphosis; emotional truth in Liora’s struggle avoids sentimentality while risk-taking (scientific framing) heightens stakes.</comment>
