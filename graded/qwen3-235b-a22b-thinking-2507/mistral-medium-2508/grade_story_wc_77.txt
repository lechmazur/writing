<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via embodied micro-choices (loosening clasp mid-lie, letting filmstrip burn) but advisor's off-page influence slightly blurs motivation causality at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly—the puddle wink crystallizes stakes with visible cost ("refusal to flinch" foreclosing photographic curse) under Accumulative/Textural lens; luminance density peaks with earned cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Funhouse setting actively constrains choices (mirror absorption enabling the lunge) and charges final image (puddle reflection); "burnt sugar/copper" specificity filters Lysander’s sensory decay under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency (filmstrip retrieval forcing dissolution) with felt cost (enduring whispering advisor), but "tricking fear" motivation lacks one tangible middle-beat sacrifice scaling to climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through visceral particulars ("fear is a lockpick" reweighted by wink) avoiding moralizing; final "bed itself" metaphor reconfigures fear’s nature without stating thesis, resonating via charged closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("silvered surfaces warping the dark like a lung") modulates rhythm under stress; non-standard punctuation (em-dashes, fragmented clauses) taught early and paid off in climax’s propulsion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density ("He lunged. Not at it—through it" compresses action), but "razor dragged across glass" slightly strains physical logic in high-pressure beat, muddling auditory metaphor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms carnival trope through photographic curse specificity; "puddle wink" reconfiguration feels inevitable yet fresh, with risk-taking (lyric structure) heightening stakes without clarity loss.</comment>
