<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices (withdrawing vial vs. "not here to take") and sensory specificity ("bitter, metallic, stuck to roof of mouth"); final renunciation of burden earned through prior causality with visible cost in "clean" taste.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably—"Clean. For the time in weeks"—with felt cost under Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation anchors by paragraph 2 ("desert fortress," "Chef Elias," "tonight’s was bitter"); lens clarity held through "pavilion sighed" reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting of coral pavilion constrains choice (kneeling to pour memory) and charges final image ("shadow stretching long and thin"); tidal pools function as recurring object charging closure through "clean" sensory shift, satisfying 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias’s agency (preparing/smothering memory) narrows options to ritual act under Accumulative lens; cost legible in "clean" taste and lifted weight, though pavilion’s passive resolution slightly softens protagonist-driven pressure at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (sandpapering memories) not abstraction; final image ("taste like salt and redemption") reweights premise with conceptual cost without stated moral, perfectly satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in chef’s sensory lexicon ("sharp as citrus," "burnt caramel"); rhythmic control under pressure ("cold, then not, then him") with purposeful elision taught early, meeting 9+ quick test despite minor tense consistency blip.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "moon hung too low, too heavy" exemplifies high-density propulsion without figurative muddle; final beat ("knife no longer warm") delivers closure with crystalline clarity, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chef/memory-tasting avoids tropes through specific lived detail ("vial amber glass, stoppered with wax"); risk-taking with sensory metaphor heightens stakes but slightly over-ornaments "fossilized grief" description.</comment>
