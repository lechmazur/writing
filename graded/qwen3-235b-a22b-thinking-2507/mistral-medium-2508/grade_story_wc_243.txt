<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in peak beats; resolve to "stitch laughter back" feels unwavering despite bitterness. Strong embodied emotion ("bitterness became part of her" via tea metaphor) and micro-choices (tracing photo) anchor motivation, but internal conflict remains singular under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("covenant was breathing") lands with undeniable cost: locket snaps shut "like a sigh" while vellum carries "weight... like a weapon." Accumulative lens holds perfectly—density of ink/violet motifs reweights preservation stakes without causal breaks. Orientation clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Jetty actively constrains choice: groaning wood mirrors time’s pressure, violets’ fading blooms charge the final image. "Salt-bleached wood" and "ink-dried shadows" aren’t backdrop but tactical resources—environment shapes every action from kneeling to tracing, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through proximate causes: tracing the locket photo forecloses passive mourning, with cost felt in "bitterness became part of her." Agency tightens options via single meaningful turn (inking vellum), though moral calculus lacks competing goods. Lens-perfect escalation for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: "stubborn green of things that refused to be forgotten" answers the covenant question without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—no character states the thesis. Final jetty image reweights "broken" into "breathing" with conceptual cost (memory as weapon/gift).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("twilight bled into harbor... color of old parchment") reflects archivist’s ink-stained worldview. Rhythmic control under pressure flawless—long sentences for reflection, clipped lines for action ("She stood"). Minor deduction for "haunted by what could have been" bordering abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "lap of waves... rhythm like a heartbeat" does triple duty. Near-deduction for "bitterness became part of her" (borderline label-speak), but tea metaphor saves it. Final line’s "stubborn green" achieves textural specificity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via specific craft: walnut ink from "the tree he planted," violets as "whispered confessions." Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off—the jetty’s renewal feels earned, not gimmicky. Emotional specificity ("weight of small moments like a relic, like a weapon") avoids generic templates.</comment>
