<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's interiority is concrete and sensory-driven ("scent of her grandmother’s house fading"), but lacks contradictory impulses; her quiet contemplation dominates without visible internal conflict. Micro-choices like arranging the spiral reveal character, yet no competing values strain her stance under pressure. The closure choice feels earned but misses Q1’s 9+ requirement of simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orientation is anchored by paragraph 1 (who/where/when clear). Closure lands as a valid Charged Poise: the final image of her "steps fell softer" reconfigures the stake (alive houses as listeners) with conceptual cost (irreversible perceptual shift). The "You’re close now" voice slightly strains causality but doesn’t break the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The bay micro-setting actively constrains choice: displaced objects shape her ritual, and the teacup’s "trembled, then stilled" directly charges the closure image. Sensory details (orris scent, damp wood) are selective and urgency-filtered, avoiding symbolism while mirroring internal shifts through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation is subtle but coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens: the shard’s activation narrows options to acceptance (streetlights flicker, door clicks). Cost is legible in her altered perception ("air tasted different"), though agency leans passive as the bay acts upon her. One tightening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through particulars—the orris shard’s function reframes silence as active listening. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("some houses felt alive because they had learned to listen") without moralizing, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("things shifted... slow creep of the familiar turning strange") and rhythmic control elevate pressure; long contemplative sentences tighten into crystalline closure lines. No head-hopping, and elision (attic backstory) is taught early and paid off in the ritual’s meaning.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythm purposefully ("She knelt... where the tide had left behind"). Figurative language serves meaning without muddle ("scent... like the first moment before a held breath"). Final line’s "steps fell softer" crystallizes closure with unparalleled density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "magical object" tropes through grounded sensory work (orris root’s texture, displaced objects). Emotional specificity in her quiet realization avoids sentimentality. Freshness lies in redefining silence as living presence, though "hush" concept has faint echoes of existing literary motifs.</comment>
