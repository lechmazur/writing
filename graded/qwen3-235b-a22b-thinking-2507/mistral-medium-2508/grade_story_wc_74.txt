<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority excels through embodied detail ("hands remained steady," "exhaled slow and methodically hopeful"), but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses—his hope never wavers under pressure, missing Q1 9+ gate. Micro-choices like tracing "rouse/forgive" glyph reveal values, though flaws don't compound meaningfully.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the vanished leaf and worn brush prove kindness remembered, with conceptual cost legible in "the leaf was gone." Accumulative lens holds—glyph accumulation reweights "strangers remember kindness" stake through the fig tree's rebirth and dawn writing, fulfilling Q2 9+ test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse constrains every choice: the dying fig tree's new leaf forces the climax ("began to write the child’s laughter"), and the worn brush charges the final image. Environment shapes tactics (writing on leaves, not canvas) and closure, satisfying Q3 9+ gate decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via Accumulative pressure—child's laughter crystallizes his hope into action—but the cost (worn brush, vanished leaf) feels conceptual rather than visceral. Agency is passive acceptance of the fig tree's gift, limiting escalation's emotional weight despite coherent lens alignment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through image: "began to write the word for 'dawn'" answers whether kindness persists without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by embedding wisdom in the fig tree's rebirth and brush's wear, fulfilling Q5 9+ test through resonant closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exquisite ("air tasted of green things," "static of sleepless souls"), with rhythm modulating tension (short clauses during the glyph pause). Zero head-hopping; compression of time ("forty-three nights") is taught early and pays off in the dawn closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "moon-tipped brush" evolves meaning without muddle. One slight artifact: "smooth and unmarked, waiting" borders on generic phrasing in a high-pressure beat, costing 0.3 points despite otherwise flawless propulsion and density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms insomnia tropes through the fig tree's biological urgency and lapis ink's materiality. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over causality) heightens stakes coherently, with the dawn glyph feeling inevitable yet fresh—exemplifying Q8 9+ synthesis.</comment>
