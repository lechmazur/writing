<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Liora's motivation as an ignorance cartographer is concrete and consistent, with embodied choices like kneeling to find the fissure. However, lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; her fear of overstepping resolves too cleanly without layered emotional conflict beyond the single hesitation moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds—the spire's song reconfigures options with felt cost (fear of rejection overcome by coaxed future). Drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density increase in the ink's transformation, though the "hour when future is malleable" isn't actively pressured beyond initial setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The obsidian spire and frozen lake constrain every choice: ice as "ledger" forces Liora's kneeling search, while the spire's hum dictates timing. The kingfisher quill's final image ("spark" for innovation) charges closure, fulfilling 9+ gate via micro-setting as active constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (future rejecting boldness) tightens when wind howls and ice groans, narrowing options to endurance. Cost is visceral in Liora's "fear she had overstepped," but the timeframe ("before pen meets page") isn't leveraged as active pressure beyond thematic setup, missing full escalation potential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through action: "planting a question in fertile ground" crystallizes the central concept without moralizing. Final image ("footprints... not the last") offers resonant non-literal answer to innovation's cost, avoiding abstraction while embracing ambiguity about the map's impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "kingfishers dove before they saw water’s surface," reflecting Liora’s predictive nature. Rhythmic control deepens under pressure ("ink spread like a bloom... veins of silver"), with zero head-hopping and voice modulating from clinical ("ledger of choices") to lyrical ("flock of starlings").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, but "groundedly imaginative" feels slightly abstract in a high-pressure beat. Minor cadence repetition ("a network... a city... a path") risks template rhythm, though saved by concrete verbs ("threading," "winding"). No closure-dulling artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms prophecy tropes via specific constraints: comet-ink’s "thick with potential" and spire’s vibration ground abstraction. Emotional truth in "innovation was never about control" avoids genericity, while the ignorance cartographer premise synthesizes fresh angles on mapping possibility through tactile details.</comment>
