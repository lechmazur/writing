<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through concrete actions (thread to lips), but princess remains underdeveloped despite pivotal role; Elias' contradictory impulses—grief vs. purpose—earn closure through prior causality with visible cost ("the absent who needed their stories told").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "healing was not a place, but a direction" crystallizes options with conceptual cost; accumulative lens holds as sensory density escalates toward Elias' epiphany about his purpose, with thread/locket discoveries narrowing his understanding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Garden functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (thread guides to locket) and charges closure ("thread would be his compass"); autumn’s breath actively moves vines, making environment inseparable from the final image’s reweighting of absence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias' agency—following thread to locket—and deepen knowledge ("he left because the sea promised answers"); cost is legible in his transformed understanding, though escalation lacks one visceral pressure point beyond sensory accumulation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "spaces between departure and return," avoiding moralizing; final triplet ("Like the thread. Like the tide...") reweights absence as continuity without stating morals, earning resonance through prior particulars rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sails swallowing the horizon like a sigh") and rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping, with voice modulating from melancholy to purposeful through syntax shifts like the final fragmented cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; high density with propulsion ("thread grew warm... pulsing like a heartbeat"), but "lonesome splendor" risks thematic echo—mitigated by later transformation into active metaphor for Elias' journey.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "obituary writer" trope through specific grief-cartography; thread/locket mechanics feel inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking (lyric structure) heightening stakes without gimmickry, avoiding derivative pitfalls via concrete ritual.</comment>
