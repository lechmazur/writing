<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in misinterpreting "dawn" versus the child's correction, but sister's absence limits emotional depth despite the resonant final image of "time's absence." Flawed competence in gear resistance ("gummed with memories") grounds her, yet the high-stakes closure lacks fully embodied cost for the lost sibling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "she felt like the key" crystallizes her transformation with undeniable cost ("sister's hand, a lunar shadow"). Orientation is immediate ("frozen library"), and the Hybrid lens (causal repair/accumulative texture) holds through the child's prophecy correction driving the decisive turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The frozen library's ice actively constrains action (salt-stiffened boots, scattering gears on ice) and charges the final image—"mirrors wept silver" as the hall shudders. Micro-setting triumph: the water-mirror isn't backdrop but the clock's heart, forcing her to reach inside to retrieve the watch.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through gear-by-gear agency: the second gear's resistance ("gummed with memories") narrows options, and the child's correction forces a trade-off (reinterpreting "light"). Cost is legible in the final image—"the quiet space between what was lost"—but the sister's physical absence slightly blurs the felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: "mending what moonlight broke" becomes "the shape of time's absence" in the watch. No moralizing—only the final image reweights time as mending, avoiding "thematic echo" while resonating with the locksmith's profession and loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful: "breath curled like old ink" and tools "worn smooth by decades" filter all observation through her craft. Rhythm modulates under pressure—terse sentences during the gear insertion ("She reached in. The water didn’t resist.")—with zero head-hopping or lexicon drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels: "ripples spread like cracks in a prophecy" merges image and causality. Final line "a lock worth turning" recharges the opening's "mended what moonlight broke" without muddle. Minor deduction for "burnt sugar and old storms" slightly overwrought in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "locksmith" trope through time mechanics: the hall as a broken clock synthesizes profession and theme. Risk-taking with lyrical compression pays off—the "child" reflection isn't gimmick but essential to the prophecy's misinterpretation, making the rescue feel inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
