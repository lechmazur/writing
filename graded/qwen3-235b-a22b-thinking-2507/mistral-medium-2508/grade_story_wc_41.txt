<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction manifests physically (trembling hands while running toward danger); final renunciation of search tactics earned through tape's revelation with visible cost (snapping arrows). Avoids diagnostic labels under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes when Elias stops searching; cost legible in "he didn't need to locate anything anymore" with arrows broken. Accumulative lens holds as fog/tape density tightens stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Driftwood arrows (micro-setting) constrain choices—aligning with fog parting, then snapped at end. Seawater in weeping sculpture's eyes charges final tide image where "waves hissed like static," reweighting the sea's role.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when sculpture moves—Elias runs *toward* it, not away, escalating agency. Cost crystallizes as he snaps arrows, abandoning his search method. Pressure accumulates via fog/tape hum without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: tape static becomes sea sounds, chalk dust replaces futile spirals. Final line "sound of growing older was just the sound of the sea" reframes longing without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "air tasted like static" and "fog parted like held breath." Rhythm modulates under stress (short "Something older." sentences), then resolves in lyrical final cadence without POV drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "static" motif recurs purposefully. Final line "He left the chalk behind" crystallizes closure with surgical precision. No figurative muddle even in high-pressure beats like the sculpture's movement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "prophet" trope through specific mechanics (chalk spirals, driftwood arrows). Emotional truth in "precognitive forgetfulness" avoids cliché; tidal longing reframing feels inevitable yet fresh in hindsight.</comment>
