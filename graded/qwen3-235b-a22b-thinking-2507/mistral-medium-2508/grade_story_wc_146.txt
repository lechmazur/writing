<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Limited interior contradiction; "infinitely patient" trait shown through deliberate steps but lacks simultaneous conflicting impulses under pressure. Embodied emotion strong in physical toll ("legs ached") yet final choice lacks earned moral ambiguity beyond endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: "the work was not done" crystallizes refusal to abandon revival with visible cost (exhaustion, fragility of "for now"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory escalation to the child's laughter, with archway's groan proving tangible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cobblestones function as micro-setting that constrains choice (deliberate footsteps) and charges closure ("cobblestones warmed beneath his boots"). Tuning fork's physicality ("weight heavier than it should have been") directly enables revival mechanics without ornamental symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist's agency: archway's groan forces "quickened pace," while warming cobblestones narrow options by raising collapse urgency. Cost is visceral in "legs ached" and the fragile "for now" of the archway's survival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of balance emerges purely through action: "scales felt even" reweights the tuning fork's physicality into philosophy without moralizing. Final image ("child’s laughter... street that had known only silence") offers non-literal answer to revival's cost, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("dust of forgotten things," "pulse of a heart remembered by earth") with rhythm modulating under pressure. Near-miss: "infinitely patient" risks telling but is redeemed by concrete action ("steps growing surer"). No head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "the town beyond the arch was a skeleton... its breath the wind" slightly stalls momentum. Otherwise, high density ("a resonance so low it wasn’t heard but felt") and strategic fragments propel the piece. No loops in climax beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms revival trope through sound-as-repair: footsteps as metronome reconfigures "balance" from abstract to embodied craft. Specificity ("ebony fork smooth as still water") avoids generic ghost-town clichés while risking lyricism that heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
