<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (leave vs. tend roses) resolve in earned endurance; embodied cost in "neither did she" forecloses escape path with visceral weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance with undeniable cost: "neither did she" against the wind’s pressure reconfigures options through endurance, fulfilling Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Dome’s glass fissure and roses constrain every choice; final image charged by "spiderwebbing" crack held by sandbag patch, making micro-setting indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Accumulative escalation via sensory density ("thrum of roots," "fissure didn’t spread") narrows options to endurance; cost legible in isolation as world burns outside the dome.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through "stitch it into the dome’s seam"—reweights "engraved quiet" from memory to active resistance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("thorns against palm," "roots drinking deep") modulates rhythm under pressure; elision of father’s backstory taught via sandbag cue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; "spiderwebbing fissure" and "thrum of roots" achieve high density without muddle; final line "one thorn at a time" crystallizes propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of apocalypse tropes: tending roses as resistance feels inevitable; "desert rose farm in glass dome" specificity avoids generic nowhere setting.</comment>
