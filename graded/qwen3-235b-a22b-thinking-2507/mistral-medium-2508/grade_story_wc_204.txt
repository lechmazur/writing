<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias realizing "the system was him," but micro-choices lack visible stakes escalation during the press operation; his calm during library dissolution feels unearned given prior tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "Awake" etched in frost crystallizes the cost of dissolution with conceptual weight, and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through frost patterns' evolution to rupture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choices—the frost patterns dictate action, liquid time ink enables the press, and glass library's dissolution charges the final image; "rivulets" and "starlight" reconfigure prior fragility with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elias's agency: unstoppering the bottle despite warnings tightens options, and the visible cost of library dissolution ("glass walls running like wax") reweights reality's negotiability with undeniable conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</comment><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through "rustling awakenings" text and final dissolution, avoiding moralizing; but "the library was never meant to float forever" slightly overstates the conceptual repricing's earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("frost and memory" bindings, "whispers unspooling") reflects Elias's trade, with rhythmic control tightening during press operation; no POV drift despite lyrical compression of the rupture moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "liquid time, siphoned from moments" exemplifies high-density propulsion, though "compressing eternity into a single, fragile page" risks abstraction but is redeemed by tactile follow-through.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms library tropes through specific mechanics (frost-pattern rupture, whisper-pressing) and emotional truth in Elias's realization; risk-taking (conceptual dissolution) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
