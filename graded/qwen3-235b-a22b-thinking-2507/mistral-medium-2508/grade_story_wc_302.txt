<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her dual role as documenter and subject of the watch’s theft; embodied cost in trembling hands and the final heart-as-door shift makes the earned renunciation visceral without label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: "she stepped forward, and the path appeared" crystallizes her stance with conceptual cost (library’s dissolution), holding the Accumulative lens through sensory density buildup to the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The watch’s brass casing functions as micro-setting, constraining her urgency ("burning against her ribs") and charging the final image with reversed hands catching light—a persistent constraint shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by her agency: tearing the page accelerates the library’s collapse, narrowing options to a single sprint; cost is unmistakable in the dissolving shelves and watch unraveling her own silences mid-escape.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through the library’s physical dissolution and the stolen page’s pulse; "Some things only needed to be said" reweights the premise without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "breath curling like ink" and "shelves warping"; rhythmic control peaks during the vision snap with staccato phrasing that mirrors her fraying control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances momentum ("The mist pressed closer, hungry" compresses threat and atmosphere). Final line’s propulsion ("she stepped forward") recharges the opening mist with earned hope.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "unspoken words" through the library’s bone-parchment books and propagation delays; risk-taking (watch as time-thief) heightens emotional stakes without obscuring clarity in the closure beat.</comment>
