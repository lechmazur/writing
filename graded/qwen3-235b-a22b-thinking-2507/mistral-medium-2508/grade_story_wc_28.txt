<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (steel bones vs. cradling mercy) drives choices; embodied grief in broken fingers and warming stones; commander’s kneeling reconfigures relationship with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance ("mercy isn’t what you burn") with felt cost (broken fingers, son’s name); Accumulative lens holds as tile-naming pattern intensifies pressure toward commander’s shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mosaic tesserae constrain choices (renaming method) and charge final image (cracks filling with gold); sensory specificity (charred cedar, cobalt blue) evolves with emotional shifts without static cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when commander appears—Elias’s naming forecloses escape path with visible cost (clattering sword); "aberrant mercy" reweights options through protagonist’s action, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete acts (naming tesserae), not moralizing; final image ("cracks filled with gold") reweights "mercy" as carrying loss without stated moral; avoids false balance (rulers’ cruelty unredemptive).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("calloused fingers tracing chipped patterns") filters all detail; compression of retrocognition via sensory echoes (bread scent, laughter) avoids summary; dialogue subtext ("Then I’ll be in good company") carries goal pursuit.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; high density ("the plaza held them both, cradling sorrow in arms of steel"); minor register drift in "retrocognitively trapped" (clinical vs. lyrical voice) in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mosaic-as-memory vessel transforms trauma trope; emotional specificity (Aisha’s smile on cobalt shard) avoids genericness; risk-taking (quiet climax) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
