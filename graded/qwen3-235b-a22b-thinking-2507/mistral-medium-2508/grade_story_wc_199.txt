<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Liora’s motivation (decoding seeds’ stories) drives action, but internal conflict lacks depth; micro-choices like prodding the moonstone twice reveal values without contradictory impulses under pressure, slightly weakening causality for closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost (Liora’s transformation into tree-like form) under a clear Accumulative/Textural lens; the arbor’s roots forming a ladder reconfigures options with visceral stakes in the final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ashen arbor’s roots directly constrain choices (forming the ladder) and charge the final image (grove of saplings); environment specificity—like seeds that "sing"—shapes every pivotal turn without generic placeholder details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens: leaf runes and monument activations tighten pressure through Liora’s agency (building the seed tower), culminating in her irreversible transformation with visible cost (bark-dappled skin) that forecloses her human identity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transformation as cyclical renewal emerges through concrete action (eating the leaf, becoming part of the grove), avoiding moralizing; the sapling’s "begin" reweights the central question without stating a thesis, earning resonance through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("seeds that sang," leaves spelling runes") modulates under pressure; purposeful compression (e.g., "the hush was an inhale") is taught early and paid off in closure, with zero head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; lyrical density ("iridescent as a dragonfly’s wing") serves momentum without muddle, though one borderline figurative cluster ("prophecy tangled like vines") risks slight dilution in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seed-sorting as prophecy work avoids tropes; the arbor’s sentient logic feels inevitable, with risk-taking (lyric escalation) heightening stakes without gimmickry—transformation test passed via irreplaceable seed-tower mechanics.</comment>
