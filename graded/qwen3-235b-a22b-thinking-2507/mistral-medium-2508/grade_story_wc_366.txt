<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elias’s reticence manifests in concrete micro-choices (burning letters, pocketing glass) rather than labels; his contradiction—craving connection while resisting vulnerability—peaks when he stops returning the sea glass, embodying the earned endurance of isolation with visible cost in "throat tightened."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "The skiff would rot at the dock. Let it" crystallizes his abandonment of escape, reconfiguring the dominant stake (safety vs. connection) under a consistent Accumulative/Textural lens where stone-spiral density intensifies pressure toward this stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The stone spiral constrains every key choice (returning glass, writing replies) and charges the final image—"stones humming like a choir"—proving environment as active pressure; tactile specificity ("sea glass smooth as a held breath") filters setting through Elias’s embodied need for tangible proof of survival.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency: passive recipient of letters → active stone-stacker → initiator ("build a door"), with the skiff’s abandonment as felt cost; the spiral’s mechanics (perfect ring, humming stones) reweight safety as shared labor, avoiding abstract stakes via concrete tradeoffs like pocketing the glass.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action, not assertion: "safety wasn’t the absence of storms, but the hands that passed the light" earns resonance via stone-stacking and sea glass, while the final image ("stones humming") reweights the premise without moralizing, embracing complexity through ghostly keepers’ unresolved absence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Elias’s taciturn voice ("mist like a man tracing a scar," "smile that didn’t need sound") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control shifts from clipped precision to lyrical flow as connection deepens, with elision (mother’s river rocks) taught early and paid off in the spiral’s mechanics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold—each sentence multiplies meaning ("stones fitted so tightly they hummed" conveys both tension and hope); figurative language serves character ("sea glass warm as a pulse") without muddle, and the final line’s cadence ("the light wasn’t. And neither was he") crystallizes closure with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse tropes via specific mechanics: the stone-spiral cipher echoes his mother’s river rocks, making the resolution feel inevitable; emotional truth in quiet surrender ("For the first time, so did he") avoids sentimentality through grounded details like salt pork crates and rusted lantern air.</comment>
