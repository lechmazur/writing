<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "curse and gift of driftwood" realization; micro-choice to carve a hand (not beast/saint) earns closure with visible cost in sacrificed driftwood. Slight underdevelopment of "perpetually learning" trait in early beats prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: empty pockets vs. remembered weight, charged by the final boat image. Accumulative lens holds perfectly through layered temporal visions. Cost proof solid in "hands remembered the weight of the carving."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Archway functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (carving location, path revelation) and charges the final image (stone sliver in boat). Salt-crusted stone and turbine-hum pressure tactics relentlessly. Environment gate fully satisfied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation via deepening understanding (slide's layers → archway as loom) forecloses survival-focused path for connection. Cost visible in sacrificed GPS/driftwood and altered tactics (carving hand). Agency-driven under Accumulative lens but minor early stake ambiguity prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: violets in crevice, rusted nail scratch. Final boat image reweights "timewoven alliances" without moralizing. Avoids Thematic Echo penalty by staying visual—no character articulates the thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("choir of lost things," "turbine-hum") modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control in climax ("light spilled out—not forward, but *sideways*"). Zero head-hopping; elision of ferry backstory taught early via GPS failure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; "winking out like a dying star" is sole minor artifact (slight cliché). Propulsion flawless: "He pressed the lantern to the arch" accelerates into climax. Final line recharges archway motif with "sliver of stone" specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "magic object" trope through coastal specificity (preserved violets, rusted nail). Emotional truth in "we were here" scratch avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (archway as loom) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
