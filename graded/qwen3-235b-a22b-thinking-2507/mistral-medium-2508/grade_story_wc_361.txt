<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines through "lingered in villages stretching encounters" but "heart hammering" borders on bodily cliché; final choice to plant seed earns closure via prior causality with visible cost of mentor's dissolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands impeccably: "the mentor’s lesson wasn’t in the finding, but in the passing on" crystallizes cost with conceptual weight; Accumulative lens holds through aurora’s unraveling into gold threads.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Aurora-lit ridgeway constrains every choice—from path crumbling to bridge germination—and charges the final image where "the ridgeway was not alone," proving micro-setting necessity for 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via courier’s agency when he rips the pendant, but woman’s appearance relies slightly on coincidence; cost remains unmistakable as mentor’s dissolution reshapes "passing on" as obligation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through action: seeds becoming stories, bridge vibrating with footsteps; final line "the hum was home" reweights the premise without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("aurora’s pulse," "wind carried them into the fade") modulates perfectly under pressure; rhythm shifts from fragmented tension to flowing closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless density—"pebbles skittering into the abyss" compresses setting/stakes—but "heart hammering" in bridge-germination beat risks scaffold in peak pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synthesizes courier trope with "hum" as living vibration; emotional specificity in "tremor before the bloom" transforms fade into myth-memory continuum without derivative safety.</comment>
