<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lena's shift from mistrust to trust; embodied choices like drawing the ticket reveal values under pressure. Couple's underdevelopment slightly weakens relationship crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with Lena stepping outside—cost of years of mistrust crystallized in "heart lighter than the sky." Lens ambiguity resolved early; Accumulative/Textural drive holds flawlessly through final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Crystal pavers function as micro-setting that constrains choice (acoustics enable eavesdropping) and charges closure ("crystals settling"). Projector lens warps light literally/metaphorically, directly enabling Lena's pivotal action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Lena's agency: drawing the ticket forecloses her old habit of cryptic doodles. Cost is visceral in her emotional shift ("didn't need to translate"), narrowing options toward earned transparency under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ticket motif: final image ("shape of truth, drawn in ink and trust") reweights "mistrust" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—Lena's realization feels earned through concrete action, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in light/water imagery ("lens warping lines of skin"); rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure (shorter sentences when couple arrives). Zero head-hopping; voice stays anchored in Lena's tactile observations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold—every line propels meaning. "Water trickling through crystal pavers" uses parallel structure intentionally for rhythm; no figurative muddle even in peak beats like the ticket drawing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "silent witness" trope through crystal acoustics and doodles as truth-telling. Risks quiet closure but earns it through accumulation—Lena's final step resonates as fresh inflection of "beginnings."</comment>
