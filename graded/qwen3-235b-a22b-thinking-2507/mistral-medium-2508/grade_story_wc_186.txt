<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in retrocognition's gift-turned-loneliness; micro-choices (pressing palm to fracture, tracing paths) reveal hierarchy of values. Slight abstraction in "prove coincidences have meaning" motivation prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: "prism cooling... hush now a quiet murmur" reconfigures meaning through the final image. Accumulative lens holds perfectly; rain scent and beacon's purpose shift from hope to acceptance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass pavilion and prism constrain every choice—from scuffed stairs to mended crystal charging the final image. Sensory specificity ("teeth ache" from hush, "thistle-blown moment") avoids cliché while mirroring internal stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation: retrocognition's cost (loneliness) and prism's hush narrow options toward the beacon's meaning. Agency in rekindling feels earned, though collapse timeframe's pressure could tighten further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through shards: "meaning in the fractures" crystallizes in the final reconfiguration without moralizing. The mother's tea-cup memory reframes retrocognition as seeing "pasts you’d missed," avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("salt wind worn glass," "hush predated sound") modulates under pressure. Lyric compression taught early pays off; no head-hopping despite dense reflection. Final line’s rhythm echoes the pavilion’s song.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "pavilion wasn’t just humming. It was *singing*" shows rhythmic propulsion. Minor overwriting in "silence so deep it made her teeth ache" (-0.1) but serves accumulative texture without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes through prism’s hush and retrocognition’s specificity. "Thistle-blown hope" redefines collapse as meaning-making, with risk-taking (lyric structure) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
