<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's contradictory impulses—using perceived fearlessness as a tool while embodying grief—manifest in her micro-choices (dangling the fob as a "noose," deploying false starts). Her final endurance carries visible cost in the fob's "silent weight," avoiding therapy-speak during peak tension ("his face went slack" not "he felt betrayed").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes when Lena captures "the exact pitch of a man realizing he’d been outplayed," with cost legible in "the quiet after, when the world kept turning." Accumulative lens holds: pressure builds via Lena’s tracking of Veyne’s tells until the snapping "dry bone" reconfigures stakes without causal action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The fob evolves from "warm against her palm" to "silent weight," constraining Lena’s choices (dangling it mid-confrontation) and charging the final image where she carries it "polished smooth." Sensory details ("tar and stolen rum," "anise on his breath") reflect urgency while avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Lena’s agency drives escalation: her false starts ("feather on the scale") narrow Veyne’s options until the irreversible "shuddering note of a promise snapping." Conceptual cost (irretrievable loss of trust) is unmistakable in "the world kept turning and you were the only one who noticed the missing piece," reweighting the dominant stake under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "some debts weren’t meant to be paid in coin" gains resonance via the fob’s evolution, not moralizing. Final image ("smoke curling... like a question no one needed to answer") offers non-literal resolution to "capturing trust breaking," avoiding thematic echo while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in Lena’s lexicon ("truce of hush," "moonshine runner") and stress-induced compression ("Greed was a language he spoke fluently"). Voice modulates from tense ("crouched in shadow") to resigned ("could finally rest") without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; every line charges momentum ("the pier groaned under the weight of the tide"). Figurative language ("chain catching the light like a noose") avoids muddle in peak beats. Minor deduction: "syrup-thick murmur" slightly overwrites but serves Veyne’s characterization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms revenge tropes via Lena’s psychological quarry ("sound of trust breaking"). The fob’s evolution—from tool to burden—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (climax as internal shift, not violence) heightens stakes without gimmickry, resisting safety-middle choices.</comment>
