<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied choices ("pressed the spine of a runaway dream," "breath hitched"), but "dreams become hungry" lacks prior causality. Contradictory impulses (order vs. freedom) power the climax, yet the hunger motivation feels unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise (empty beach with footprint, salt-damp pillow), with visceral cost. Orientation fails at 120 words ("whispering archipelago" remains vague), incurring -0.4 penalty; disorientation payoff arrives too late to waive penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Watercolor palette constrains choices (shattered shards refract light) and charges the final image (dew as "light made liquid"). Black sand, saltwind, and ozone create tactile specificity that actively shapes the vitalization attempt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Accumulative/Textural lens: failed photo (silver streaks) deepens into pulsing image, raising cost of the dream's dissolution. But pressure lacks meaningful tightening—adjusting aperture feels mechanical, not earned escalation under protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "luminous absence" reweights "vitalize" from preservation to temporary liberation. Final image (salt-damp pillow, dew palette) resonates without moralizing, though "meant to be lived" edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ghosts of ink," "cipher of longing") with rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulates from hushed dawn to urgent climax, and lyric compression (e.g., "palette flared—once, twice—like a match in a hurricane") is taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with minor overwriting: "match in a hurricane" clashes with watercolor motif (mixed metaphor), and "drowned atlas" feels forced. Propulsion stalls slightly in library aftermath, but final image ("light made liquid") avoids closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms librarian trope through tactile ingenuity (palette as light-net, ink-stained fingers). "Walking on water" trope gains freshness via mist-dress and fraying edges, though archipelago risks generic "magical island" associations without deeper logic.</comment>
