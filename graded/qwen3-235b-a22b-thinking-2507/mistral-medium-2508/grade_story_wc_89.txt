<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Liora both reaches for her brother’s echo and feels its "cold of deep water" simultaneously; embodied grief in "hollow so vast it had its own gravity" avoids therapy-speak. Brother’s echo lacks sufficient pressure as secondary character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "She was the bridge. And for the first time, she didn’t fight it" crystallizes stance with visible cost (crumbled fortune, burned wrist). Accumulative lens holds through spice-density escalation without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vanilla pod and nutmeg function as micro-setting that constrains choices—"crushed a pod... air shimmered" and "ground nutmeg into her palms" directly enable magic. Moonlight’s "silver gaze" subtly mirrors Liora’s porous grief without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: first failed vision (saffron breath), then costly brother-echo with "cold that pulls you under." Dominant stake (reforging bond) tightens via spice mechanics, but phoenix timeframe lacks live-clock pressure beyond atmospheric role.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "You will become what you seek" transforms from literal resurrection to self-acceptance in closure. Final image reweights metamorphosis as bridge-building without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "soil that hummed with heartbeat of things older than memory" and spice lexicon. Rhythmic control peaks during nutmeg scene ("ground... sear... pulled") with compression that heightens pressure without muddying clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("stag collapsed into stardust, and from dust rose a figure"). Minor register drift in "paradoxical steadiness" (academic diction) slightly dulls peak-beat immediacy but doesn’t obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Spice-based magic system transforms grief tropes through specific mechanics (clove stitching souls). Emotional truth in "fingers passed through his wrist" outweighs familiar orchard setting; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
