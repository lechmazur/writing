<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (carving names vs hollows) manifests in the chisel slip and poem addition; embodied grief as "scream never voiced" avoids label-speak; the final micro-choice to carve hollows earns the thematic shift with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands through the hollows reconfiguration; the butterfly trade crystallizes the stance with felt cost ("trembled as she took it"); Accumulative lens holds as sensory density (butterflies, rain, thunder) reweights grief's meaning without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The stone itself constrains choice—cracking when chisel slips forces the hollows realization; the greenhouse becomes a lantern under butterfly pressure, charging the final image where rain "striking wings like a chisel" ties setting to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through the carver’s agency: re-tracing Liora’s name triggers the crack, then hollowing the stone actively transforms grief; the cost is legible in his daughter’s trembling hands and the "wound" becoming "a door" under Accumulative escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the hollows motif—never stated outright—culminating in the non-literal answer: grief as "a vessel" shaped by absence; the final image ("door... opened together") reweights the stone’s meaning without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "bruised violet" dusk, "wings like stained glass" filtered through the carver’s trade; rhythmic control tightens during the father’s lesson ("Grief isn’t a line. It’s the space between them") without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats; "rain striking wings like a chisel" compresses metaphor with clarity; syntactic variety accelerates during the migration ("river of wings blocking light") without muddle, though "hues of bruised violet" slightly risks overwritten texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fuses spectral mentorship with mundane ritual (ribbon poems); the "hollows" synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh, transforming grief from weight to current; risk-taking (ghosts as practical teachers) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
