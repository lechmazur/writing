<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—erasing truth while haunted by it—drive every beat; the trembling paper crystallizes his earned renunciation of manufactured memories with visceral cost. No stock phrasing: guilt manifests through the watch hand’s cold weight and driftwood’s pulse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: Elias folding the note beside the "ghost" watch hand reconfigures his stance with felt cost ("weight of withheld truth tipped scales"). Accumulative lens holds—sensory density tightens until the note’s reveal, but Harkin’s off-page agency slightly blurs causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Cobalt tiles’ exposure forces Elias’s final movement; the sea actively swallows the watch hand and yields the note. Driftwood’s split-reveal directly alters tactics—no postcard backdrop but a constraint charging the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through Elias’s agency: hurling the watch hand (a renunciation) triggers the note’s discovery, narrowing options to confronting Harkin. Cost is unmistakable in the trembling paper, though the note’s arrival edges toward coincidence complicating rather than resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the "sieved hush" metaphor reweighted by the sea’s secrets: "truth lapping at his ankles" answers the central question without moralizing. The final image—waves sifting silence—resonates with earned ambiguity about truth’s weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices "grooves" in wood and "filigree edges" worn smooth by "fretting." Rhythmic control under pressure ("A wave crashed. Elias closed...") avoids head-hopping; elision of Harkin’s fate taught early and paid in the note’s reveal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; "slick with last gasp of ocean mist" compresses transit while advancing atmosphere. Minor overwriting: "too precise to be accidental, too crude to be art" slightly muddles the driftwood’s purpose in one high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms genealogy tropes through the "sieved hush" concept—truth as sediment, not silence. The cobalt terrace’s exposure and driftwood’s pulse create freshness; risk-taking (quiet ending) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
