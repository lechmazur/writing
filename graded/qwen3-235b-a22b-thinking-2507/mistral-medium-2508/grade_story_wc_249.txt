<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (subject vs. rebel) drives earned closure; embodied emotion via drumming/tapping micro-choices avoids diagnostic labels. Slight underdevelopment of specific backstory traits prevents 9.0 despite flawless closure causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("her mind was her own" against lagoon's abandoned sorrow). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation; orientation anchors within 100 words with functional disorientation paid at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Auric lagoon constrains all key choices (releasing memories via water contact) and charges final image ("heart finally quiet" against fading glow). Micro-setting functions as tool/environment with perfect sensory selectivity under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake escalation (theft → release) driven entirely by Lira's agency under Accumulative lens; cost legible in lagoon's "froth[ing] with abandoned sorrow". Minor lack of secondary stake depth prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image ("universe inhaled... she inhaled with it") offers non-literal resolution to memory ownership without moralizing. Theme emerges solely through drumming/releasing mechanics, avoiding all thematic echo traps.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (sound/water synesthesia) with rhythmic compression under stress ("She began to sing. Not with her voice..."). Zero POV drift; lyrical elision taught immediately and paid at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; high-density propulsion ("a child’s sob, raw and red" does triple duty). Figurative language consistent through climax with no register drift. Final line crystallizes motif without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory theft trope through drumming-as-release mechanic. Emotional specificity in "auroral sorrow" avoids abstraction; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
