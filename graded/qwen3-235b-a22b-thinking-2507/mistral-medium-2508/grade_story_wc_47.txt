<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lena’s contradictory impulses—seeking solitude yet inviting Javier—culminate in the moss-grafting act, embodying "watchful dreamer" through tactile pattern-tracing. No therapy-speak; her "Brave is a word for people who don’t flinch" admission reveals embodied vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost: "the wounds didn’t feel like endings. They felt like soil" reconfigures the central stake under Accumulative/Textural lens. Only minor deduction for opaque confession backstory limiting causal escalation depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Abandoned data center actively constrains choices—server racks become planting beds, icicle patterns guide Lena’s movements. Final image of "water carving new paths" charges closure by transforming setting into metaphor for healing, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stake (healing public shame through quiet growth) tightens when Javier arrives, forcing Lena to share her refuge. Cost is visible in her pendant sacrifice and admission of unflinching bravery, driven by her agency in initiating the moss ritual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "graft new meaning onto old wounds" becomes concrete through moss-planting. Final image reweights wounds as "soil... waiting to be planted" without moralizing, offering resonant non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("language only she understood" for drip patterns) and rhythmic control under pressure. Javier’s dialogue ("weirdest places") stays character-particular; no head-hopping as Lena’s POV modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "confession had been a bonfire; this was the embers" compresses transit efficiently. Minor deduction for "green and slightly bitter" scent description bordering on generic, but no loops or figurative muddle near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "public shaming" trope through specific moss-grafting ritual in decaying tech space. Risk-taking (quiet healing over confrontation) heightens stakes coherently; "wounds as soil" inflection feels inevitable yet fresh, avoiding safety-middle hedging.</comment>
