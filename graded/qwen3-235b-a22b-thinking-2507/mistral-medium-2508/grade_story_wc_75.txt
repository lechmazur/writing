<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Liora’s embodied urgency ("hands shook," "breath hitched") and micro-choices (carving initials despite mind lagging) reveal her value hierarchy under pressure. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; her drive toward preservation feels singular rather than conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: shattering the lens destroys the tool but enables communal revival ("the displaced would not be lost"). Accumulative lens holds—density peaks when dough’s *K* "swollen, then *moved*," reweighting the dominant stake through sensory escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The waterfall’s spray and lichen ("glowed faintly, like old regret") constrain choices (oven heat for lens activation) and charge the final image ("waterfall’s song... a lullaby"). Sensory details reflect urgency: crisis narrows Liora’s perception to dough textures and light flares.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Liora’s agency: the lens’ oven test transforms passive observation into active intervention. Cost is visible in the lens’ destruction and the baker’s gasp, but the beekeeper’s "absorption" revelation occurs off-page, slightly muddying escalation’s causal thread under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: initials in dough and honeycombs reconfigure "rescue" as communal thawing. The final line—"too busy baking"—avoids moralizing while resonating with the core question of preservation, charged by the "honey and salt" taste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Liora’s perceptual signature ("emerald flare revealed... hands pressing against rock") filters all details through her museum-guide lens. Rhythmic control under pressure peaks when the *K* "swollen, then *moved*," compressing tension without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("crumbling loaf," "dry as parchment") propels momentum. "Sharp green ache" risks therapy-speak but is redeemed by immediate sensory grounding ("honey and salt"). Minor register drift in "conceptual cost" near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via specific grotto logic: baking initials isn’t quirk but a survival tactic against dissolution. The lens’ shattering as renewal (not restoration) feels inevitable. Avoids safety-middle by embracing quiet urgency over catastrophe.</comment>
