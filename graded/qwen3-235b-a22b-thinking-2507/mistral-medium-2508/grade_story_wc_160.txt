<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Liora’s embodied contradiction—engineer’s precision versus inherited compassion—drives her pivotal choice. Her micro-decision to unfold the letter (not thirds but halves) reveals character under pressure, with cost legible in her steady hands at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: elders’ shadows pooling like ink crystallize the stake’s weight. Accumulative/Textural lens holds via adhesive analysis deepening meaning, not causal turns. Cost proof: "bridge or a shackle" reweights the chain’s significance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Volcano amphitheater isn’t backdrop but constraint—acoustics hide truth, dust sifts with tension. Surveyor’s chain evolves from relic to charged symbol, directly shaping Liora’s final act (unspooled on table) and closure image ("valley would breathe").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single stake (control vs. harmony) tightens via Liora’s deepening realization, not external pressure. Cost is palpable in elders’ mortar-set faces and the conceptual price of "letting water through." Accumulative escalation reweights options through blueprint’s emotional texture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sluice system’s "yield," not moralizing. Final line ("strength isn’t just holding back water") reweights prior material as non-literal answer to central question, avoiding thematic echo while charging the closure with earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Engineer’s perceptual signature dominates: adhesive layers, brass measurements, and "gears weep" diction. Rhythmic control under pressure ("pulse stuttered" to "hands not trembling") avoids ventriloquism; volcanic breath motif modulates tone organically.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding—every line charges momentum. "T’s crossed like bridges" exemplifies high-density prose; no figurative muddle even in peak beats. Final line ("valley would breathe. And so would she") crystallizes closure without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "hidden blueprint" trope via volcanic micro-setting and handwriting-as-compassion. Fresh inflection: machinist’s "concession" reframes engineering as endurance. Avoids safety middle by risking elders’ rejection without tidy resolution.</comment>
