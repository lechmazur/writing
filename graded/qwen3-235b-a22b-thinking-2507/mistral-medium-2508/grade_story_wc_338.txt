<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (Guild training vs henge intuition) act simultaneously in scene; final renunciation of proof earned by film evidence with visible conceptual cost ("no proof, only quiet certainty").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: map transforms from boundary to key with undeniable conceptual cost ("silence was a language"). Orientation flawless within 40 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vault's rain-scouring and henge stones actively constrain choices (light conditions for film projection); final image charged by "henge’s hum still thrumming in her ribs" reweighting environment as living language.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("threshold of when") tightens through protagonist's agency (film overlay method); conceptual cost of abandoning Guild dogma legible in "quiet certainty" reconfiguring final image under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action ("map’s tear stitched itself closed in her mind’s eye"); final image ("map felt like a key") offers non-literal answer to "silence as language" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct ("measured the world in quiet spaces between recorded and remembered"); rhythmic compression during discovery ("She rewound the films, her pulse steady") heightens pressure without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "frescoes shivered. The henge’s stones hummed, not with sound, but with the shape of it" achieves high density with crystal-clear propulsion in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "ancient mystery" trope through cartographer's lens; "silence between seasons" concept feels inevitable yet fresh, with risk-taking (silent films as time markers) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
