<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("Liberating memories isn’t kindness," yet she pushes) and embodied cost (darkened box, immediate flight) crystallize earned renunciation. Micro-choices like tracing glass fractures reveal values under pressure without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: "stained glass box now dark and quiet" and her refusal to stay reconfigure stakes. Accumulative lens holds—breadcrumbs to unraveling threads—without orientation debt or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bone Fountain’s calcified wishes directly constrain choice (door fused in stone), while the stained glass box’s micro-setting charges the final image (fountains weeping light). Sensory details like "rust instead of water" reflect urgency without checklist clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberating memories) tightens through Liora’s agency: hesitation at "They’re not yours to take" forecloses safety, paid with the box’s death and her flight. Escalation via Accumulative lens—thread-snapping to city’s awakening—reweights cost unmistakably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "sidereal patience" redefined as action timing, not waiting. Final image ("fountains began to weep. Not water. Light.") offers non-literal answer to "unsticking sealed" things without moralizing, charging prior material through cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "glass shards embedded in mortar" and "scent of lavender where none grew." Rhythmic control under pressure ("She exhaled, slow and deliberate") avoids head-hopping; elision (breadcrumbs) taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("vibration like a plucked string" conveys texture, emotion, plot). Final line ("the city breathed. And so did she") resolves with recharged motif. No figurative muddle in peak beats like memory-pulling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "memory liberation" trope via sticky honey threads and calcified wishes. Fresh inflection in "sidereal patience" redefinition feels inevitable—geese/fountains logic inseparable from emotional truth. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
