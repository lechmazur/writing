<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses ("harmless archivist" vs rebel) drive Lena's arson choice with visible cost: her erasure ("name just another whisper"). Rook's "You're late" crystallizes relationship pressure under time constraints without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "left it in the door" crystallizes rebellion continuity while Lena's erasure ("whisper in the static") makes cost undeniable. Accumulative lens holds through mosaic shards taught by "The water rippled. The line held." at 25%.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Auric lagoon constrains every choice: reflections guide navigation, water transmits Rook's voice, dawn rewrites its appearance. Final "water rippled" charges closure with earned hope—environment meets 9+ gate by shaping tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Lena's agency: puddle navigation → key turn → arson, narrowing options to "rewrite the revisions." Cost is legible in "her name just another whisper" as conceptual erasure forecloses legacy, reweighting stakes under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Final key placement answers "How resist indifference?" non-literally: rebellion lives in "cracks," not streets. Avoids moralizing; historians' debate shows earned complexity. "Tyranny of indifference" remains diegetic (Rook's line), never thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Archivist's perceptual signature ("map of fractured reflections") modulates under pressure: syntax tightens to fragments during climax ("She answered."). Mosaic structure taught early; no head-hopping despite time jumps. Dialogue subtext ("You're late") pursues urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "static between what was said and what was true" multi-tasks setting/theme. Final line uses repetition purposefully without muddle. Reads aloud with cadence shifts matching tension—e.g., staccato sentences during arson planning.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms rebellion tropes via archivist protagonist and puddle navigation. "Key in door" ending avoids cliché by prioritizing continuity over victory. Risk-taking (mosaic structure) heightens stakes coherently: early "water rippled" pays off in closure.</comment>
