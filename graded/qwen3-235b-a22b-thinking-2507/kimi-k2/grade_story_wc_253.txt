<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through the performer’s blankness (e.g., emptiness carrying "faint echo" of sorrow), but the farmer’s moral ambiguity remains label-only without tradeoffs; micro-choices like the stem-rolling reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the hollow heart with petal crystallizes options with felt cost (silent tears, clenched fist); Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density; one tightening (farmer’s confession) narrows options sufficiently for length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cedar shavings function as micro-setting, constraining choices (piling between them as unspoken words) and charging the final image (scattered like pale birds); turbines’ "remade hush" evolves from engineered silence to lullaby, mirroring emotional shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the performer’s agency (whittling/narrating), forcing the farmer’s confession and hollow heart acceptance; cost is unmistakable in the "weight of nothing become something," but the mandate’s pressure lacks tangible escalation beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the hollow heart’s final image—grief as cultivatable lightness—without moralizing; the petal in cedar reweights "remade hush" into conceptual cost (sorrow smuggled in shavings), avoiding thematic echo despite performer’s philosophical lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in the performer’s voice ("blade rounds the edge, teaching the wood to forgive") and farmer’s flat dialogue; compression of grief into physical objects (shavings, heart) teaches the lyric pattern early, paid off in the final lullaby shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Overwriting in "dramatically narrating" repetitions risks density (e.g., "crumbles into dust of a joke no one dared finish"), but cadence shifts during the hollowing beat ("last curl falls... space where both can breathe") propel closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mandated joy dystopia via tactile grief rituals (whittling, petal placement); the wind turbines’ "remade hush" transforms from oppressive sound to lullaby, avoiding derivative eco-dystopia through specific emotional stakes.</comment>
