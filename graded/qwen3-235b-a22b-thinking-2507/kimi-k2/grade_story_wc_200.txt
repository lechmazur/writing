<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Limited contradictory impulses; "modestly fearless" shown through descent but interiority lacks specific emotional contradiction beyond core task. Micro-choices like offering palm reveal hierarchy of values, yet collector's centuries-long burden feels abstractly stated rather than embodied in key decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with undeniable cost (knot dissolving, vials emptied), but escalation under Accumulative/Textural lens lacks meaningful deepening—the descent progresses linearly without transformative pressure shifts. The gorge's narrowing to "blade of rose and gold" reweights stakes but doesn't alter tactics beyond the musician's arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Echo Gorge functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (narrow trail forcing descent, wind aperture creating pure note) and charges the final image ("luminous ache" blazed by mica shards). Basalt cliffs as harp frame and crocodile's tooth as tuning tool integrate physicality with thematic resolution, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (integrating laughter) tightens when tooth vibrates toward musician's cave, narrowing options. But cost remains abstract—"knot dissolving" lacks visceral, dramatized consequence; the "centuries" burden isn't concretely shown through lost opportunities or altered capabilities during the descent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through harp metaphor reweighted by final image: "music blamed for silence" crystallizes into integrated laughter without moralizing. The musician's death laugh and boatman's confession create organic complexity; the gorge's "luminous ache" answers the central question of healing through absurd joy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("confessions drifted upward in ribbons of pale fire") and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; voice modulates from hushed descent to bright laughter. Slight register drift in "modestly fearless" (abstract label) risks thematic echo but is redeemed by embodied action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops but near-overwriting in "murmuring voices that rose from the chasm like steam" (steam doesn't murmur). High density falters in "cold seeped through like melted silver"—redundant "seeped"/"melted"—yet propulsion remains intact through closure. Final line ("sun stood fully above the world") avoids cliché with earned cadence shift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of soul collector trope via harp physics: laughter as tuning mechanism transforms familiar material. Crocodile tooth (absurdity anchor) and plague musician avoid archetypes through specific, verifiable details ("severed foot sliding like comedic fish"). Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
