<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: "sunwashed dread only sharpened her resolve" embodies conflicting impulses. Final choice to play the chord is earned through prior pattern work, with visceral cost (bleeding lips) scaling to length. No therapy-speak; emotions rooted in concrete action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost: gate opening flakes like "red snow" while turtles sigh back to sleep. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—the density increase of sound patterns converging ("cracks raced... knitting and splitting") reweights stakes with Neris's blood sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The turtle-shell micro-setting directly constrains choices: cracks guide navigation, growth rings crack underfoot, and the shell's fate ("turtles will wake and dive") charges the final image. Nacre staircase and reed whistle (tool) alter tactics repeatedly, avoiding generic postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Neris's agency alone: her sound-mapping leads to crack discovery, glyph melody, and the resonant chord. Cost is unmistakable—blood on the reed and stirred turtles—though the escalation from "charting micro-eddies" to world-altering resonance slightly outpaces mid-beat causality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of communication beyond language emerges purely through action: the glyph melody becomes a mirrored chord resolving silence. Final image ("gate closed behind them") offers resonant, non-literal answer to "questioning the watchers" without moralizing, reweighting the premise through cost (lost dream inheritance).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Neris notices "micro-eddies of wind" and "hairline cracks," with rhythm tightening under pressure ("She played. The cracks raced."). Purposeful compression ("On the fourteenth day...") taught early pays off in closure's fragmented cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("exhaling warm salt air that smelled of open ocean" does triple duty). Minor overwriting in "fractal urgency" (-0.1) but no closure impact. Final line’s abrupt cutoff ("with a") is intentional fragment taught by earlier compression, enhancing propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: turtle-shell city + sound cartography transforms apocalypse tropes. Emotional specificity in "quiet drive" turning to urgency avoids generic doom. The watchers' dissolution into "motes" reconfigures silence as active participation, feeling inevitable through prior pattern work.</comment>
