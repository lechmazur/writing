<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-choices (kneeling, showing photograph) reveal Mara's hierarchy of values with embodied cost; 'damp velvet' hush crystallizes the fear/curiosity tension that drives her incidental heroism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: 'tracer warm against her skin' makes the emotional burden undeniable while 'fragile, persistent pulses' reconfigures the dead's vulnerability under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The hearing aid (micro-setting) constrains choice—dial adjustment transforms 'pulses' into syllables—and charges the final image where its 'red light winked once, then went dark' embodies completed work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen organically as multiple nameless dead appear, but the cost of Mara's emotional labor ('voice the bridge') could resonate more viscerally in the final image beyond atmospheric weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: 'Tell them I tried' and 'he still whistles the tune' reject moralizing, while the final 'fragile, persistent pulses' reweight 'vulnerable voices' as an enduring, unromanticized burden.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ('tracer humming like a second pulse') persists under pressure; rhythmic control in high-stakes beats ('Help us' to 'I will assure') avoids dialogue clichés with purposeful indirection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor synonym loops ('pulse came through... tracer pulsed again') and stacked adjectives ('fragile, persistent') in non-closure beats slightly dilute momentum, but zero scaffold in pivotal voice-repeating sequences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms 'ghost story' trope through tactile specificity (rewired hearing aid, creased photograph) and moral complexity—'incidental heroism' as burden, not triumph—without safety-hedging flaws.</comment>
