<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via Lark resisting molting ("personality began to itch...clinging to Lark") and embodied emotion ("tremor in Lark's hands"). Final vow earned by "Anchor" inscription, though Mira's "Beauty is quietest riot" borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Valid Charged Poise closure: paper birds sprouting from roof crystallize resistance with cost (Lark's cracking voice, leaving Mira). Accumulative lens holds; moon descent and molting pressure tighten options. Cost proven by "voice cracking like light through stained glass" during vow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rusted library isn't backdrop—it enables action (bullet-holed skylight for paper birds, mildew/gunpowder scents). Coffee tin's false bottom constrains choices (hiding map, seedpods). Final image charged by birds "sprouting" from broken roof, reweighting concrete as resistance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Mira reveals "warden will torch annex," forcing Lark's agency in "tonight we bloom." Pressure grows via moon's descent (triggering molting) and time-sensitive book rescue. Cost legible in Lark's physical fracture ("voice cracking") and forsaking identity stability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (folding books into "origami grenades that carry only ink"), not abstraction. Final image reweights "blooming resistance" as paper birds escaping prison walls. Mira's bus-ticket phrase risks echo but is saved by tactile delivery ("pockets empty except for a single bus ticket").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "scent of mildewed paper and distant gunpowder" filters setting through poetic urgency. Rhythm modulates under pressure (short clauses during molting: "skin of self loosening, memories sliding like silk"). No head-hopping; lyric compression taught early via ticket-poems.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "voice soft as moth wings" exemplifies textural specificity. Metaphors serve pressure ("cracking like light through stained glass" during vow). Final image—"paper birds...drifting over prison walls"—achieves crystalline clarity with no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms resistance trope through concrete mechanics: bus-ticket verses, coffee-tin seedpods, taxonomy of "revolt, tenderness, incandescence." Emotional truth in identity instability ("Anchor" as charm against vanishing). Fresh inflection: "origami grenades that carry only ink" redefines weaponry.</comment>
