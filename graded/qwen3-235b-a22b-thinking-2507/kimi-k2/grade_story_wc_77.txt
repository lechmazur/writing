<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in unbosoming fears while clutching the cursed photo; embodied dread ("teeth falling upward") avoids labels. Final choice to lunge for the black mirror earns endurance through prior causality. Minor competence overreach in instantly grasping recursion weakens struggle slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost: advisor trapped mid-whisper in the clasp reconfigures fear's weakness. Accumulative lens holds via paradox density tightening options. The black mirror's "exit wound" payoff proves cost legible on-page with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Opera cloak clasp functions as micro-setting constraining every pivotal choice—from warning to swallowing the dictionary to trapping the advisor. Final image of sagging funhouse boards folding "like a mouth" charges closure through prior tactile specificity. Zero generic placeholder details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: unbosoming fears directly triggers the reflections' advance under accumulative pressure. Cost crystallizes visibly when the Polaroid shows the trapped advisor—conceptual price paid for refusing the frame. Dominant stake (escaping recursive fear) tightens via one decisive deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the rewritten dream dictionary's final line; "witness who refuses the frame" reweights the entire premise without moralizing. Final image of funhouse exhaling onto broken bulbs offers resonant answer to fear's recursion. Zero thematic echo or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in stress: "cotton-candy rot" breath, "bruise colors" from flickering bulbs. Rhythmic compression during climax ("I lunged... wolf head snapped shut") modulates perfectly with pressure. Advisor's whispers carry subtext without diagnostic dialogue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; every line advances atmosphere or stakes ("mirrors rippled, and from each stepped a version of me"). Figurative language ("repulsive allure shimmering like heat above asphalt") remains coherent under pressure. Final truncated bulb pulse heightens lyric closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms funhouse trope through specific logic: fear's weakness as recursion, not courage. Emotional truth in "applause turns to laughter" grounds the conceptual gamble. Closure's "sliver of luminance" synthesizes risk and inevitability without gimmickry.</comment>
