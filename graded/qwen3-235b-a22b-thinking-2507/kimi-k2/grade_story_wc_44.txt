<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "rehearsed reunion in dreams, but dreams had no weight" and embodied emotion in throat tightening; micro-choices like finding hidden door via reflection show values hierarchy with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: merging with mother's shadow forecloses solitary searching with visceral cost (automaton stopping, mirrors cracking); causal lens holds through "close the loops" mechanics driving every escalation beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring objects charge closure: Möbius spoon physically enables shadow-spilling and final merger; observatory's reflective surfaces constrain choices (door found via sphere reflection) and reweight stakes in cracking mirrors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency under causal lens: inserting spoon narrows options to irreversible choice; cost legible in automaton's stopped ticking and "whispers braided into voice," though secondary stake depth lacks minor refinement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "to relearn is to forgive the forgetting" crystallizes in spoon insertion's physical cost, avoiding moralizing; final shadow merger offers resonant non-literal answer to "where shadows go" without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "rune chalk ground from meteorite bone" and "spilled mercury" starlight; rhythmic control intensifies under pressure ("gears whispered... candle ignited") with consistent lyrical compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "shadow spilled out, pooling at her feet like liquid night" advancing plot/character/atmosphere simultaneously; no figurative muddle even in peak beats like spoon-flame contact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "sealed awakening" as repeated choice transforms trope; emotional specificity in "mother’s shadow walked away without her" avoids generic grief; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
