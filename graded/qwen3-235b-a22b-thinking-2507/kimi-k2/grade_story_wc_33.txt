<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Six’s rebellious respect; embodied emotions like the bottle’s “shudder, remembering its own stolen constellations” avoid labels. Micro-choices (sparking names, pocketing token) reveal values with visible cost. Only slight overuse of “respectfully rebellious” label risks summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: checkpoint lights shifting from threats to lanterns reconfigures hope with felt cost in synchronized heartbeats. Orientation clear by word 40; accumulative lens holds through sensory accumulation. Minor deduction for repetitive “respectfully rebellious” weakening causality in peak beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cobalt arcade constrains choices via maintenance hatch tunnel and machine interactions; micro-setting (bottle’s warmth) directly charges closure’s heartbeat sync. Sensory details like ozone and popcorn smell evolve with plot. Environment fully qualifies the 9+ gate by shaping tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mending promises) signaled early, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—Six reacts to storm/drone rather than driving change. Cost is legible (synchronized heartbeats), yet pressure doesn’t meaningfully tighten under accumulative lens. Missing one pivotal tightening choice that narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through copper token toll and “rerouted” promises; final image reweights war’s tear as “stitch” without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality via concrete actions (sparking names). Repetition of “respectfully rebellious” slightly edges toward thematic echo, narrowly avoiding Q5 penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (“neon tubes flickering like dying fireflies”) and rhythmic control shine, but rigid refrain of “respectfully rebellious” disrupts voice consistency across 4 instances. Elision taught early (drone’s return) pays off cleanly. Near-9.0 except for label repetition marring pressure moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose dazzles with textural specificity (“thunderstorm in a bottle tucked beneath his coat”), but “respectfully rebellious” appears 4 times as template cadence, triggering -0.4 artifact deduction. Zero loops in closure beat, yet repetition in mid-scene dulls momentum. Would score 9.0+ without this flaw.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms war tropes via bottled storm and drone courier; specific mechanics (copper token toll, sparking names) ground universals. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes coherently. Emotional specificity (“He said he’d bring me stars”) avoids generic templates, making the ordinary feel inevitable.</comment>
