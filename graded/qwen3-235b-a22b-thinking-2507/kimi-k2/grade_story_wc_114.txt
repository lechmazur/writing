<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via embodied choices (Elias' graphite-smudged glacier revision) and contradictory impulses (oracle's margin-hugging method vs. final confession), but oracle's passivity slightly dilutes agency; micro-choices earn the hand-hold closure with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias' logbook entry ("uncertainty 100%, hope measurable...") crystallizes the cost of truth with conceptual weight (4.7g silence), perfectly fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens through density escalation and irrevocable reconfiguration of the glacier's meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Weather station functions as micro-setting crucible: the scale literally measures silence, thermometers drive oracle's method, and the logbook's smudged margins directly constrain choices, charging the final image where peaks become "honest, smudged gray" through environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate texturally through accumulated error (margin notes, bleeding carbon copies) culminating in Elias' smudge—a protagonist-driven act that redefines the glacier's representation and pays visible cost (shifted logbook entry), fulfilling Accumulative lens with undeniable conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the gentian's evolution from "ghosted" illustration to heart-carried memory, avoiding moralizing; the final whisper ("the glacier is gone, but the gentian remembers") offers resonant non-literal answer to truth's weight without stating a moral, charging prior material through wet earth's scent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("peripherally aware," "frost feathers") and rhythmic control shine under pressure; the oracle's voice modulates from hesitant ("damp prints like signatures") to decisive ("truth has mass only when confessed"), with all elision (e.g., fever breaks) taught and paid off in logbook closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels multiple elements (e.g., "steam rising like doubts too light to confess" advances atmosphere, character, and theme), with figurative language precise and closure-crisp ("scent of wet earth" avoids sentimentality through earned context).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms climate grief tropes via specific mechanics: truth as measurable weight (4.7g), glacier as "rumor the mountain repeats," and "fault-tolerant" reframing prophecy as error-acceptance; risk-taking (lyric accumulation over plot) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
