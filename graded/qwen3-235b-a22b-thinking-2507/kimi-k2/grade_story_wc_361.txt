<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (anonymity vs mythic fade) drive final choice; embodied anxiety ("knees clicked") avoids label-speak. Slight occupational detail thinness prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost (Rell's transformation); Accumulative lens holds through patterned encounters. Orientation flawless in opening sentence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Aurora-lit ridgeway actively pressures choices (cliff face deadline); pendant as micro-setting charges final image ("wings flashing mirrored signals"). Environment constrains tactics relentlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deliver pendant vs preserve mentor's legacy) tightens through encounters; cost of Rell's mythic fade crystallizes options. Agency-driven deepening under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Final image ("winged note carried on wind") offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing; theme emerges purely through particulars like dragonfly-shaped breath fog.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("aurora felt like questions"); rhythmic control shifts with tension ("night pulled tighter"). Zero head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; "knees clicked with nerves" exemplifies textural specificity. Slight cliché risk in "dense as amber" redeemed by context; no figurative muddle in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of courier trope through physics of wonder-as-vibration; emotional truth in how ordinary encounters become mythic. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
