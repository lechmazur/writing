<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("bravely conflicted") manifests physically through micro-choices: violet fingers brushing dossier, overriding terminal "defiantly careful." Final renunciation of silence earns through prior causality—archivist’s duty transformed into truth-spreading. Slight abstraction in "love for vanished wordsmith" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is Charged Poise: "He said speak so I spoke" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (red text on skylights). Accumulative lens holds—pressure builds through frost density ("brittle icing," "whispering stalactite") to irreversible scandal. Orientation flawless ("snowfalls sealed echoing library" by word 15). Minor lens ambiguity early caps at 8.9.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cryo-vault’s -31°C constrains every choice ("one mis-step splinters lungs"), charging the climax. Recurring "dizzying quiet" evolves from oppressive ("dripped off vaulted rafters") to resonant ("lullaby sharpened to a knife"), directly shaping the final image. Micro-setting mastery: heat stylus and DNA-locked paper drive tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. survival) tightens through Tatiana’s agency: plugging networks "by proxy" forces irreversible scandal. Cost is legible in "red trails across plaza" and "alarm klaxons stunned." Escalation falters slightly—chemical trigger’s mechanics lack setup, making deepening feel convenient rather than earned under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "thawing seeds" metaphor reweighted at closure: contraband truths "burrowing" into public ports, then "pink snow" at dawn. Final image ("hunger for cinnamon") answers "unspoken conversation" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—confession scrolls as holo-pages, not sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: cold distills all detail ("frost sparkling at lips," "ice glazed seal"). Rhythmic control under pressure shifts from lyrical ("moonlight frosting silence") to staccato during crisis ("heartbeat versus regime"). Zero head-hopping; elision ("two autumns earlier") taught early and paid in scandal’s spread.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose dazzles with textural density ("glacial hushes," "crimson shimmer"), but "heartbeat versus regime" slightly drifts into abstraction. One paraphrase loop: "dizzying quiet" recurs without evolution. Crucially, artifacts avoid closure beat—final line’s "frost sparkling" retains clarity. High-band cap at 8.7 per global gate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms dystopian tropes through cryo-archivist lens: truth "half-living in suspended ink" gains freshness via library’s literal frozen stacks. Bold risk in Accumulative structure pays off—scandal spreads through "custodial spiders," not confrontation. Derivative premise guardrail avoided by specific tools (heat stylus, DNA-locked paper).</comment>
