<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority excels with embodied burdens ("pressing against collarbones like wet wool"), but "boundary-lessly trapped" lacks causal friction; calcification as earned endurance compensates with visible cost during sphere transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise via Accumulative lens: the final hum releases burdens while grotto's "slow time" seals cost; "shingled hush" deepening reweights stakes when sphere softens into frost pattern under lamp heat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bronze grotto functions as indispensable micro-setting—calcification into coral/stone directly charges the final image where walls "sigh, warm with weight"; frost feathers constrain choices during burden-measuring breaths.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via burden-size progression (small/medium/largest) tightens options under Accumulative lens; cost is unmistakable in calcified ribs and "spent wick spelling her name," though avalanche failure lacks earlier setup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through stone/metal weight transfer without moralizing; final image ("weights meant to be carried by stone... not flesh") reweights prior burdens via CR, avoiding sentimentality with "village ruins" and "disappearing script."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("drip... like slow confession," "flame bent like a listening ear") modulates rhythm under pressure; minor deduction for "boundary-lessly" abstraction diluting focalization during orientation beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density, but "fractal weaver" repetition risks scaffold; figurative language remains coherent ("hiss like distant surf"), though "whalebone reverie" slightly strains physical logic in peak transformation beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of weaving/weight metaphors feels inevitable—frost feathers, calcification, and "shingled hush" transform abstract burdens into tactile stakes; risk-taking heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
