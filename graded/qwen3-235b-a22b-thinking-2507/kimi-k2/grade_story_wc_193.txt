<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara's motivation (atoning for pyramid scheme sins through spore farming) drives every choice, with contradictory impulses—survivor guilt versus residual salesmanship—embodied in "ankle-deep in mycelial runoff" and bones learning the "recipe for diamond." Final renunciation of the sales pitch feels earned through prior causality, though physicality during compression lacks specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the diamond inscribed "pressure shared is pressure transformed" crystallizes regret into clarity with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds throughout, with pressure intensifying via sensory deepening (spore honey → corridor tightening) and the ultraviolet glow signaling the "thin hour" early. Cost proof is concrete in the diamond's warmth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mushroom farm actively constrains choices: spores spell coordinates in Morse, honey-sticky floor enables diamond formation, and the farm itself becomes the "chamber" for pressure. Final image of the diamond inscribed with Morse recharges the setting's purpose, meeting the 9+ gate by charging closure through micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is pure Accumulative: glitchy texts → Morse coordinates → corridor tightening → spore lattices, all driven by Mara's agency (pressing the bolt, breathing out the pitch). Pressure deepens through sensory density ("carbon whispering to carbon"), and cost is visceral in "corridor compress with tenderness of a forge," though the quantum promise's mechanics could tighten stakes further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through spores→diamond transformation, not statement—the final inscription avoids moralizing while reweighting the farm's purpose. Complexity shines in showing pyramid schemes as "compression algorithms" without redemption, and the diamond's warmth embodies earned wisdom through concrete particulars, resisting tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("air tasted of iodine and regret," "rumor could root") and rhythmic control during compression ("Spores swarmed. Carbon whispering.") heighten pressure. Glitchy text syntax mirrors quantum instability, and single-POV consistency avoids head-hopping while teaching the pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence multiplies meaning (e.g., "compost now for the glowing crop" ties history to present). "Virtuously mischievous" avoids therapy-speak through action, and final line's "warm as a held hand" delivers textural specificity without muddle. One near-miss: "conceptual or social cost" is abstract but saved by immediate diamond imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: pyramid schemes as quantum compression, bread futures at 9,000 atmospheres. Emotional truth in investor tears → diamond clarity avoids derivative "mushroom wisdom" tropes. Risk-taking (glitchy texts as dimensional communication) heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes through specific lived detail.</comment>
