<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strength: Motivation crystallizes through concrete action (pressing map to wall). Weakness: "Shielded openness" reads as abstract label rather than embodied contradiction; final choice lacks visible internal friction despite high stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands perfectly: "every blank on parchment was a wound" reweights the premise with undeniable cost. Accumulative lens holds throughout with shadow's growth narrowing options, and the rain-scoured chapel anchors orientation by paragraph 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The chapel's physical decay directly charges closure: rain-scouring enables film comparison, frescoes' fading mirrors the henge's erasure, and the wall's "exhale" that draws in the map makes environment indispensable to the final image's charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single tightening via shadow's growth creates perfect Accumulative escalation. Cost is unmistakable in the "sudden chill" and shimmering stones, though the dominant stake (erasure vs. natural loss) could sharpen earlier; agency remains purely Elara's film alignment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: map adhering to wall embodies "absence speaks louder," while the final line reweights "wounds" as "windows" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite high concept density.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("faint lines appeared, ink seeping upward") shines, but "shielded openness" slips into abstract diagnosis. Rhythmic control falters slightly in film-comparison sequence with adjacent paraphrase loops ("she set up... she drew").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "parchment adhered, as though the stone exhaled" demonstrates high density. Minor deduction for "she felt the raised grain where fibers had parted" (filter-verb stack) in a pressure beat, though not clustered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "lost henge" trope through map-framer lens and "reverse fresco" concept. Specificity of film reels (1973/2023) and the ridge's "shimmer" creates fresh inflection that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
