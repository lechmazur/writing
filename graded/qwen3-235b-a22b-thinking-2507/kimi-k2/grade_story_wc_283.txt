<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "quietly inspired" trait is stated but not tested under pressure. Final choice lacks visible cost beyond abstract wisdom transfer, weakening Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost—"cliffs shifted smoother" shows released burden—but cost isn't legible in a single image per Q2 test. Accumulative lens holds tightly through button cataloging.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Amber warehouse constrains every choice: petrified shelves supply buttons, cooling walls mark time, and "warm wax" final image charges closure. Micro-setting (buttons) directly shapes the spindle transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes ("spin prophecy before dawn") deepen through button placements, but "truth unravels" timeframe lacks visceral urgency. Agency feels passive; cost remains conceptual rather than felt in high-pressure beats like uncorking the jar.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: buttons as "fragments small enough to slip through time’s neck" and the spindle’s dissolution into "future stories" avoid moralizing while answering "What will you weave from what remains?"</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("amber-stained fingers," echo "shiver like a struck bell") with rhythmic control, though "wisdom is never owned" briefly drifts into authorial voice during high-pressure cataloging.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion but "quietly inspired" repeats verbatim (lines 12, 43), creating a paraphrase loop. Final paragraph’s cadence ("She walked... She scattered...") slightly flattens momentum without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms prophecy trope via tactile button cataloging; "sand runs upward" risks gimmickry but earns coherence through warehouse’s amber logic. Emotional specificity ("grandmother polishing jet mourning button") avoids abstraction.</comment>
