<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lin's interior contradiction (craving change vs. fear of lost control) drives the burn-and-broadcast pivot with embodied cost ("tears that tasted of brine"). Mara avoids stereotype through regretful agency, though Lin's shift from burning film to proposing broadcast lacks sufficient friction in the crucial micro-choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands perfectly: the broadcast transforms "open secret" from spy tool to shared music with visible cost (Mara's tears, reconfigured mainland lights). Lens holds as Hybrid (Accumulative pressure → Causal resolution), though coast guard resolution feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lighthouse functions as micro-setting that charges closure: Fresnel lens deciphers microdots, rotation pulses Morse code, and final image reweights it as "conductor's baton." Every detail (kerosene lantern, iron stairs) constrains action without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (control over truth) escalate through Lin's agency: burning film rejects manipulation, proposing broadcast actively reclaims power. Cost is visceral (Mara's tears, altered mainland), though Mara's sudden shift from gun to laughter lacks sufficient earned friction under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: broadcasting transforms "open secret" from weapon to communal music. Final image ("phrase became simply music") reweights the premise without moralizing, making the conceptual cost undeniable through rearranged city lights.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lin's perceptual signature shines ("sea wind sharpened prophecy"), but Mara's exposition ("courier for an agency trafficking in open secrets") briefly flattens tension. Voice modulates beautifully under stress, though the "twin moons" simile risks cliché.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with zero scaffold—every line advances plot or theme ("specs curl like black snowflakes"). Minor register drift in "transpose life into a new key" slightly over-explains the metaphor, preventing 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spy thriller and lyrical fable: fortunes as dead-drops feels inevitable through Lin's blues metaphor. Risk-taking (broadcasting secrets) heightens stakes coherently, with emotional truth in Mara's brine-tasted tears.</comment>
