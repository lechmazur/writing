<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—calm intuition versus urgent action—manifest physically in "breathed slowly, letting calm intuition spread like warm oil" while hands remain steady under pressure. Final choice to reflect her calm acceptance earns closure through prior micro-choices (tilting mirrors to stitch truth from shards).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: the dulled fragment (no longer cutting) and merged image of lantern-lit meeting crystallize treaty reconstitution. Accumulative lens holds—mirrors’ density increase reweights stake as frost retreats and floes slow, proving cost via "edges had dulled" and "treaty settle into place like a seed."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Lighthouse orchard’s glazed fruit trees constrain choice by rattling "in approval" at resolution; the fragment’s physical transformation (dulled edges → clear) charges the final image. Micro-setting mastery: mirrors aren’t described but *used* as loom, with frost retreating as empathy flows.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Mara’s agency: tilting mirrors to reflect guilt into elders’ council forces stance crystallization. Cost is visceral—fragment’s dulled edges and "treaty settle into place like a seed"—reweighting the dominant stake (treaty survival) through accumulated emotional pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reconfiguration: "light pooling on the ice like melted stars" answers the central question without moralizing. Final image reweights empathy as action via hollowed-fruit lanterns, avoiding abstraction while embracing complexity (merfolk singing in "harmonics that cracked ice into musical chimes").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "grief smooth, anger jagged, hope thin as blown glass"—Mara’s tactile emotion sorting defines voice. Rhythmic control under pressure: fragmented syntax ("Mirror after mirror offered glimpses...") mirrors splintered empathy, paid off when voices overlap as "felt" not spoken.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; every line propels: "frost retreated from their edges" shows emotional shift without telling. Figurative language serves pressure—"light pooling on the ice like melted stars" recharges the fragment’s journey. Final line’s "shifting ice floes that no longer threatened" avoids closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality in synthesizing "courageous anomaly" with treaty-making: empathy mapped via mirrors transforms merfolk/settler conflict beyond trope. Risk-taking heightens stakes—the fragment’s refusal to show futures becomes the tool for reconstitution, avoiding generic "bridge" symbolism through hollowed-fruit lanterns.</comment>
