<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira's involuntary truth-telling manifests as embodied constraint (blurted fear when glass eye touches ribs), not diagnostic label. Contradictory impulses—skepticism vs. hope—drive her planting choice with visible cost in "fragile grace we have managed not to break." Kestrel’s archetype is elevated by concrete details (patched socket, discredited textbooks).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with cost: Lira’s truth compulsion transforms into "voluntary lullabies" but the orchard’s survival remains precarious ("fragile grace"). Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density escalates via rain intensifying from "soft as apology" to "hard as interrogation," reweighting psychological safety as tangible stakes. Late orchard fear-sensing rule slightly undermines causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ravine actively pressures choices: storm-teared roots force Lira’s soil probing, while the glass eye (micro-setting) constrains action by triggering confession and later anchoring the cliff. Final image of the eye glowing "beneath the loam" charges closure by reweighting "buried secrets" from opening. Tactile specificity ("calibrated fingers," "warm pulse of the colony") avoids symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (orchard collapse) tightens through rain’s intensification and Lira’s planted eye, narrowing options to psychological safety as survival tactic. Cost is legible in "fragile grace"—endurance requires perpetual vigilance. Agency is Lira’s choice to plant despite skepticism, but orchard’s fear-sensing mechanism introduced late slightly softens escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "psychological safety" cultivated via truffle foraging and truth-telling, not abstraction. Final image of truth as "voluntary lullabies" resonates without moralizing, reweighting the opening’s "shattered mirror" through the eye’s buried glow. Avoids final-paragraph sermonizing; complexity lingers in "flawed guardians" of fragile grace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Lira’s voice has distinct perceptual signature ("soil smelled of buried secrets," "black diamonds of the earth"). Under stress, syntax compresses ("Rain began, soft as apology, then hard as interrogation") while maintaining POV consistency. Kestrel’s dialogue ("Plant it where truffles cluster thickest") reflects character-specific lexicon without convergence. No head-hopping; elision taught early via "plague years" backstory.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with minimal scaffolding—"leaves lifted, catching rain like chalices" merges action/image/theme. Slight overwriting in "fractured sound between disbelief and wonder" risks melodrama but is redeemed by contextual tension. Zero loops; sentence rhythm varies naturally to mirror storm escalation, though "pendulous almond bough" slightly echoes earlier "nooses" imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specific, grounded details: truth-telling as viral side-effect (not magic), psychological safety applied to sentient orchards. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates ("involuntarily truthful" shown via market impossibility). The glass eye’s mundane cracks ("like frost on a window") heighten stakes without gimmickry, making the final "fragile grace" feel earned and fresh.</comment>
