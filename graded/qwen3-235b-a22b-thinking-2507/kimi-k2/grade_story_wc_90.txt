<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lin's pacifism manifests through embodied micro-choices (stitching photographs, dissolving her tear) rather than declaration; contradictions between inherited grief and active mercy create authentic tension during the corridor passage where shadows reveal wounds.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when gravity returns "gentle and kind" while lanterns settle into the ship's walls—cost is the transmuted sorrow anchoring her to reclaimed reality under Accumulative lens; sigil ignition and tear dissolution provide causal anchors without undermining textural buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Emergency blanket's silver thread constrains Lin's action (stitching photographs) and charges the final image as "lanterns of shadow"; hydroponic basil and flaking deck plates create lived-in specificity that directly enables the dimensional breakthrough.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation through Accumulative lens succeeds as each stitched photograph intensifies grief-density until the tapestry lifts; cost is visceral in "tear dissolved into Kwan Yin’s Tear, doubling its glow"—but shadow work concept remains slightly abstract despite corridor revelations.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image of bioluminescent moss growing on weapon bones offers non-literal answer to pacifism's cost—reclaiming violence through mercy—without moralizing; the tear's dissolution avoids thematic echo by showing transmutation rather than stating doctrine.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("deck plates flaking like ash," "compass of regret") persists under pressure; AI dialogue risks thematic echo but "voice trembling like starlight on water" maintains voice consistency through embodied metaphor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density without scaffold—"crystallized sorrow" and "sail of ghosts" integrate cleanly—but "compass of regret" slightly muddles the needle's physical/emotional function in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Synthesis of recycled spaceship, pacifism, and shadow work feels inevitable; the tear's transformation from relic to dissolved offering avoids trope through specific mechanics (stitching photographs with emergency thread), though dimension-lock premise edges near familiarity.</comment>
