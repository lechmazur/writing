<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's "logically emotional" contradiction manifests concretely when her calculations clash with visceral winces at the artifact's keen, and the key's transformation into memory-object crystallizes earned endurance without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the singing marina holding "until next thaw" reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost (key's uselessness as lock), while the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through vibrational escalation to the beacon's relighting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice (sound conduction physics) and charges the final image—glowing floes singing forgiveness—making environment indispensable to closure's resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lira's vibrational matching (agency-driven deepening), with visible cost in the key's melting; the single escalation beat—translating wail to lullaby—reweights the artifact's purpose under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sonic alchemy: "translated grief" becomes "lullaby older than any port," avoiding moralizing while the final beam scattering "seeds of quiet joy" offers non-literal resolution to sorrow's transmission.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("azure-coat lighthouse engineer" noticing resonance frequencies) and rhythmic control shine in "pressed her palms to the ice, felt grief thrumming beneath, a second heart trapped in glass" under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Key sang—a single clear note that pierced the cold air like a needle through silk" risks mixed metaphor (sound piercing air ≠ needle through fabric), slightly muddling a pivotal beat though propulsion remains strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sonic absolution transforms clichéd artifact tropes through specific physics ("ice conducts sorrow differently"), with risk-taking (sound as tangible force) heightening stakes without gimmickry in the drifting-ice cathedral image.</comment>
