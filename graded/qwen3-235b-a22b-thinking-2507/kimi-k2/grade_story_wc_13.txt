<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation (completing the bestiary) drives concrete micro-choices like drawing the infinity symbol, but internal contradiction beyond professional urgency remains underdeveloped. The final choice feels earned, yet lacks layered emotional stakes beyond anticipation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the frozen mirrors showing futures crystallize irreversible cost (city’s eventual collapse) while the bird’s completion offers fleeting triumph. Accumulative lens holds—density peaks as droplets freeze—without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The infinity pendant constrains choices (unlocking the cage) and charges the final image ("pulsed like a heartbeat"). Rooftop canals function as micro-setting, forcing navigation via liquid staircase. Sensory detail (ascending droplets) actively shapes action, not ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Lira’s agency: borrowing time narrows options to a single "stolen second," with visible cost in the paused wind. Escalation under Accumulative lens—density peaks as chord thrashes—reweights the dream’s fragility without coincidence resolving tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the echo-bird’s "unresolved questions," answered non-literally by the portable sketchbook. Final image ("listening for the next skipped beat") reweights the premise with conceptual cost (ephemeral beauty preserved but city doomed), avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "water ran backward, droplets ascending" reflects Lira’s illustrator focus. Rhythmic control intensifies during pressure ("pencil guided by vibrations"), with lyrical compression taught early ("canal system rearranged into liquid light").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but "dripping, droplets" proximity in the staircase description creates a minor synonym loop. Figurative language remains coherent ("chord thrashed like a trapped moth"), though "borrowed future" slightly strains physical logic without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "artist capturing ephemera" through specific world logic: echoes born from architectural hiccups. The glass bird’s "unresolved questions" synthesizes theme and action, while the giant’s nap as temporal framework feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
