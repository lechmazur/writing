<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but edges toward abstraction; "lucidly watchful" label lacks embodied contradiction in pivotal moments despite strong micro-choices like pattern refinement under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("despair was not a constant but a variable"); Accumulative lens holds as balloon trials tighten pressure through pattern density shifts without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Grotto functions as active constraint: coral veins record heartbeats affecting Lira's tactics, tide carries replicated balloons, and basalt's warmth charges the final image with tangible transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through balloon trials' accumulating data (bursting=success), but conceptual cost of redefining despair lacks visceral immediacy despite valid agency in pattern complexity choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "equations for hope" reframed as shared patterns in closure without moralizing; final mirror-tree reweights prior math imagery with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("moonlight dripped like liquid quartz") modulates under stress; rhythmic control tightens during balloon launches while maintaining Accumulative pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion but "lucidly watchful" repetition creates minor scaffold; no closure-dulling artifacts though high-pressure beats risk slight overwriting with "filigree/fractals" density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of math and magic realism ("emotional amplitude" altitudes); specific details like cinnamon-scented war-free timeline prevent abstraction while risking poetic density that pays off in closure.</comment>
