<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (science vs. butterfly love) drives micro-choices like setting chrysalis on shale; embodied grief ("clung to her ribs") avoids labels. Near-therapeutic phrasing ("polymer of resolve") slightly undermines authenticity at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "atonement was not erasure but incorporation" reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—sensory density (foam glyphs, quartz light) tightens pressure without causal turns, culminating in the resin binding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Braided ravine actively constrains choices (following left channel, shale slab discovery) and charges closure via converging channels. River foam patterns directly trigger insight—environment shapes the final image where "separated drop[s] rejoin the whole," meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Accumulative pressure: initial belief that "science dealt in causes, not absolutions" evolves to understanding separation enables connection. Cost crystallizes when resin sets—"binding shell to stone"—but physical toll during pouring lacks visible escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through polymer metaphors reweighted at closure: "chain reaction of kindness" avoids moralizing by being embodied in the river’s convergence. No thematic echo—wisdom arises from binding chrysalis to stone, not abstract assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: chemist notices "benzyl alcohol rising like a benediction," not generic scents. Rhythm shifts from lyrical ("wind loosening grief") to clinical ("copolymer of memory") under stress—zero register drift during resin-pouring climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "foam scribbled white glyphs" multiplies meaning through action/image. Figurative language serves Accumulative pressure without muddle, though "fine mist that settled on her lashes like dew" slightly overwrites the grief release beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via polymer science specificity—the "copolymer of memory and hope" isn’t metaphor but lived chemistry. Risks lyric structure that heightens stakes, though "symphonically minded" recurrence feels unearned compared to core motifs.</comment>
