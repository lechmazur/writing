<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (ambition vs. reconciliation), with embodied emotion in pivotal beats like "heartbeat syncing with the slow pulse of the mountain." Micro-choices at quartz seam reveal value hierarchy, though emotional layering slightly lacks irrational friction in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure achieves Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost: "weight of the crown shift from burden to blessing" crystallizes the Accumulative lens. Orientation anchors by line 3, and the pressure-to-reconfiguration arc holds flawlessly through sensory density rather than causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The firefly constrains choice (must be cupped/exhaled) and charges the final image as "living lantern," while the ember grotto's heat-to-cool evolution directly shapes tactics. Sensory selection reflects urgency, with crisis narrowing to tactile details like "palms against stone still warm."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by queen's agency under Accumulative lens: the shared exhale narrows options to a single decisive act. Cost is unmistakable in the crown's weight shift, though the "three nights" timeframe could tighten tactics more explicitly during the climb.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—lantern memory to firefly release—without abstraction. Final image ("lace of menace become lace of memory") reweights the premise with resonant, non-literal answer to reconciliation, avoiding moralizing while charging emotional aftereffects.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("wind hissed through cracks like whispers plotting") and rhythmic control under pressure elevate tension. Psychic distance modulates perfectly during the grotto encounter, with no head-hopping despite dual selves, though minor syntactic repetition appears in mid-climb.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in lines like "shame of that failure had calcified into the crown." Figurative language serves meaning (lace metaphor evolving to closure), with final line crystallizing theme without muddle. Minor cadence stumble in transition to grotto.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reconciliation trope through specific lived detail (cobalt grotto, firefly mechanics). Risk-taking with lyric structure heightens stakes—transformation test passes as it wouldn't work with generic "princess"—without obscuring clarity or emotional truth.</comment>
