<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's embodied contradictions shine: pragmatic marble-polishing ritual reveals her value hierarchy under pressure, though the queen's internal shift lacks sufficient micro-choices to fully earn her transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully—the buried marble's cost (device shattering, queen's tear-sap) crystallizes the garden's logic with undeniable conceptual cost; Accumulative lens holds flawlessly through the wisteria's rebirth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cracked marbles function as micro-setting, constraining Lira's choices (left fork decision) and charging the final image—roots growing through the split marble make environment inseparable from thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Lira's marble ritual (polishing as commemoration), narrowing options via the split marble's burial; cost is visible in the queen's physical reaction but slightly rushed in emotional escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment><comment>Theme emerges through the marbles' reweighted meaning: "some deceptions must stay in earth to hold truth up" avoids moralizing while the final vine-crone image delivers non-literal answer to memory's persistence without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dew like hesitant stars," "perfume so sweet it felt like a lie") modulates rhythm under pressure; psychic distance shifts intentionally during marble stories without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "blooming withering" oxymoron risks overwriting but earns density by charging the queen's crisis—only minor cadence stiffness in transition to the bench scene prevents 9.0+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "garden magic" trope through measurable luck framework; the mended-deception marble as living truth-teller feels inevitable yet fresh, with specificity (stolen grape marble color) avoiding abstraction.</comment>
