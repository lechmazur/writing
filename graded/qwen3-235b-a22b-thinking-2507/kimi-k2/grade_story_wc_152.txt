<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through Mira’s "fool" mask; micro-choices like deliberate blood pricks reveal her value hierarchy under pressure. Final renunciation of silence (stitching escape routes) earns closure through prior causality. No stock phrasing—embodied emotion in "humming lullabies to her needle" amid crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is Charged Poise: chart aligned with wick reconfigures options with undeniable cost (blood pricks, time spent). Accumulative lens holds—pressure tightens via candle’s flame direction and moonset deadline. Cost proof: "blood soaked into the cloth, blooming into a red star" legibly charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Eternal candle and embroidery hoop function as micro-setting, constraining choices (reading threads via flame) and charging closure (chart beneath lens). Sensory details like "leaves scraping the dome like dry wings" evolve causally with plot. Environment directly shapes tactics—no ornamental description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mira’s agency: reweaving chart narrows options as third moonset approaches. Cost is visible (deliberate finger pricks, exhaustion) and reweights stakes under Accumulative lens. "Flame leaned east" deepens knowledge, forcing her to "unravel the pattern," but one tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of disguised wisdom emerges through concrete action (blood ciphers, fool’s mask), not abstraction. Final image—"candle flame cradled in an open hand"—resonantly answers central question without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; complexity lingers via "unheard stories" motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is embroidery-centric ("silver thread trembling like starlight"), with rhythmic control under pressure ("Footsteps approached—soft, conspiratorial—but paused"). Voice modulates from lyrical to urgent; no POV slippage. Compression taught early via "echoed silence" pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("adjacent possibilities unfolded: threads loosened, re-formed") propels without muddle. Minor overwriting in "bruised blue as the autumn sky" but consistent with voice. Final line’s "future begin" avoids sentimentality, charging closure with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms espionage tropes through embroidery-as-cipher, making conspiracies tangible. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable: "duke’s smile became a crooked dagger" grounds abstraction. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity—closure’s "sky rearranged" is earned.</comment>
