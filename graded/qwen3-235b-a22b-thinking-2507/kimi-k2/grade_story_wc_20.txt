<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "cracks must be honored instead of erased" vs alchemical impulse to recast; micro-choices like breathing on coin reveal value hierarchy. Emotional progression avoids tidy resolution through embodied "guilt heavier than lead" but slightly over-articulated epiphany in "transformation was not a single transmutation".</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost in "weight settle not as burden but as ballast"; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through mercury/lacquer transformations. Backstory integration (Aquarius flood) risks BRR violation but anchors present via micro-choice of crucible alignment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Crucible crack constrains every choice—coin alignment, mercury pour, lacquer application—and charges final image as "constellation bridge". Rain-washed state actively shapes action (hissing puddles, cooling metal), fulfilling 9+ gate for micro-setting driving closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake crystallization ("redeem the name") tightens through coin's Libra→Scorpio→Leo shifts driven by Elara's agency; cost legible in "luminous regret" beading and final weight reconfiguration. Single deepening (exploring limits) suffices for length but lacks secondary pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through kintsugi seam becoming "map of constellations," rejecting erasure for transformed weight; final image reweights "bruise" into "ballast" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo while making grief's cost undeniable through alloyed gold drop.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in alchemist's precision ("powdered starlight," "mercury beading like luminous regret") but "factually mystical" slightly jars lexicon. Rhythmic control under pressure exceptional, with lyric compression taught early and paid off in closure's crystalline simplicity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "luminous regret" achieves high density without muddle. Minor register drift in "factually mystical" (alchemist voice justifies it) prevents 9.0. Final line's "first true measure" avoids sentimentality through concrete "ballast" metaphor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes kintsugi and zodiac mechanics into non-obvious emotional calculus; "luminous regret" transforms generic grief trope. Risk-taking (Accumulative lens in mystical context) heightens stakes without gimmickry, with crucible crack as indispensable anchor.</comment>
