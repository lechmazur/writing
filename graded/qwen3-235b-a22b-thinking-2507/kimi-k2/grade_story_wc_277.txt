<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (observing vs. intervening) act simultaneously as she calculates decay; micro-choices like tasting the meteorite iron reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost ("iron of meteorite justice"). No therapy-speak; embodied emotion in "laughter quaked" during emotional crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when satellite vanishes—cost legible in "eyes moist, yet feeling oddly light" and scattered fragments. Causal lens holds: her drag-coefficient proof directly causes decay. Minor flaw: journalist's arrival timing slightly convenient, but doesn't undermine mathematical causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Telescope and rosewood pen constrain choices: meteorite iron enables proof, "operatic sigh" of dome mirrors emotional state. Final image ("meteorite kiss") recharges brass fittings opening motif. Micro-setting (eyepiece adjustments) directly alters tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: her proof narrows options to mathematical intervention. Cost unmistakable in tasted iron and "smaller confessions" fragments. Escalation driven by her calculation ("subtracted drag coefficients"), not coincidence—fragments deepen stakes without resolving them.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "orbits of regret" becomes literal satellite, then mathematical problem. Ending offers resonant answer via "smaller doubts into null hypotheses"—no moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; complexity in "regret might scatter" lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "starlight stitched silver footprints" filters observation through journalist's lens. Syntax mirrors precision ("red, then blue, then green"). Dialogue shows status shift when journalist arrives breathless—subtext in "hidden truths" question. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; metaphors serve function ("brassy ink" ties to telescope brass). Minor paraphrase loop: "devotedly observant" repeats twice. Elevated diction ("elegant violence of thought") fits POV lexicon—no overwriting in peak beats. Closure image crystal clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Synthesizes journalism, astronomy, and regret uniquely: "proof by contradiction" transforms abstract shame into orbital mechanics. Transformation test passed—it wouldn't work with different names. Risk distinction: mathematical resolution avoids clichéd confrontation, heightening thematic stakes.</comment>
