<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses crystallize in the boy's trembling yet steady voice and the woman's knuckle-whitening grip; final choices ("I still believe"/"write better ones") earn closure through prior causality with visceral cost in the snapped cords.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds through moon-phase synchronization triggering the cord snap; Earned Stasis closure lands with undeniable cost (broken cords, lingering scents) as the characters' authentic exchange forecloses the ritual's path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Brass drawer pull functions as micro-setting: constrains choices during regret-naming and charges the final image with its mirror-bright surface reflecting Mara's furrowed face under the half-moon.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mara's agency (imposing "no apology" rule) and the boy's mid-walk reversal; cost is unmistakable in the cords snapping like a sigh after his vulnerable declaration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image of burnt cloth and wet ink reweights "recycling mistakes" without moralizing; the woman's "write better ones" reframes the boy's regret through concrete action, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "sailors read clouds" and "mist folded like a page turning"; rhythmic compression under pressure ("Mara nodded once") maintains distinct voice without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "silver threads singing against the wind" does triple duty (sensory, tension, metaphor); only minor overwriting in "penitent's shawl" doesn't dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prisoner exchange with regret-naming ritual: brass pull mechanic transforms trope through specific stakes (cords snapping at insincerity), avoiding safety-middle with morally ambiguous cost.</comment>
