<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (river vs. dose) drive the confession; embodied guilt in "taste of iron and mint" avoids therapy-speak; micro-choice of tearing the map earns renunciation with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost ("lighter by exactly the weight"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds from "counting sleepers" to final tape ritual; orientation anchors in first sentence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Disused station actively constrains choices: ivy reveals the bench, rusted bell chimes at confession; "platform is your sternum" charges the final image with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single stake (self-forgiveness) deepens through protagonist's agency: counting sleepers → whispering name → tearing map; "taste of iron" makes cost unmistakable under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (tearing map, placing tape); final image "path to self-forgiveness is a track you lay by leaving" reweights railway motif without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("river chronicler" measuring sleepers like currents) persists under pressure; "trapped sparrow" chord shows rhythmic control; no head-hopping in lyric compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; "green tongues licking rust" exemplifies high-density propulsion; minor abstraction in "raw solace distilled" saved by preceding concrete details.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms abandonment tropes via river chronicler lens; map-to-scar synthesis feels inevitable; "path you lay by leaving" offers fresh inflection on forgiveness.</comment>
