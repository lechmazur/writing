<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("honesty hurts because it adds nothing") and embodied emotion ("feeling strangely unmasked") deepen motivation, but predecessor's sudden appearance lacks full causal grounding for his change, slightly weakening earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("truth weighs more, but easier to carry than secrets") under Accumulative/Textural lens; density shift from doodles to ledger reconfiguration reweights stakes perfectly within scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt actively constrains choices (puddles as mirrors, stone "whispering") and charges final image; lens functions as micro-setting that reshapes tactics, meeting 9+ gate requirement flawlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Protagonist's eavesdropping and lens use drive escalation under Accumulative lens; "I altered figures for twenty years" discovery creates irreversible trade-off with visible cost in ledger corrections, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (ledger exchange, lens symbolism) without moralizing; final image of "fragments spliced by the same hand" offers resonant non-literal answer to honesty's cost, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("droplets slide like silent apologies") and rhythmic control peak during moonlight scene; elision of backstory taught early and paid off via ticket stubs, fulfilling 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with "frost seems to melt from carved faces" slightly mixed metaphor (-0.1) but closure image remains razor-sharp, meeting near-perfect 9+ criteria.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms reconciliation trope through specific objects (projector lens, concert tickets); "ambiguously clear" motif synthesizes emotional/physical stakes inevitably, with risk-taking heightening coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
