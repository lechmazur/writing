<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "mournfully eager" and trembling grip, but grief-as-dust abstraction edges toward label-speak in peak moments. Final smile earned through prior causality with visible oil-smear cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds perfectly: sound density escalates from cough to overlapping roars. Charged Poise closure lands with undeniable cost—the blower's cooling ticks as unfinished joke syllables.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Brick tunnel constrains every choice (nozzle scraping floor, moonlight as notes) and charges the final image—exhaling the punchline. Micro-setting essential to closure's sonic physics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through ignition attempts; deepening crystallizes when Elara realizes the house must "laugh at its own sorrow." Cost legible in grandfather's stroke-silenced speech and the blower's dying fuel.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sound physics ("macerated laughter"), not abstraction. Final leaf-spinning image answers "how to restore laughter" without moralizing—grief transformed into "confetti" dreams.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: notices "pale, quivering notes" of moonlight, "confetti" of grief. Rhythmic compression under pressure ("She yanked once; the engine coughed, refused") avoids uniformity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "macerated into the walls" avoids cliché. Only minor drift: "grief like dust no duster could lift" slightly overwrought, but peak beats ("blower roared awake") pulse with clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: leaf blower as grief-conduit transforms haunting tropes. Risk-taking (sound-based resurrection) heightens stakes—emotional specificity in "laughter... ground so fine" avoids generic mourning.</comment>
