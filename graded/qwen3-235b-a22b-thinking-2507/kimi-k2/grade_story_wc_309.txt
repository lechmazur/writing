<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices (bare feet on ice as first impossibility), but flaw complexity lacks depth beyond "underachiever." Final renunciation of extraordinary aspirations earns closure with visible cost ("lighter than air"), though secondary pressure is absent per scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: spire dissolving after Elian leaves the ordinary keystone reconfigures the central question with undeniable cost. Accumulative lens holds via sensory density escalation (luminous footprints → solidified bridge), though one tightening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the keystone’s "wet earth" scent and shrinking light constrain every choice, charging the final image where it lies "beside a trowel, now nothing." Spire’s glassy flank directly enables the barefoot impossibility, meeting 9+ gate through causal pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (surrendering extraordinary dreams) tightens through Elian’s agency—unstrapping crampons crystallizes his stance. Cost is unmistakable when failures "dissolved into the mist," but external pressure remains underdeveloped per accumulative lens allowances.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete action: "sacred in the simple is not a discovery but a surrender" gains weight via keystone’s ordinary return to soil. Final image reweights the spire’s purpose without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite Elian’s explicit realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("air shimmered with brilliant dimness," "clouds smelled of graphite") modulates rhythm under pressure—lyrical during mist walking, clipped at climax. Minor deduction for rare elevated diction ("regret" in mist walking) slightly straining mage’s voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cold shot through him like forgotten music" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Figurative language never muddles closure—keystone’s "salt and snow" taste crystallizes cost without overwriting. One near-duplicate phrase in cloud descent limits perfection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis: "garden folly keystone" transforms automation critique into visceral emotional anchor. Risk-taking (accumulative structure with quiet closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry—"tomatoes glowed like small suns" grounds universals in unforgettable specificity.</comment>
