<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "banking fire into embers" while risking broadcast; embodied hesitation with the boy shows visible cost. Final choice to persist earns endurance through salvaged fragments' causal weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "erasing footprints but not the ripples" reconfigures memory's cost with undeniable conceptual weight. Accumulative lens holds via lagoon's mineral constraint shaping transmission tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Auric lagoon's mineral-rich water isn't backdrop but active constraint—enables broadcast transmission and charges final image through "ripples of her voice." Micro-setting (puddle reflections) dictates pathfinding tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency: letting the boy pass demonstrates cost (missed connection), tightening stakes via "mercy could be a louder alarm." Conceptual cost ("tyranny feeds on forgetting") is unmistakable in broadcast's ripple imagery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through bus ticket/matchbook particulars; final image ("ripples of her voice") offers non-literal answer to memory's persistence without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo via concrete transmission act.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: notices "drowned city" in water, compresses stress into "counted heartbeats." Rhythmic control elevates tension ("She became stillness itself") without voice slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; "mineral-rich water like a secret current" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Final line recharges "ripples" motif with crystalline clarity—no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms phone booth trope through TelStar key's physical mechanics (mineral water transmission). Emotional specificity in "banking fire into embers" avoids generic resistance narratives.</comment>
