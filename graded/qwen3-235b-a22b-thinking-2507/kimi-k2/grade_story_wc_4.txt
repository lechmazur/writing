<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority crystallizes through embodied micro-choices (whispering names, feeling soil's warmth), avoiding abstraction; contradictory impulses act simultaneously in the archivist's calm endurance versus active transmutation, earning her cyclical departure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the "living manuscript" final image reweights grief's purpose with conceptual cost ("harvested and replanted season after season"), holding the Accumulative/Textural lens through the spiral's evolution into a "galaxy fallen to earth" with irrevocable stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lavender field constrains every choice—photos arc like sheet music, stalks grow "tallest where fragrant," soil absorbs memories—and charges the closure as "laughter sounded richer," with sensory specificity (bergamot, iron scent) woven into action under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens: adding photographs deepens the spiral's resonance, narrowing the archivist's role to witness rather than healer; cost crystallizes when "tears smelled of lavender," making emotional transformation tangible through scent and sound under sustained pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete accumulation: "masterpieces are not objects but processes" crystallizes via the field's transformation, avoiding moralizing; the final image of children playing offers a resonant, non-literal answer to transmutation with "scraped knees healed faster" as earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("vines climbed... green fingers curling like signatures") modulates rhythm under pressure; voice remains anchored in archivist's sensory bias ("bergamot," "iron scent"), with lyric compression taught early and paid off in the "nautilus of grief" closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("black-and-white constellations that charted collective healing") with strategic figurative language; closure beat ("vines climbed again") avoids muddle, though "silvering" slightly risks ambiguity in peak transformation without sufficient tactile grounding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief as collective topography: transforming pain into "luminescence" through photographic arcs feels inevitable yet non-obvious, with risk-taking (lyric structure, no decisive action) heightening stakes without gimmickry, resisting generic "healing" tropes through soil-specific details.</comment>
