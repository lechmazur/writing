<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prince Halric's contradictory impulses (preserving the egg vs. accepting destruction) manifest in micro-choices like whispering to the shell and assembling relics, avoiding therapy-speak. Motivation for reawakening beauty is embodied through silk pouch and "bitterly sweet ache," though mother's wedding gown backstory lacks causal weight in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: palace destruction and Halric's transformation crystallize "beauty must be chosen" under Hybrid lens. Stalactite failures drive escalation, but the bird's thematic line ("must be chosen, again and again") risks slight echo without deeper integration into Halric's final action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Suspended palace actively constrains choices—tilting table forces steadying, chandeliers signal imminent collapse. Copper vines and egg's cracks evolve from oppressive to transformative, charging the final image where sparks "soften into seeds." Only minor dilution via "reckless reds and blues" generic phrasing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (beauty vs. mechanization) tighten causally: each stalactite crack narrows options until Halric's leap reweights everything. His hypothesis-driven assembly creates meaningful deepening, and the conceptual cost—realizing artificers "killed the choosing"—is unmistakable when he presses the bird to his heart.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "choosing" motif crystallizes when Halric leaps, reweighting prior material via sparks becoming pollen. Avoids moralizing, but "flawed genesis" risks abstraction until embodied in the egg's transformation. Final image offers resonant answer without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "quaking reverie of heartbeat," limestone as "pale moths." Syntax modulates perfectly under pressure—short staccato during collapse ("The palace lurched; a stalactite snapped"). Minor filter-verb slip in "Halric felt" twice, but voice remains distinct and controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion flawless as "sparks spread outward" reactivates the valley. "Embryonic star still burning inside" borders purple prose but is redeemed by payoff. Final line’s "empty shell" creates lyrical ambiguity without muddling closure. One generic phrase ("rebellious reds") barely touches closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms mechanical dystopia via "hypothesizing" prince-scientist angle. Beauty’s return as "messy growth" (not perfect restoration) avoids cliché. Risk-taking heightens stakes: Charged Poise closure makes mechanical world’s redemption feel earned through specific, irreversible choices.</comment>
