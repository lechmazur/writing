<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s simultaneous awe and terror of the orchard, embodied through crystalline petal crunching and stardust vomiting. Final choice to become guardian is earned by memory-peeling cost, though bathroom method feels slightly under-motivated as a "quirk not method."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: memories peeling like petals as she becomes eternal curator. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through "brightened disquiet" pattern; disorientation taught early via mirror doors pays off in the final orchard dimming.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Astral orchard’s starlight trees directly constrain choice—Elara must press the cameo into bark to feed memories. The pistachio shell’s evolution from blank seed to screaming cameo charges the final image, avoiding static symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara’s agency: her inquiry of trees triggers self-vomiting stardust, forcing the seed realization. Cost is visceral in memory-peeling, though "forbidden knowledge" motivation could deepen earlier beyond predecessor’s screams.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the Codex’s rewriting as "footnote" and cameo’s transformation—knowledge as cyclical choice, not truth. Final image ("Ask me anything") resonates without moralizing, reweighting inheritance as simultaneous loss and gift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: "crunching crystalline petals," "ultraviolet panic" filter reality through curator’s awe. Bathroom method’s "absurd porcelain cube" modulates voice under pressure; no head-hopping despite time folds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; "vomited stardust" shows visceral cost. Minor overwriting in "simply complicated" (telling vs. showing), but "bark etched with names of every curator who had come before" delivers high-density propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms time-loop tropes through specific, character-rooted mechanics: pistachio shell as inherited seed, orchard as memory-fed Codex. "Brightened disquiet" evolves from atmospheric to ultraviolet panic, avoiding generic cosmic awe.</comment>
