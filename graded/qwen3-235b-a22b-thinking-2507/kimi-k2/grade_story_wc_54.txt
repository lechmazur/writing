<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied engineering choices ("tracing vectors," rerouting flows), but "curious civil engineer intern" trait lacks contradictory impulses or struggle under pressure; no visible cost to her competence during technical actions weakens micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: terminal "breathing" crystallizes the shift from abandonment to arrivals with undeniable cost ("passengers would never return"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with sextant’s evolution driving the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Terminal setting functions as micro-setting: baggage-belt hum and dry fountain constrain choices (redirecting flows), charging the final image where bioluminescent vines replace carnival lights; starlight-as-sugar detail exemplifies tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single escalation (hum intensifying to water flow) narrows options through Mara’s agency, with felt cost in "passengers never return." Dominant stake (reversing abandonment) tightens coherently under Accumulative lens, though no trade-off during rerouting limits depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "hope is a vector" reweights engineering into emotional logic via sextant redirecting water, not abstraction. Final image (brass bloom among living flowers) resonates without moralizing, embracing complexity of loss-as-potential.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("starlight pooled like spilled sugar," "vibrations of baggage belts") modulates under pressure; lyric compression taught early pays off in closure. Minor dip when "functionally creative" interrupts voice with label-speak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("murals of distant worlds painted by children who had passed through decades ago"). "Stanza in a stoic wonder" risks overwriting but saved by motif integration. Final line’s carnival ticket sketch delivers propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of engineering and lyricism: sextant as hope-vector transforms abandonment trope. Risk-taking (terminal as living sextant) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "carnival laughter" proximity to familiar motifs caps ingenuity.</comment>
