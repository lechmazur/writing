<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Protagonist lacks contradictory impulses; motivation to "understand houses" remains observational without tested stakes. Widow interaction hints at relationship potential but underdeveloped. Interiority relies on poetic description over embodied conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: tide pausing mid-breath crystallizes houses' "life as echo of absence" with visible cost (shard left behind). Accumulative lens holds through object sanctification sequence. Minor deduction for note's handwriting reveal feeling slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting constrains every choice: orris shard's violet dust, displaced objects (marble/mitten/compass), and lilacs' "sugar and thunder" scent directly charge closure. Sensory details reflect urgency—crisis narrows to "heartbeat and footfall," calm admits "rain inside drawers."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding house-aliveness) lacks concrete opposition or escalation. Pressure accumulates through ritual but no palpable resistance; "cost" remains abstract (shard's completion) without tradeoffs during sanctification. Tide timing hints at live clock but unused.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "life is not opposite of absence but its echo" crystallizes from marble/mitten/compass. Final image ("hushed blaze warming spring night") reweights premise without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality via "grief from turning into haunting" specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "streetlights daydreamed," "hush smelled of sugar and thunder." Rhythm modulates with ritual—longer cadences during sanctification, clipped phrases at climax ("tide pausing mid-breath"). Zero head-hopping; compression taught early ("cedar shingles silvered to moonlit water").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "paper lanterns," "ancient conversation with moon" do triple duty. Final line propulsion flawless. One borderline metaphor ("hush absorbed gulls' sounds") risks overwriting but serves Accumulative lens. Proofreading impeccable—no artifacts near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms haunted-house trope through "shard of hush" mechanic and grief-as-sanctification. Emotional truth in houses "stitched from absences" avoids cliché. Risk-taking (silence as active force) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Missing one fresh inflection for 9.0+.</comment>
