<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("shivering bliss" amid guilt) and embodied emotion (trembling gauntlets, walnut-to-skin shift) drive the desertion epiphany. Micro-choice of unsnapping the puppet's throat reconfigures Calen's stance with visceral cost, though the theater program's purpose revelation leans slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: the vow's transformation from "withdrawn" to "dancing in open air" crystallizes the reality-stitching premise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly—the sap-cords' braiding and branching dawns reweight stakes through sensory accumulation, not causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard constrains every choice: phosphor-apples' violet glow guides perception, glass gutters channel sap into harp strings, and the crate's location forces kneeling. Crucially, the greenhouse melting into "dew" charges the final image with scent-driven specificity ("thunderclouds and ripe apples").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Calen recognizes the choreography as his desertion gesture, transforming internal conflict into physical action (unsnap). The Accumulative escalation—sap braiding into regret-geometry cords—reweights the "shape of possibility" with felt cost, though "as reality shifts" lacks tactical urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: sap-cords "grafting possibility to sinew" and the dancing vow reconfigure performance as reality-stitching without moralizing. Final image ("murmured allegiance... dancing in open air") resonantly answers the opening withdrawal, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("phosphor-apples," "runic loops") filters all details through Calen's alchemical-theatrical lens. Rhythmic control peaks in transformation beats ("walnut become warm skin"), with purposeful compression taught early ("cedar and old greasepaint" scent anchoring possibility).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels the textural accumulation ("petals of light peeling," "silver cords whipping inward"). Final image recharges the opening with surgical precision: "dancing, finally, in the open air" crystallizes the vow's evolution without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis: alchemical orchard + marionette theater transforms "knight's redemption" tropes through specific logic (sap as regret-geometry, performance as reality-stitching). Risk-taking (lyric closure, conceptual stakes) heightens coherence—the branching dawns feel inevitable from the "shape of possibility" motif.</comment>
