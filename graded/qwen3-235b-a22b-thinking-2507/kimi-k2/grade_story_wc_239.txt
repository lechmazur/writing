<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract despite cosmic stakes; "memories not her own flooded her" lacks embodied contradiction. Final renunciation of separation illusion earns closure but micro-choices lack tactile specificity under pressure. No second character limits relationship crucible application.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "the witness and the witnessed were the same" reconfigures cosmic division. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density increase ("shelves collapsing into sentences"), though "universe's hiccup" repetition risks template cadence. Cost legible in swallowed dot's transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dictionary functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (aligning "unify" with vacuum quill) and charges final image (pulse in hand). Petrified dawn lectern and event-horizon mirror provide tactile specificity, but cosmic scale occasionally overrides spatial choreography ("aisles curved into itself").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ending cosmic division) tightens through dictionary's erasure and library's negotiable distances. Agency drives escalation via "journeying inward while walking out" choice, with conceptual cost paid in fragmented selfhood. Spiral arbitration's luminous coils reweight pressure without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: dictionary's vanishing words reweight "unify" into a black hole of meaning. Final image ("cosmos read itself aloud") resonates without moralizing, embracing complexity through "wanderingly exact" recurrence. No thematic echo despite high-concept premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tessellated floor that remembered every footfall that had never happened") sustains under pressure. Rhythmic control in "resounding hush" repetitions teaches pattern early; "wanderingly exact" cadence mirrors cosmic spiral. Zero POV leakage despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or synonym loops; "hiccup" repetition functions as taught pattern. Final line achieves high density ("carrying the hush, the spiral, and the softcover dictionary"). Slight overwriting risk in "snowflakes of meaning" mitigated by earned payoff in swallowed dot.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic library tropes through specific constraints: dictionary's entropy-driven obsolescence transforms "unify" from word to black hole. Emotional truth in "fragments into narrative possibilities" avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (spiral arbitration as jurisprudence) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
