<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Embodied grief anchors micro-choices (tracing glyphs, pressing anchor link) with contradictory impulses—duty vs alien navigation—driving the dive. Wife’s helmet quote earns motivation without therapy-speak, though micro-choices thin during the dive climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "horizon" in wife’s handwriting reweights navigation from escape to recognition, making grief part of the sky. Accumulative lens holds via glyph density shifts, with "pressure felt like forgiveness" crystallizing the cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Benthic city actively constrains choices: silt preserves boot prints, glyphs rearrange in water, and anchor link’s weight becomes a sextant. Micro-setting (chain link) charges closure as compass, fulfilling 9+ gate by shaping tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single stake—navigating by living constellations vs dead satellites—tightens via glyph interaction, narrowing options to the trench dive. Agency-driven escalation culminates in the dive’s cost (time thinned, city inverted), though visible price lacks minor tactical alteration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "stars that shine from the bottom up" reweights grief as navigation without moralizing. Final image rejects binaries, making abyss "another sky" with resonant ambiguity—no thematic echo, earned through her transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: navigation jargon ("sextant," "bearings") filters sensory details. Rhythmic control under pressure ("pressure felt like forgiveness") avoids head-hopping; lyric compression taught early pays off in closure’s water-sphere vision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "rust flaking away to reveal mirrored facets" does triple duty. One minor paraphrase loop ("unfolded horizons folded again") in dive sequence loses 0.1, but closure beat remains artifact-free with crystalline "clipped the anchor link to her belt, a compass now."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via benthic navigation metaphor—"bottom-up stars" feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking (lyric escalation over causal turns) heightens stakes coherently; specificity ("sonar ghosts," "tectonic sigh") avoids generic abstraction.</comment>
