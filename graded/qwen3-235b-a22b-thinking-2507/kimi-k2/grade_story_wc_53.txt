<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (trading regret vs preserving memory) drive choices, but chronological confusion remains atmospheric rather than shaping tactics during pivotal trades with ghosts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully when carousel turns backward—surrendered stories sink as cost, yet disorientation past 120 words slightly weakens spatial anchor despite functional payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting (camera wheel) charges the final image, but kinetic lagoon remains postcard backdrop; environment never constrains choices despite vivid "fractured stillness" texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through ghost negotiations, but escalation leans on external pressure (carousel shudders) rather than protagonist-driven choices; cost of releasing stories is visible yet not fully tactic-altering.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image reweights ambition through eroded paint and backward motion—no moralizing, just the coin and "cracked smile" answering whether regret can be traded without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "hiccups in a broken clock" and brass horses' steam, but "chronologically confused" slips into label-speak during high-pressure negotiation beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero closure-tainting artifacts; "REGRET dissolving into fragments" avoids figurative muddle, though minor scaffold appears in kneeling description ("letting... began collecting").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Carousel-as-regret-engine transforms tropes through backward motion and eroded paint, but "scavenger of abandoned dreams" edges toward cliché without sufficient fresh inflection.</comment>
