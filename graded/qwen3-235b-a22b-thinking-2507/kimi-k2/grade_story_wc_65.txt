<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("create rather than correct") crystallizes in the final sigil choice; embodied cost in "some doors forever closed" with kingfisher analogy avoiding abstraction. Flawless micro-choices like frost-breathing to overcome vellum resistance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: icegrass roots following melt patterns make conceptual cost undeniable under Accumulative lens. Spire's "memory of every eruption" anchors constraint-driven partnership, avoiding easy miracle while reweighting innovation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frozen lake constrains every choice—vellum curls on ice, frost crystals enable modeling—and charges closure via singing ice. Obsidian spire’s warmth/memory actively resists and collaborates, never static backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when constraint forces final sigil ("some paths unchosen"), with kingfisher dive analogy crystallizing cost. Spire’s partnership offer deepens pressure by tethering innovation to geological memory, no coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through icegrass roots and closed-loop energy sigil, not statement. Final image reweights "prevail" as collaboration without moralizing, while "disciplined dreaming" avoids platitude via embodied cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "vellum resisted, curling" mirrors cartographer’s struggle; rhythmic control in "roots teach soil" under pressure. Zero POV drift, with frost geometry revealing data as character-particular noticing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Groundedly imaginative" edges toward abstraction but saved by "refusing easy miracle" action. Otherwise pristine: "scratching frost into frost" compresses physics/effort, zero loops. Final line’s "singing lake" avoids cliché through tactile creaking.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "writing the future" trope via predictive modeling on ice. Risk-taking in equations-as-stepping-stones feels inevitable; icegrass payoff synthesizes constraint/innovation without gimmickry.</comment>
