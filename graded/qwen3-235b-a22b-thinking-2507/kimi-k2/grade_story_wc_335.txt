<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via combative tenderness—sharpens to a point during the tea-drinking ultimatum ("refuse, and we both remain ghosts") while embodying resilience as quiet persistence. Final choice to turn forward earns causality through the shadow’s reintegration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tea-leaf density and shadow resistance tighten pressure toward Charged Poise closure. Cost crystallizes palpably when Lira feels "the tremor of newfound weight" on the girl’s shoulder, reconfiguring stewardship as irreversible burden.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tea leaves function as micro-setting that charges closure—rearranging into a spiral staircase directly enables the descent. Final image of dust cyclones greeting the child weaponizes atmosphere to manifest resilience’s tangible cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via the swing’s creak as live clock, narrowing options to the tea ritual’s success. Escalation peaks when the shadow hesitates at the cup, forcing Lira’s ultimatum; cost lands in the girl’s "tremor of newfound weight" as stewardship begins.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "resilience is not loud but relentless" crystallizes in Lira’s backwards walking and tea-leaf geometry. Final image reweights exile’s cost without moralizing—stewardship’s weight replaces abstract resilience with embodied responsibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in tannin-encoded memory and "dust motes drift like slow constellations." Rhythmic control shifts from fragmented whispers during annotation to flowing cadence at the staircase’s revelation, teaching elision through the shadow’s flickering resistance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line charges momentum ("steam coils around her wrists like shackles dissolving"). Figurative language intensifies pressure without muddle—the raven quill stylus’s "corrections to memory encoded in tannin" fuses tool and theme flawlessly in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms exile tropes via tea-leaf geometry and backwards walking—resilience as annotated ritual, not triumph. Fresh synthesis: "reversible exile" requires mirror/memory/mentor, making the shadow’s ink-like pour into the saucer feel inevitable yet revelatory.</comment>
