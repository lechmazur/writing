<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between watchful dye master and becoming permeable drives closure; embodied emotion via donor heart's pulse and iridescent hues mapping Lira's life. Final renunciation of watchfulness earns cost through wing's crumbling and heart alignment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: "quietly explosive truth" crystallizes options with conceptual cost (wing's destruction, borrowed stories braiding). Orientation clear by 100 words; lens taught via sun-trail accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Blue morpho wing as micro-setting constrains every choice—from angling light to stepping through—and charges final image (empty glass, sunrise). Sensory hierarchy reflects dye master's expertise: color mapping overrides generic mist descriptions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (magnetizing stories) tightens via protagonist's agency: sun-trail tracking deepens knowledge, forcing trade-off between observation and permeability. Cost legible in wing's exhaustion and heart's lurch, reweighting options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "resonance, not attraction" crystallized in final line without moralizing. Conceptual repricing lands via liquid-sapphire stories threading veins, reweighting "iridescent caution" from warning to beacon with emotional cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: dye master's color-centric lexicon ("cerulean that split into violet") modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control shifts from scientific ("tracing sun trails") to poetic ("stories threading into veins") without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor synonym churn ("quietly explosive yet utterly silent" → "quietly explosive truth") avoids major loops. High density maintained except final paragraph's slight abstraction; closure image ("sunrise spilling across empty glass") remains vivid and propulsion intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms donor-heart trope through dye master's color-based epistemology. Risk-taking (memory spiral via light refraction) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "borrowed heartbreak dye the fabric of self" synthesizes theme with organic inevitability.</comment>
