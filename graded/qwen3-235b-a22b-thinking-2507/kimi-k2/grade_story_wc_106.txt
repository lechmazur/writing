<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in the thief’s duality—stealing portraits yet releasing them—with embodied emotion (jar as "second heartbeat") and micro-choices like the spiral flower code. Final renunciation feels earned through her realization that portraits are "questions posed to the dark," avoiding epiphanies via stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: releasing portraits reconfigures her stance with felt cost ("pockets lighter, heart strangely full"). Accumulative lens holds throughout, but the "destiny’s door" metaphor slightly softens the conceptual cost’s legibility at the climax, preventing a 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Emerald station’s green-shard light actively constrains choices—stealing moments "if she were fast enough"—and charges the final image (clock resuming, station dimming ordinary). Recurring moonbeams and jar function as micro-setting, directly shaping tactics and closure’s luminous disbelief.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Internal stake (stealing vs. releasing beauty) tightens through agency-driven accumulation, culminating in the release ritual’s visible cost. Escalation lacks one incremental trade-off (e.g., fatigue or risk) during portrait captures to deepen the pressure before the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "luminous disbelief" evolves from flower-code currency to the thief’s transformed state, reweighted by the dawn’s ordinary radiance. No moralizing—final image answers the central question with resonant ambiguity, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("laughter scattering like sparks," scent "like cold coins") and rhythmic control shine under pressure; lyric compression taught early ("pockets heavy with stolen light") pays off in closure. Zero head-hopping or register drift, even in high-stakes release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose avoids loops with high density ("boots silent on dew-slick tiles" advancing character and atmosphere), but one near-duplicate ("each illuminated moment slid into the jar, layering like translucent petals") slightly dulls propulsion in a mid-beat, blocking 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "thief" trope through specific mechanics (moonflower codes, jar-as-heartbeat), with emotional truth in her shift from taking to releasing. Freshness anchored in verifiable details like cinnamon-tasting secrets, avoiding derivative safety.</comment>
