<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene: Mara's tactile profession fuels both her precision in noticing gravity shifts and her visceral need to recover fragmented memories. Final choice to taste the memory is earned by the coffee-ground divination and descent, with cost legible in the fleeting "corridor" not full restoration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: gravity's stabilization into "calm before a story begins" reconfigures the memory hunt's stakes, while "the taste opened a corridor" implies both access and fragility. Accumulative lens holds throughout via sensory density escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Salt crystal chamber functions as indispensable micro-setting: its gravity fluctuations constrain Mara's movement (kneeling to feel weight shift) and directly charge the closure image where steadied gravity enables the memory-tasting corridor. Every detail serves the memory-capture mechanic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist-driven textural deepening: Mara's agency in reading coffee grounds transforms abstract "need to know" into actionable descent. Cost is unmistakable in closure—the lemon memory offers only a transient "corridor," not restoration, reweighting the hunt's meaning under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Final image of tasting the memory delivers resonant non-literal answer to "where deleted memories go," reweighting salt crystallization as both prison and conduit. Theme emerges purely through particulars—no moralizing, only the cost of temporary access in "corridor back to childhood kitchen."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in profession-rooted details: "measured darkness in wicks," gravity shifts felt "only someone who measured darkness" could detect. Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure—fragmented clauses during whale collapse yield to lyrical flow in the cavern without POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding or loops; every line advances multiple elements. "Petals tugging at her palms like tiny magnets" crystallizes metaphor, emotion, and memory mechanics in 7 words. Final line’s "corridor" avoids muddle while charging closure with precise, earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms memory-trope via salt-crystallization mechanics: "pockets of gravity" as emotional weight feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes—memory as liquid light pools with "eddies dictated by gravity" avoids abstraction through visceral specificity.</comment>
