<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in Rowan's guilt/apology drive is embodied through tactile repair work; Elias's calloused grip conveys earned trust with visible cost. Minor deduction for slightly over-articulated reflection about Elias's crime.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost (Elias's wrist touch, fading heart mechanism) under Hybrid lens (causal repair + textural accumulation). Light-through-storm-clouds motif pays off organically in prison yard wash.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Music box repair shop constrains choice (gears as apology medium); clockwork heart charges final image. Cedar/brass sensory details filter through Rowan's penitential lens, evolving from confession-tick to chapel lullaby.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (apology as action vs. wind) tightens through Rowan's gear alignment; cost crystallizes in Elias's physical reach. Escalation driven by agency (winding heart) under Hybrid lens with prison-yard cleansing as felt consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through clockwork heart's dual meaning (time-gift/refusal) without moralizing. Final image reweights "narrow crack" metaphor as forgiveness mechanism, avoiding thematic echo despite Vale's quoted wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (Rowan's confessional lens, Vale's storm-slate eyes); rhythmic control in "tick/tock" cadence. Slight deduction for uniform "vibrant hush" repetition during high-pressure chapel scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; high density ("hairspring caught dusty light like spider silk"). Minor artifact penalty for three "vibrant hush" repetitions in final third dulling closure immediacy (-0.3).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms prison chaplain trope through clockwork heart's tangible stakes; "second opinions" reframes redemption as mechanical repair. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
