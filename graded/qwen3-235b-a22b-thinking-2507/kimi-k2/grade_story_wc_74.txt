<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "methodically hopeful" exhaustion vs creative urgency; embodied micro-choices (resisting sleep to witness proof) earn closure. Minor credibility dip in 71-hour insomnia not tested under pressure until climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost: brush crumbling into "silver dust" crystallizes ephemeral kindness-sparking. Accumulative lens holds via moonlight density shift, though janitor's backstory slightly disrupts pressure coherence at zenith.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Saffron pigment functions as micro-setting that charges closure (leaves wearing pigment) and constrains choices (painting medium). "Tomato plants" anchor specificity while "33 degrees" demonstrates professional precision driving the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mira's agency: each glyph stroke deepens the saffron hush, narrowing options toward proof. Visible cost in brush disintegration, though "methodically hopeful" trait lacks mid-beat testing until janitor's testimony.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (marigold memory, half-sandwich) without moralizing. Final image ("every leaf wore...") reweights "strangers remember kindness" as organic continuation, avoiding thematic echo despite pigeon's "We remember".</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("city like charcoal sketch someone tried to erase") shows character-particular noticing. Lyrical compression taught early ("saffron quiet") pays off in closure; zero register drift despite multiple characters' arrival.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "pooling like liquid mercury" multi-jobs atmosphere/propulsion. Final fragmented line ("every leaf wore") is intentional pattern-teaching. Figurative language enhances rather than obscures pressure in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms magical realism via specific constraints: brush's 33° moonlight angle and saffron's evolution from "quiet" to "hush". Risk-taking with abrupt closure heightens emotional truth without gimmickry, avoiding derivative "magical fixer" tropes.</comment>
