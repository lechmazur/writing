<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (brittle fragility vs. choosing to climb memory-rope) earn her descent; embodied cost in "knees buckled" and "cracked ice" avoids epiphany clichés; flaw-driven choice feels inevitable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: "Instead of falling, she descended" crystallizes isolation→motion with undeniable cost; Accumulative lens holds via humming density escalation; "mirror-scales flung starlight" legibly reconfigures stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tidal library shelves transform from "tombs" to "doorways" under her changed stance; brass sundial's atomic reflectivity constrains every choice, culminating in mirror-cloak charging the final descent image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through stone circle's humming density (not causal turns); isolation→independence trade-off crystallizes with visible cost in abandoned library permanence; pressure grows via sensory cadence shifts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment>Final image of mirror-scales "sketching paths" offers resonant non-literal answer to "translate isolation"; avoids moralizing via concrete action; "echo of what is gone / mouth that teaches echo" reframes theme without stating it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature: "tasted of ozone," "hum... copper and rain" filters reality through archivist's sensory lexicon; rhythmic control shifts from fractured ("cracked ice") to flowing ("gently as a feather") under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; "spilled salt," "warm snow" avoid cliché through precise POV texture; one borderline "tasted like copper" risks familiarity but saved by stone circle's unique function; propulsion never stalls.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "reincarnation" into tactile "brittle joints" and "ozone taste"; tidal library as living archive avoids trope via "spines breathing with tide"; risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscurity.</comment>
