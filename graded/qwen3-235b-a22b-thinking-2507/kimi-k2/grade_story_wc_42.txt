<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses (fixing vs. surrendering) through concrete choices like calibrating breath to the spinning hand, but "bright and hollow ache" leans toward abstraction. Final renunciation of repair mission earns transformation via the empty film canister's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "film canister empty, transparent" makes conceptual cost undeniable under Accumulative lens. Tremors-to-silence escalation reweights stakes through patterned density, not causality. Orientation clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lunar observatory functions as micro-setting: Earthlight-warmed dome constrains her choice to tilt the lens toward void, while dust "like inverted snow" charges the final spirals. Tools (spinning hand, film gate) directly shape tactics and closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single stake—whether to stop the spinning hand—deepens through Elara's agency: matching breath to its rhythm then restructuring the mount. Cost crystallizes in the empty film canister, making surrender tangible under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "escape velocity" transforms from physics to emotional surrender via the adjusted focal length. Final image of fractured moons in the motionless hand reweights impermanence without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "clock hand... compass stripped of north" reflects her technician’s eye. Rhythm modulates with tension—short clauses during tremors, flowing cadence at closure. Zero POV leakage despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "dust drifted from the rafters like inverted snow" layers atmosphere and motion. Minor scaffold in "luminous ache" repetition (paragraphs 3 and 8) slightly dulls closure’s novelty, but no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms repair trope through photographic lens: spinning hand as "miniature rocket" feels inevitable. Emotional specificity ("boy on Earth whose portrait she never finished") grounds cosmic stakes, resisting abstraction with lunar dust and brass casings.</comment>
