<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown via curator's sensory gift vs. emotional labor; micro-choices like kneeling to listen reveal values. Final choice earned through prior causality but internal conflict slightly underdeveloped in high-pressure moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density (mailbox vibration → whisper → letters) tightens stakes with visible cost (tears cutting dust paths). Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options with undeniable pressure; orientation anchored in first 50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Courtyard functions as micro-setting: rosemary guides Mira's path, welded mailbox constrains choices, final locket-hanging charges the image. Environment actively shapes tactics and closure without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mira's agency (neighborhood storytelling) under Accumulative lens; curfew siren tightens temporal pressure. Cost legible in neighbors' tears but secondary stake (personal safety vs. truth) lacks deeper friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (desert glass locket, "cancerous silences"), not abstraction. Final line reweights "listening" as active healing without moralizing, though "heal what force alone cannot" slightly edges toward stated philosophy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "scent sharp enough to cut through dust," syntax compresses under stress ("pulse steady in sandstorm calm"). Zero head-hopping; rhythm modulates from lyrical dawn to urgent climax with patterned diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "solder cracked like dry earth" demonstrates high density without muddle. Final line's em-dashes serve voice, and every sentence advances plot/emotion. Peak beats avoid figurative clutter while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of curator's sensory gift with cultural specificity (desert glass, Arabic names). Emotional truth in "tears cutting clean paths" avoids sentimentality, though "cancerous silences" risks diagnostic phrasing without full transformation.</comment>
