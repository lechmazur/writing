<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (skeptic/luminous) manifests in micro-choices like tasting air for "possibilities instead of proof," but Mara’s exposition risks over-articulation in "every sorrow seeds a squall" line, slightly diluting earned stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: ring dissolving into veins while stars become "ordinary" reconfigures the aurora’s meaning with visible cost ("weather no longer mine alone"), under a consistent Accumulative/Textural lens where sensory density tightens toward equilibrium.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tin ring functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—its dissolution into Mara’s veins literalizes merged climates—while lavender bluff pressure shapes tactics (cliff-edge convergence), meeting the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency (tasting air, pressing ring to wrist) under Accumulative lens; forest election’s "hush of leaves" forces convergence trade-off, but Mara’s grief-flood risk lacks deeper tactical cost beyond ring dissolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—dissolving ring, merged climates—not abstraction; final image ("two climates merged into one tolerable season") resonates as non-literal answer to emotional weather without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tasting wind for answers," flavor shifts) modulates under pressure, but "luminous skeptic" label slightly abstracts early interiority before embodiment; lyric compression taught via aurora ballots pays off cleanly in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold with high density ("ozone and cardamom" for tension), but "terrestrially cosmic" risks overwriting in a high-pressure beat; final line’s "spun toward next person" maintains propulsion without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotional weather as tangible stakes (forest elections, taste-based sensing) avoids tropes; risk-taking (lyric structure, Accumulative lens) heightens coherence, with "private auroras" concept feeling inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
