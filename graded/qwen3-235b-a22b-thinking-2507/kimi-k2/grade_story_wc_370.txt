<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("compassion meant never turning away" vs "turning inward") drives the earned renunciation; embodied empathy in "hush was not silence but listening" avoids therapy-speak. Minor slip: younger Elara's motivation lacks concrete friction before the mirror reveal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("nested paradoxes beating gently against her ribs"); Accumulative lens holds through patterned escalation. Deduction: Postal error resolution edges toward coincidence despite thematic justification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting (crumpled invitation) charges closure: transforms from misdelivered clue to "map of streets that did not yet exist," constraining Elara's final choice. Sensory specificity ("brass doorplate," "candles burned downward") avoids white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Elara's agency ("enacted the rite of staying while leaving"), narrowing options to crystallize stance. Cost legibility weakened: "regrets lifted" lacks visceral tradeoff; conceptual cost ("to err is to arrive") slightly overpowers felt consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "wound and remedy share the same heartbeat" motif reweighted in final image; avoids moralizing via "blank paper... ready to absorb whatever tomorrow." Non-literal answer in "nested paradoxes beating gently against her ribs" achieves conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("city’s pulse slow beneath her fingertips") sustains under pressure; rhythmic control in "pages turned themselves, rustling like patient wings." Minor register drift in "conceptual cost" near closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "candles hissed, shortening by the syllable" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Hairline slip: "enlarged tranquility swelled" slightly over-ornamented in high-pressure beat, risking clarity without penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "secret library" trope through paradox logic; emotional specificity in "smiling too widely, giving away pieces she could not spare" avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (time paradoxes) heightens stakes without gimmickry, but premise echoes Borges slightly.</comment>
