<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority excels with "heart heavier than marble" and bone-dust "slow applause," but contradictory impulses lack simultaneous tension in climax; micro-choices under pressure are strong yet flaw resolution feels too seamless for Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully—"time learns to circle" reweights the premise with visceral cost (soil replacing ache)—under a consistent Accumulative/Textural lens; the map revelation crystallizes stakes without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (excavation mechanics) and charges closure (indistinguishable bones/roots); "iron vines twisted into letters" exemplifies tactile specificity that shapes her reverence and final soil collection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through her labor, but escalation lacks visible pressure escalation—gravedigger’s refusal introduces secondary tension yet the "seven days" timeframe doesn’t tighten tactics; cost is felt (emotional shift) but not mechanistically driven by protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "serpent swallowing tail" to "time circles home," avoiding moralizing; the pomegranate seed finale reweights diaspora through concrete action, though "faith was not a monument" flirts with thematic echo but is saved by earned context.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bone dust like slow applause") and rhythmic control shine, but "cautious enchantment" repetition creates subtle scaffold; voice modulates perfectly from dawn’s hush to seventh-day revelation without POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or overwriting—"damp earth pressing through soles" shows textural propulsion—but "intimate patience" slightly drifts into abstraction; every line advances atmosphere or character, with closure image ("pocket-sized dawn") crystallizing momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms diaspora tropes via catacomb orchard’s bone-root symbiosis; "portable orchard of reconciled histories" synthesizes emotional specificity with structural risk, though the "warmly curious" trait lacks fresh inflection to hit 9.5+.</comment>
