<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lira’s memory-weaving versus self-erasure, but the redesign choice lacks sufficient struggle—her transition from questioning to action feels slightly abrupt despite strong embodied ache ("threads of paint that dripped").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("ache in her chest brightened"), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density escalation in the weaving sequence, though the "walls closing in" pressure isn’t fully leveraged until late.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse’s physical decay (salt-stained walls, rotted stairs) actively constrains Lira’s choices and charges the final image—her descent through absent stairs reconfigures the setting’s meaning, elevating specificity beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes (memory’s ownership vs oblivion) tighten meaningfully when Lira weaves threads into a new pattern, but the "walls closing in" pressure remains atmospheric rather than a live clock that alters her tactics incrementally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tarot’s fragmentation and reassembly, culminating in the resonant final image of "drowned portraits opening eyes"—a non-literal answer to "why fear the fall?" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust drifted like pale plankton," "luminescent ache") and rhythmic control deepen under pressure; elision of backstory is taught early and pays off in the keeper’s skeletal reveal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "dust drifted" repetitions and a near-duplicate metaphor ("shimmered, as though every drowned portrait had opened its eyes") slightly dull propulsion, but density remains high with zero figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms the lighthouse trope through the "luminescent ache" lens and tarot’s physical reassembly; risk-taking (memory-weaving as salvation) heightens stakes coherently without gimmickry, though the descent motif echoes common tropes.</comment>
