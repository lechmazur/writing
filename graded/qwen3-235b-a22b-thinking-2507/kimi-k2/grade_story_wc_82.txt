<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-choices in folding reveal hierarchy of values; grief transformed through craft avoids epiphany clichés. Contradictory impulses (precision vs. sorrow) act simultaneously during basilica's rotation. No diagnostic labels; embodied emotion in "satchel of grief heavier than any lantern" grounds loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with unmistakable cost in "weight... lessen" shift. Accumulative lens holds through ritual deepening: memory crystallization → folding → constellation scattering. Orientation clear by line 1; disorientation (inverse gravity) pays off in closure's meaning reweighting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Glass basilica constrains choices (folding during orientation flips) and charges final image (dimmed duty discharged). Recurring objects (moonstone, spider-silk paper) evolve causally: polished sphere cracks to release indigo mist. Sensory hierarchy reflects craftsperson's priorities—light refraction over scent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes signaled immediately via "satchel of grief heavier than any lantern"; escalation through ritual deepening narrows options to transformation. Cost unmistakable in meaning-shifted weight; agency drives every beat (polishing, folding, accepting sketch). One tightening suffices for Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: origami cranes scattering dreams as constellations. Final sketch reweights grief without moralizing—"transform grief was not to erase it but to give it wings." Avoids sentimentality via "violet flame" cranes and "luminous torment" specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature defined by light-crafting lexicon ("refracting starlight," "distilled dawn"). Rhythmic control under pressure: short clauses during memory flood ("child coughing petals of blue fire"). Compression taught early (plague ships) pays off in closure's hope sketch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances story ("levitating stones hummed" implies gravity constraint). Figurative language purposeful: "shadow peel away like burnt paper" clarifies basilica's function. Final lines ("already planning") propel without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes grief ritual with physics-defying setting: "descends while ascending" embodies emotional paradox. Fresh inflection in hospital ward sketch—transformed mourning into active hope. Avoids generic origami tropes via "violet flame" cranes and plague context.</comment>
