<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "volcanic tenderness trembling... like magma beneath thin crust" but "analytically intuitive" feels like diagnostic label-speak without embodied cost. Final renunciation earned through concrete art-making choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly when tapestry speaks: "Rescue is not waking me..." reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through volcanic density buildup to the glass key's exhale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Obsidian walls and mirrors actively constrain choices—painting over mirrors becomes necessary tactic. Final image charged by "volcanic tenderness now a steady glow," making setting indispensable to closure's reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize early: forgotten promise versus guilt. Agency drives escalation via painting choices that narrow options (e.g., final mirror rejecting pigment), with cost legible in "heartbeat... one throb per story" transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through "books... smelling faintly of fire forgiven"—resonant answer to "why stories matter" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by embedding wisdom in RETURN TO THE HEART stamp's action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "ash patterns of memory" but "analytically intuitive" disrupts voice with academic register. Rhythmic control under pressure strong, though minor psychic distance slip in curator's off-page presence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "volcanic tenderness trembling like magma" has slight scaffold but closure image ("warm to the touch") avoids sentimentality through concrete specificity. Zero loops in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms library trope via "heartbeat slowed to one throb per folktale" mechanic. Emotional truth in promise extending "between librarian and every future reader" creates fresh synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
