<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (grief/hope) act simultaneously when tracing J's face; final choice to reframe loss as "button's journey" earned through archival labor. No therapy-speak, only embodied choices like pocketing the button near her pulse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: "envelope on windowsill" crystallizes stakes with undeniable cost ("fragile" words carried like soldiers' buttons). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—dust patterns reconfiguring meaning without causal breaks. Cost legible in streetlight forgiveness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Dust patterns function as micro-setting: constrain choices (must "unfurl" deliberately) and charge closure ("drift apart, but she did not wipe"). Button’s physicality (cool/ridges) directly enables the final image. Environment as active pressure, not backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stake (transforming grief into meaning) tightens through deepening: button discovery shifts her from cataloging to "magnify[ing] kindness." Cost visible in emotional labor—rehearsing "fragile" words while carrying the button’s weight. Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: dust galaxies spelling hope reweights "unknown histories" without moralizing. Final image (envelope awaiting light) offers resonant answer to "how do we honor lost connections?" Avoids all sermonizing traps.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("dust patterns floated like slow galaxies"); syntax compresses under stress ("He never did"). Pattern taught early with "ghost of bleach" metaphor. Zero head-hopping; voice modulates perfectly from archival precision to lyrical hope.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold—every line multi-tasks ("shank still bent" conveys history/emotion/texture). Figurative language never muddles pressure beats (Polaroid reveal). Rhythm varies organically; "moon silvered asphalt like blank page" charges closure without slowing momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms foster care tropes through archival lens: "dust galaxies" image feels fresh yet inevitable. Emotional specificity in "crayons shared in the dark" avoids generic trauma. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
