<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied contradiction (serious playfulness vs. gravity defiance), but flaw-driven mistakes are underdeveloped; Liora’s competence lacks struggle that would deepen the "defiance" cost at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: "gravity of hopelessness lighten, ounce by ounce" crystallizes conceptual cost via "ballast dropped from a dream," with Accumulative/Textural lens (chant density → mosaic transformation) holding cohesively to the final "rules in the dust."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stone petals constrain choice (rag alignment), and "wet chalk" breeze directly enables mosaic lock mechanics; environment charges closure through "petals closing gently" while seeding "tiny suns" in stone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single deepening—knot on mosaic—narrows options by transforming hopelessness into actionable hope, with visible cost in "ballast dropped" imagery; agency-driven under Accumulative lens but secondary stake ("silence pockets") lacks friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through mosaic evolution ("Light remembers" → "Hope ascends") and "hesitant but present" stars, avoiding moralizing; final image reweights defiance as "inventing a new game" with conceptual cost (gravity "persuaded to dance").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("syllables shaped like pinwheels," "footprint of ember") with rhythmic control in climax; no POV slippage despite fortress "humming," as chant filter maintains focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; "colorless fire tracing rag’s pattern" demonstrates high-density propulsion. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" (implied but undramatized) prevents 9.5, though closure remains vivid.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "fireworks designer" trope through stone-petal physics and "serious playfulness" as tangible force; "Defiance" as child’s game synthesizes hope/gravity with risk that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
