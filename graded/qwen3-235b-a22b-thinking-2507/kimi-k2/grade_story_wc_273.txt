<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Alba's "serene anger" is concretely embodied through tracker instincts and albino immunity, driving her calm focus amid chaos. Final choice to step through the doorway earns closure via prior causality (her anger enabling observation), but internal contradiction lacks depth beyond anger/fear dichotomy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Conceptual Repricing: "time slows in crisis because we expand to fill it" reweights the premise with undeniable cost (researchers' "eternal terror" vs Alba's serenity). Accumulative lens holds through ink pattern escalation, though "mercy, not malice" edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Wind-carved encampment actively constrains choices when walls "shift, responding to the drone's signal" to reveal chambers. Ink functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—suspended researchers in "amber moments" crystallize time's cost through environmental transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten as ink patterns escalate to a doorway, driven by Alba's agency (syncing drone, following trails). Cost is visceral in "faces frozen in expressions of eternal terror," but pressure lacks a meaningful reversal beyond linear pattern accumulation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ink's behavior—time dilation as consciousness expansion—without moralizing. Ending reweights it via "mercy, not malice" insight, but phrasing slightly over-articulates the conceptual cost that should resonate through image alone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("pale feet leaving no prints," drone's "artificial eyes"), with rhythm modulating under pressure. Minor flaw: "serene anger" risks label repetition, and "cold fire" borders on bodily cliché without fresh embodiment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose maintains high density with clean propulsion, but "patterns that hurt to perceive directly" introduces vague abstraction. No major loops, though "ephemeral swirls/ephemeral patterns" risks subtle synonym churn in peak tension beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time dilation via ink as temporal medium, grounded in albino physiology as immunity device. Tropes transformed through specific stakes (consciousness acceleration), though "disappearing ink" premise echoes familiar sci-fi without radical reinvention.</comment>
