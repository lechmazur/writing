<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elias's reticence manifests in embodied choices (stacking stones silently, rolling glass against collarbone hollow) rather than stated traits; his contradictory impulses—believing in tides not ghosts yet responding to the widow—drive the earned endurance closure with palpable cost in "letting it settle like sediment."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: bottling the "luminescent ache" crystallizes the stakes' reweighting under the accumulative lens, where each letter and stone-stack deepens pressure without causal turns; the flask's "Return" etching makes the cost legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lantern room functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (widow's presence forces Elias to whisper his promise) and charges closure; the sea glass evolves from pocket object to lens cradle to bottled essence, its physical properties directly shaping the final image's resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens is driven by Elias's agency—shifting from passive stone-stacking to actively bottling the ache—with the cost crystallized in "the feeling of safety I had learned to distill," making the stakes viscerally felt through tangible action rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The final image of the capped flask reweights the entire narrative without moralizing; "I keep the light, and the light keeps me" emerges from concrete particulars (sea glass, stones) to offer a resonant answer to the central question of protection, avoiding thematic echo through earned subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tides, not ghosts") and rhythmic control persist under pressure; the widow's "phosphorescence" smile and Elias's whispered promise modulate syntax without breaking voice coherence, teaching the pattern early through salt/lilacs scent noting "every tremor in his hands."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "luminescent ache" repetition deepens meaning rather than parroting, and the final image ("corking it, etching 'Return'") achieves crystalline clarity without figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse tropes through specific emotional calculus (bottling safety as distillation from "salt, sorrow, and vigilance"); the synthesis of stone-stacking code and letter chain feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking heightening stakes via the widow's non-ghostly presence.</comment>
