<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "not to cage the moth but to understand why it fled," with embodied emotion through synchronized breathing. Flaw: "understood then that erasing boundaries wasn't destruction" risks diagnostic label-speak without sufficient embodied cost in the beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise via "the reading was zero," reconfiguring maker/dream as a single point with conceptual cost in the transformed orchard. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density increase in the breathing sequence that reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orchard's glass mountains constrain choice by chiming with breath to create the fog-mirror, charging the final image where they "breathe" as living grove. Sextant's brass transforms from broken tool to heart-warmed compass, essential to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (dreams vs. caging) deepen through protagonist's agency in synchronized breathing, narrowing options to recreation not capture. Cost is legible in "crack she hadn't noticed growing across her own heart," altering her craft forever.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the sextant's fracture transforming into "new measurements between souls," avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights boundaries as "a bridge" with conceptual cost in the erased distinction between maker and dream.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is crystalline: "crystalline leaves that had forgotten how to fall" reflects her craft-bound POV. Rhythmic control peaks in the breathing sequence where syntax mirrors inhale/exhale cadence without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "frost's shimmer" and "silver pages" achieve textural specificity without muddle. Slight density risk in "petrified into glass mountains that chimed" offset by momentum in the decisive "reading was zero" closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms "broken sextant" trope through astronomer's instrument becoming soul-measuring tool. Fresh synthesis: boundaries erased as "single point" reconfigures dream-capture premise with inevitable emotional logic in the orchard's transformation.</comment>
