<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's embodied claustrophobia and porcelain doll ritual reveal contradictory impulses (escape vs. duty) through micro-choices like limiting silence exposure. Father's late introduction slightly weakens relationship dynamics, though his silent tears show earned vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with gravity becoming "optional," reconfiguring the world with conceptual cost (floating tears as salt/forgiveness). Orientation test fails: gravity inversion rule emerges too late (para 2), costing 0.4 per rubric.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Xenial trellis and porcelain doll constrain choices (exposure limits, root clipping), charging the final archway image. But bunker corridors lack tactile specificity during descent; "dollhouse throat" feels abstract rather than embodied constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lira's agency: limiting exposure to preserve silence flavors directly forecloses options when gravity tugs. Cost is unmistakable in father's soundless weeping and Lira collecting tears as new silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: silence-tasting reframes trauma into resilience. Final image ("porcelain doll smiled... sky where no one ever had to hide") reweights prior material without moralizing, though "gilded hush" repetition borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("taste of tin and apology," "pulse slowed by wonder") modulates under pressure. Moonlight "leaked" not "shone" reveals character-specific bias. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during silence rituals.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "stretched contracted muscles" shows syntactic innovation without muddle. Minor density issue: "intangibly tangible" appears twice with near-identical phrasing, costing 0.1 in high-band scoring.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of claustrophobia/silence-tasting avoids bunker tropes. Risk-taking (gravity inversion as emotional metaphor) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Derivative premise guardrail avoided through porcelain doll's evolving role as emotional conduit.</comment>
