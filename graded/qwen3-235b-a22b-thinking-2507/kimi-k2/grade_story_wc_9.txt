<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "surrender could feel so much like flight" and the preemptive hand tracing—a ghost of future she might steal back. Final renunciation of "healing" time for acceptance (scarred saucer) is earned by scattered light thread's cost. No diagnostic labels; embodied emotion throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: "a scar that would remember the wound" crystallizes irreversible loss. Accumulative lens holds—density of images (crack, thread, hands) tightens pressure until stance crystallizes. Cost proven in "droplets of luminescence that fell back like reversed rain."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cracked saucer constrains every choice: alignment as compass, thread emergence, sealing as scar. Final image—saucer "whole enough to hold the future"—charges closure through prior object logic. Sensory details (glowing moss, iron-lavender repentance) serve urgency without checklist overuse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via deepening realization: time doesn’t "accumulate" but lives in "hollows shaped like the space between a mother’s arms." Agency is renunciation—unfastening regret spills ink that weaves the thread. Cost unmistakable in scattered light droplets forfeiting tangible connection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete objects: saucer’s crack as unhealable wound, overlapping hand prints as love filling absences. Final image rejects tidy morals—time isn’t "found" but carried home in scars and traces. No moralizing; "spaces we choose to fill with love" reweights loss as active choice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is crystalline: "starlight so thick it felt like drowning in silver" filters reality through guilt. Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure—short clauses during thread scattering ("she reached... fingers passed through it"). Zero head-hopping; voice stays anchored in cartomancer’s lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "reversed rain" and "choking beauty" avoid cliché through precise texture. Peak beats ("thread of light thickened, weaving itself into the cloth") show zero overwriting. Final line’s "overlapping like a promise" delivers propulsion without muddle—closure image immaculate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms time-loss trope via specific objects: blood-inked cards, traced hands. Emotional truth in "hollows shaped like the space between a mother’s arms" avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (accumulative structure) heightens stakes—closure hinges on acceptance, not recovery.</comment>
