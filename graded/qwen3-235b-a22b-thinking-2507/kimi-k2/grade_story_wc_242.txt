<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara’s "cultivated estrangement" philosophy versus her emergent connection with callers; embodied cost in the tremor when realizing the tunnel’s schematic has no exit. Final choice to dissolve earned by ledger’s blank "Begin" column.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: Mara dissolving into "the interval between two notes" reweights the premise. Accumulative lens holds—disc loop intensification narrows options, and "recursive act" sparks the final transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the glass harmonica disc constrains every key choice (spinning it to transform calls) and charges the closure as shards seed city sounds. Sensory details like "flickered between the hum" reflect Mara’s urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mara’s agency: disc loop intensifying forces her to apply her philosophy to herself. Dominant stake (transforming endings) tightens when she dials her own number, with visible cost in her dissolution. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the ledger’s "Begin" column and final rail melody—no moralizing. Lila’s "sunlight on her face" description resonates as earned wisdom, reweighting "endings" without abstraction. Closure’s "disguised origin" crystallizes the concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: technical ("cables older than the city’s first subway line") fused with lyrical ("voice melodically haunted"). Under stress, syntax compresses ("Mara closed the call, hung up"), avoiding ventriloquism. Voice modulates perfectly with pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("shards chiming like tiny bells" does triple duty). Final line recharges opening tunnel imagery. Minor deduction for one near-duplicate ("between the hum of streetlamps") in high-pressure beat, dulling closure’s immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "magical operator" trope via specific, irreplaceable mechanics: ledger’s blank column, recursive dialing. Emotional truth in how small acts transform both caller and operator. Risk-taking (dissolution as "interval between notes") heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
