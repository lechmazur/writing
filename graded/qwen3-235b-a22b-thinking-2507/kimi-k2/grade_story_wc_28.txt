<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices: velvet-lined soldier's coat and tracing the chipped leaf reveal the "gentle radical" without labels. Leylah's "grief like flint" creates authentic status dynamics. Slight over-intellectualization in retrocognition moment ("pupil of a tile gazelle") edges toward unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the plaza's "final frost plume" crystallizes options with palpable cost in "fire-forgiven hands." Accumulative lens holds perfectly—mosaic restoration deepens the mercy stake without causal breaks. Orientation is anchored by "ash smell" within 50 words, avoiding penalties.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains every choice: frost-rimmed colonnades force careful movement, glass shards dictate restoration tactics, and the "cracked sky" directly charges the final image. The tesserae function as micro-setting, with "powdered gold" insertion physically altering the plaza's rebirth. No generic descriptors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("aberrant mercy") tightens through Leylah's blood-tessera reveal, shifting from observation to active repair. Cost is visceral in "empire burns more than rage" and the emotional labor of "fire-forgiven hands." Agency drives escalation under accumulative lens—no coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through mosaic work: "rename itself before rebuilding" avoids moralizing while reweighting "mercy twisted askew." Final image ("sky ceasing its bleeding") offers resonant, non-literal answer to processing trauma. No thematic echo—Leylah's dialogue stays character-grounded.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "porcelain sky cracked like old glaze" filters setting through Azim's radical-poet lens. Rhythmic control excels in high-pressure beats ("history folded like wet parchment"). Minor slip: "retrocognitively trapped" slightly violates POV lexicon but is quickly grounded in sensory detail.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere or character ("soot fingerprints washed away by winter rain" implies emotional cleansing). Figurative language serves accumulative pressure without muddle. Final beat ("plaza exhaled a final frost plume") crystallizes with perfect propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms war-story tropes through mosaic metaphor: "shrapnel flowers" and "unconsumed bullets" ground emotional complexity. The "aberrant mercy" concept feels fresh, synthesized through specific details (surgeons amputating without anesthetic). Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
