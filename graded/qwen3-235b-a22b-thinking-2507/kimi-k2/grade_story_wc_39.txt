<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied micro-choices (capturing "his own sob he pretended was only salt in the wind") revealing contradictory impulses. Flaws like fragile self-deception deepen motivation without sentimentality. No second character, so relationship bullets irrelevant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "sand erasing footprints" charges conceptual cost of vanishing while "children building castles" hear the chorus. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—each jar capture intensifies density toward the "traveling translation" reconfiguration with undeniable felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting (music box ballerina frozen then turning) constrains the climax ritual. Dunes actively charge closure: shifting grains become "applause," then erase footprints to embody transience. Every sensory detail (e.g., "wax the color of old piano keys") pressures the poet’s choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Accumulative escalation: capturing seven sounds builds density until the "captive auroras" moment. Cost crystallizes physically—"music box slowed, its spring unwinding like a life"—and conceptually as footprints vanish, reweighting the poet’s "gleaned redemption" with irrevocable loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: "children building castles" hearing "sweetness they cannot explain" answers the central question without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by making "I was here, I loved, I vanished" a sonic braiding, not abstract statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable—"tasting of iron and distance" for dawn’s whistle filters all observation. Rhythm modulates from fragmented urgency ("Glass rang, silver flashed") to flowing climax cadence. Zero head-hopping; voice remains anchored in the poet’s tactile world.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "hinge creak, rain on a caravan roof" avoids sensory checklist by serving pressure. Figurative language ("captive auroras") charges pivotal beats without muddle. Minor slip: "positively wistful" slightly abstracts but saved by immediate concrete context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "sound preservation" trope through glass jars' physicality—redemption as subtraction ("satchel now lighter"). Fresh angle: legacy lives in children’s unexplained pause, not direct inheritance. Avoids sentimentality via the dunes’ "exhaling grains" as both erasure and carrier.</comment>
