<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (control vs. surrender) drives micro-choices like stitching the lullaby then cutting sinew; embodied cost of entrapment in final weave earns closure. Slight early motivation opacity slightly delays full contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("stitching herself into its cortex," "weaving endlessly") under Accumulative lens; density escalation (writhing threads, liquefying glass) reweights stake without causal breaks. Orientation clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Optical illusion gallery functions as micro-setting constraining choices (Möbius corridor requiring childhood patterns, mirrors forcing self-confrontation); sinew thread charges final image as "indistinguishable from her own nerves," fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mara's agency (weaving net, cutting sinew) under Accumulative lens; "memories altered faster" deepens pressure, making entrapment cost unmistakable. Dominant stake (mapping vs. consumption) tightens via one decisive intensification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of connection-as-surrender emerges non-literally through final image ("surrender woven into control, a knot that could never be untied"); avoids moralizing while reweighting "texture" with conceptual cost of eternal weaving.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("realistically imaginary," "rational enchantment") creates distinct rhythm; syntactic compression during crisis ("She cut the sinew with her teeth, tasting iron and salt") modulates voice without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops but "blood evaporated into equations" slightly muddles peak-beat clarity; otherwise high density ("thread tugged, anchoring her to a moment") propels with concrete verbs. No closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synthesizes dream architecture with optical physics into fresh emotional calculus; "rational enchantment" trope transformed through specific sinew mechanics and earned entrapment. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
