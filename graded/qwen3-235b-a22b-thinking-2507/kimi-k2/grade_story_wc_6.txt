<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses (fear/duty, pain/compassion) act simultaneously in scene; final coin gift earns closure through prior causality with visible cost ("unstrung the red thread"). No diagnostic label-speak—scar imagery embodies emotion. Strength: "old burns harmonize with wind" shows internal conflict through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: Mara's relinquishment of the coin (her "compass") crystallizes the shift from self-protection to generative compassion. Accumulative lens holds—the lagoon's acceptance of singing birds reconfigures pain's meaning. Cost proof: "warm as a heartbeat" thread unstrung charges final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Black sand constrains choices (kneeling, shaping birds) and charges closure—the lagoon "accepts" the sand bird, transforming trauma into song. Obsidian water isn't backdrop but active constraint: "spun slowly, releasing a melody." Micro-setting (sand as "second skin of cooled lava") directly shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mara's agency under Accumulative lens: boy's appearance at father's burnt stake forces stance crystallization. Dominant stake (can pain birth compassion?) tightens when she gives the coin, paying visible cost ("warm as a heartbeat" thread unstrung). Cost is unmistakable in the closure beat—no coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "even lava learns to be soil" avoids moralizing by showing transformation via sand birds. Final image ("bird circled once... sang a note so pure") offers resonant non-literal answer to "scars can sing" without stating a moral. No thematic echo—wisdom arises from particulars like ash-blessed faces.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("clouds like drifting kelp," "pulse match thunder") with rhythmic control under pressure—short syntax for child's cry ("thin as gull wings"), lyrical flow for closure. Elision (lightning scent evoking past fires) taught early and paid off. Zero head-hopping; voice modulates perfectly from "kelp-drift peace" to scar-song clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where every line charges momentum ("each grain carried flecks of obsidian, tiny mirrors..."). Final beat ("a note so pure") cuts precisely without muddle. Sentence rhythm varies naturally—longer clauses for reflection, staccato for action ("Mara rose gracefully alert"). No figurative overwriting in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: firefighter daughter of arsonist transforms volcanic trauma into singing birds. Avoids cliché through specific details (obsidian lagoon, red-thread coin) and emotional truth in "scars can sing." Risk-taking heightens stakes—the quiet closure reconfigures pain without resolution, feeling inevitable through prior particulars like ash-blessed faces.</comment>
