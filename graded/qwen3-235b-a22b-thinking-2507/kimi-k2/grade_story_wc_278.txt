<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("carry heavens outward" vs. haunted by cry) manifests in micro-choices like tattooing throat with meteorite ink; embodied grief avoids labels through physical sync of wingbeat/cry; final endurance (carrying freckle-sized guilt) earns closure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: pressing tattooed throat to console seals the cry with felt cost ("guilt shrink to freckle"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases toward "meteor hush" reconfiguration; orientation clear by line 3 with vaulted chamber/phonographs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting (amber's trapped vibration) directly constrains climax choice; laboratory's physical rules ("footstep erased itself") enable resolution; final image of insect wingbeat as "distant lullaby" charges closure by transforming setting's core function.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: cry's return forces tattooing throat, narrowing options to binding sound in amber; escalation peaks when firmware offers tether, with irrevocable cost ("guilt shrink to freckle") legible on final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: mapping cry to wingbeat reconfigures grief as rhythm rather than scream; final "freckle" image answers central question without moralizing, reweighting "carrying heavens" with earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct (sound as physical object: "phonographs hung like bats"); rhythmic control under pressure peaks in tattooing sequence ("each prick syncing"); compression taught early ("time folded") pays off in hospital transition without disorientation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ink mixed with powdered meteorite" exemplifies triple-duty density; no figurative muddle in climax beat; final line's "distant, harmless lullaby" crystallizes tonal shift with surgical precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief mechanics: guilt as physical vibration mapped via tattooing; emotional specificity in "freckle-sized" resolution avoids abstraction; risk-taking (amber as sound storage) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
