<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Lira chooses violet path (prism sight vs. urgency) and kneels despite ejection risk, but "prism-minded" trait remains observational rather than driving decisions; micro-choices reveal hierarchy via mercury-seed planting under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("knees stinging," gravity snapping upright"), but mercury pool resolution slightly softens stakes; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density buildup to final image where seeds root in her pulse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Serpentine grotto actively constrains choice: slick basalt causes initial lift, sideways gravity forces rune-walking, mercury pool resists inversion; final mist tasting "of rain and iron" charges closure with environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering vigilance seeds) tightens as gravity "remembers its duty," narrowing options to one reentry; cost is legible in physical strain and time pressure, though threshold ejection threat resolves slightly too neatly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: seeds as "crystallized intentions" crystallize in mercury reflection, and final walk toward a child's lie reweights vigilance without moralizing; avoids thematic echo through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "prism-minded sight fracturing gloom," but "clandestinely luminous" repetition borders on template cadence; rhythmic control excels in inversion climax ("Gravity snapped upright; Lira fell...").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor synonym churn in "latent blaze smoldering beneath ordinary daylight" → "latent blaze inside her chest"; high density otherwise, though "manuscript margin doodle" descriptor loops without compression.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms vigilance into physical seeds reflecting "betrayals that never happened"; gravity inversion mechanic serves theme perfectly without gimmickry; emotional specificity in "child's first lie" avoids abstraction.</comment>
