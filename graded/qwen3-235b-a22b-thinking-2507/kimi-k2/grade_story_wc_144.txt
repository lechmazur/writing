<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation (rescuing expedition as redemption for daughter’s loss) is embodied through micro-choices like warming resin in palms; "counting motor stutters like a mother counts breaths" shows contradictory impulses without diagnostic labels. Blindness shapes every action, avoiding stock blindness tropes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: ripples carrying "secret code" across her palms crystallizes cost of isolation and purpose. Causal chain holds tight (anchor lift → deadline → water method → launch), with condensation-wiping showing visceral emotional toll after success.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Water basin constrains every choice—Mara’s blindness forces its use for refraction, and it evolves from tool to final image where ripples "carry faint reflected light across her palms." Mist shifts from barrier to "lantern," charging the closure with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Escalation is causal tightening at its finest: Orion’s whistle sounds → fingers fly → final flap sealed. Cost is undeniable in "condensation from her bench" after success, showing emotional exhaustion. Agency pure—no coincidence, only her skill against time.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "every patch was a promise kept" and lullaby humming; final line "glowed softly, a lantern for anything lost" reweights mist without moralizing. Avoids false balance—Mara’s grief isn’t "redeemed" but integrated into purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful: light as "warmth on cheeks," fractures as "glassy sighs." Under stress, sentences shorten to "Mara’s fingers flew now." Zero head-hopping; even chain clanks filtered through her hearing. Only minor tense slip ("alloy chest vibrate").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops—every sentence does triple duty: "rain collected, a water feature she had built... to read light" establishes setting, character, and method in 12 words. Figurative language sparse but potent ("shattered rainbow"); final line’s rhythm creates visual cadence without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms "repair" trope through blindness-as-asset; water basin method feels fresh yet inevitable. Emotional truth in "counting micro-stutters like a mother counts breaths" avoids sentimentality. No derivative elements—hummingbird drone serves causality via wing refraction.</comment>
