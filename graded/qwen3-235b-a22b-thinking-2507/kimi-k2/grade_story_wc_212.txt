<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in breath control versus membrane fragility; micro-choices (ungloving finger, sealing spiral) reveal value hierarchy with embodied cost ("membrane thinned, threatening to tear"). Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise via "first line of a letter" with undeniable conceptual cost (inheritance as permission not property). Orientation anchored by word 12; Accumulative lens holds through density escalation to "hush of wheat fields" realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Icebound atrium actively constrains choices (cold retreats on balustrade, seeds quiver from alignment). Micro-setting (acorn cap as starlight cradle) charges final image where "borrowed time" keeps rhythm with her heart. Zero generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensory pressure (seeds aligning, ice retreating) culminating in membrane tear threat. Agency-driven escalation via breath control narrows options to sealing/spiraling. Cost ("membrane thinned") feels visceral but slightly abstract in wording.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>"Inheritance is not property but permission" emerges organically from vortex touch, avoiding moralizing. Final seed-gathering recharges "stacking years into a ladder" with earned resonance. No thematic echo; complexity lingers in "letter to the spiral."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "breath crystallizing into tiny constellations" and "glaciers deciding to forgive the sea." Rhythmic control mirrors ritual slowness; "furiously tranquil" slightly abstract for peak stress but redeemed by "hush of wheat fields" immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "reverse avalanche returning to the peak" shows density without muddle. "Stacking years into a ladder" exemplifies textural specificity. One minor register drift ("conceptual cost") in final paragraph barely dents perfection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms seed-saving trope through vortex inheritance mechanics. "Borrowed time" concept feels fresh via tactile details (ungloved finger, acorn shells scent). Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry; "letter to the spiral" reconfiguration inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
