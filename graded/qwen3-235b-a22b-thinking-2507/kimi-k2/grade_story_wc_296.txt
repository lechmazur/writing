<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in embodied choices (palms to thorns), but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses during seed planting; micro-choice of confession feeding the plant earns stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly with visible cost ("throat filled with taste of unspoken truth"), though conjurer's physical return slightly strains Accumulative lens coherence at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ice and seed function as micro-setting that constrains choices (thinnest ice at vortex center) and charges final bridge image; sensory details reflect urgency without checklist overreach.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</comment><comment>Stakes tighten through seed's progression, but conjurer's return resolves conflict via near-coincidence rather than pure protagonist agency under Accumulative lens; cost legible in thorn wounds.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (mirrors refusing reflection), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "unguarded heart" without stating thesis, though "warlike serenity" risks abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frost-numbed fingers," "iron and apples" scent) with rhythmic control; compression taught early through vortex imagery pays off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density, but "serene yet bristling, as if orchard drew a sword" risks mixed metaphor; propulsion maintained through varied syntax during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "flesh-eating plant" trope with emotional confession creates inevitability; bold risk in physicalizing lies as devoured seeds heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
