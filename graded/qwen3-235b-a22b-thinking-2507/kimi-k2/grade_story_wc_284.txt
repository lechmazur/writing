<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("prudently daring" yet stepping onto frozen lake) and embodied emotion ("heartbeat sounded like distant drum wrapped in wool") drive credible micro-choices; Mara's arrival earns closure through prior causality of pillbox halves and snow codes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost: snapped pillbox echoes as "starting gun" while mist lifts to reveal "green shoots piercing snow"—reconfiguration of fracture-as-map earned by causal snow-code decoding and descent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zephyr Bluff’s mist constrains choice (muffled footfalls forcing tactile snow decoding) and charges final image ("silvered by mist" hair → "first true zephyr"); micro-setting (pillbox, violet) directly alters tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (trust repair) tighten via protagonist’s agency: decoding snow patterns forces descent into unknown; cost legible in "unused courage" shift from "slow ember" to active warmth, though Mara’s arrival slightly softens pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "tracing the scar until it became a map" crystallizes in final image of whole pillbox guiding them, avoiding moralizing while reweighting "fixing what’s broken" via green shoots piercing snow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("gulls wheeled like torn paper," "pewter" light) modulates with pressure; lyric compression taught early pays off in closure’s "zephyr" resonance without head-hopping or POV drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sap sticky against his glove" and "meltwater exposed darker earth" demonstrate textural specificity; snow-code mechanics avoid figurative muddle while advancing plot in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms spy genre through emotional specificity: "prudently daring" trait shapes ice-testing behavior and match-striking, avoiding tropes via pillbox-as-map metaphor; fresh synthesis of fracture/courage feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
