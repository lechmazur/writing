<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara's "affectionate skeptic" contradiction manifests concretely through micro-choices like grinding pills while checking locks. Somatic markers (mother's hands, swallowed laughter) embody internal conflict without diagnostic labels. Child confrontation crystallizes the tension between skepticism and tenderness as active choices, not alternating summaries. Final renunciation of scarcity mindset earns cost through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when Mara understands the recall was about scarcity, not safety—the conceptual cost visible in the lingering "warmth behind my knees" compass. Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: sensory density (capillaries pulsing, mirrored water) reweights the stake without causal turns. The "willowglass" constraint subtly shapes tactics but could tighten the final image further for 9.5+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Light painting studio functions as micro-setting: fiber-optic vines project pathways, muscovite geode constrains choices, and mirrored water charges the final image. Every detail serves urgency—crisis narrows perception to "warmth behind knees," calmer moments admit "willowglass hope." Recurring geode sliver (from razor-thin shard to pocket ticket) reweights closure through embodied constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stake ("illuminate hidden pathways") tightens through Mara’s agency: painting seams narrows options to the mirrored corridor. Escalation driven by somatic markers (knee warmth → rib hiccup) deepens knowledge with visceral cost. Child confrontation crystallizes the moral calculus between curiosity and scarcity, though the transition’s ease slightly softens pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "willowglass hope"—flexible yet unbreakable—reweighting the pill’s purpose as communal access, not safety. Final image (brush behind ear, humming mother’s tune) answers the scarcity question without moralizing. Sigil "open eye inside a heart" crystallizes earned wisdom through concrete action, avoiding thematic echo via embodied stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "razor-thin" muscovite, "hiccup of laughter," and "willowglass soft" heartbeat filter reality through Mara’s scientific-poetic lens. Rhythmic control under pressure ("static shock came at 3:17 a.m.") modulates with urgency. No head-hopping; child’s silent dialogue carries subtext through water ripples.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fractally precise spiral" and "branching futures" deepen density without muddle. Final line ("bending but never breaking") propels closure with crystalline rhythm. Slight density in "capillaries pulsing like a thought trying to speak" risks overwriting but pays off via motif integration. Opening/ending anchor voice flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transcends telepathy tropes via somatic markers and "willowglass hope"—specific, verifiable details that synthesize scientific and mystical. Bold risk in mirrored water corridor transforms child confrontation into earned revelation, not nostalgia. Emotional truth in "stubborn tenderness I kept calling skepticism" avoids generic templates with organic freshness.</comment>
