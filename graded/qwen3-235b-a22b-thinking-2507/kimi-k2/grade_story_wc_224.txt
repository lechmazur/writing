<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied details ("mercury skin reflecting futures," "wept mercury tears") and contradictory impulses (remembering as painful yet necessary). Final choice to speak the language is earned by grandmother's lessons and stone's memory-seeding, with visible cost: resurrecting forgotten people. Slight underdevelopment of grandmother relationship prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: sensory density intensifies toward Charged Poise closure where speaking "breaking ice" word reconfigures labyrinth into home. Cost is unmistakable—"each word resurrects someone forgotten"—and legible in the stone's consequence. Orientation anchors within 40 words; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mountain-bookstore functions as active micro-setting: breathing corridors shift with heartbeat maps, crystallized ink drips constrain movement. The lost language stone's evolution—from pocket warmth to second heart—directly charges the final image of mercury skin reflecting "true shape." Every detail filters through seer's sensory bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: stone's warming pulse drives her deeper despite knowing words resurrect the forgotten. Escalation culminates in the agonizing choice to speak anyway, with undeniable conceptual cost ("world chose to forget"). Single tightening suffices; cost resonates through every rebuilt room.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "home wasn't a place but a language" crystallizes after rooms rebuild via syllables. Final image of stones remembering "grandmother's garden" offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Complexity shines in portraying resurrection as both burden and homecoming.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mercury skin reflected not what was, but what might be") modulates under pressure—syntax compresses during high-stakes speaking. Purposeful elision (no second character) taught early; rhythm varies from lyrical ("ammonite fossils") to staccato ("She sat. Placed the stone.") without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels narrative ("stalactites of crystallized ink dripped onto tables grown from stone"). Figurative language ("raven's plume black as space between stars") remains precise in peak beats. Final line ("hidden thunder now her heartbeat's rhythm") recharges motif with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specific synthesis: mercury-glass body isn't decorative but enables reflecting "true shape" post-revelation. Risk-taking (lyric structure over causal plot) heightens emotional stakes—the mountain's architecture of belonging feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Fresh inflection in language as resurrection tool.</comment>
