<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied through action ("kneeling to listen to footsteps" while "opening chest to darkness"), no diagnostic labels. Final renunciation of sweeping earned by vulnerability climax with visible cost in pulse-scars.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("strength was not in resisting the void but in admitting how thoroughly it had already entered him"). Accumulative lens holds via sensory density escalation; disorientation functional for closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Station actively constrains choices (brooms useless because "dust was memory"), lantern glass charges final image as beating heart. Micro-setting (floorboards, gears) directly shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stake (silence vs connection) tightens through janitor's vulnerability deepening; meteors veering toward station after chest-opening shows agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens with visceral cost (light scars in bloodstream).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (tracing stars leaves scars) not statement. Final constellation "shaped like an open hand" offers resonant non-literal answer to cosmic loneliness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("roots curious about stone") with rhythmic control; high-pressure beats compress syntax ("He set the glass... and waited") without voice drift. Patterned elision taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; only deduction for borderline density in "pulse flickered like a broken beacon" during high-pressure beat. Final image ("constellation shaped like an open hand") crystal-clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms janitor trope through cosmic specificity; vulnerability as "doorway" shown via physical light scars. Risk-taking (Accumulative lens) heightens stakes without gimmickry, commitment to premise undeniable.</comment>
