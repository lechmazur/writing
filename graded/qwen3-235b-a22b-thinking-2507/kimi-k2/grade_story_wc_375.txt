<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her flight from art versus the cave's pull; embodied tears and lock-repair micro-choices earn the endurance arc. Slight over-tidiness in the epiphany edges down perfection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: tears salt her lips while the lock’s repair forecloses escape. Accumulative lens holds as memories click like tumblers—pressure deepens through sensory density, not causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystal cave constrains every choice: quartz hum guides her hands, pigment scraped from veins becomes the final paint. Micro-setting (lock/vial) charges the locket-image closure—environment as active crucible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through protagonist agency: memories-as-combination deepen the dominant conflict (truth vs. survival). Cost is unmistakable when gold pigment hardens into "living filament"—a felt reconfiguration of identity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulates: berry-stained grin fading as "auroral sorrow" blooms on walls. Final image—walking toward surface carrying dawn—resonates without moralizing, reweighting "inescapable calling" as self-reclamation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp ("charcoal whispers," "dawn-colored sorrow"). Rhythmic control under pressure: sentence fragments ("Indigo, apricot, bruise") mirror fractured memory without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; every line propels: "cradles it like a bird with snapped wings" does triple duty (emotion/object/foreshadowing). Closure beat ("molten and merciful") avoids figurative muddle with crystalline precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms art-recovery tropes via specific, verifiable detail: marigold-distilled pigment, lock-tumblers as memory anchors. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without obscuring the earned dawn-walk closure.</comment>
