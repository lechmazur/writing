<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mireille’s provisional belief in the scarf’s power ("cartographers believe dragons"), with embodied emotion in her creak-avoiding gait. Final choice to shelve the book earns endurance through tactile cost (scarf’s new weight), but secondary pressure from patrons remains atmospheric rather than driving choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: patrons’ sudden story-recognition and the scarf’s physical weight shift reconfigure the library’s reality. Accumulative lens holds as geometry bends through density of poetic images ("equations unfolded into narratives"), with Fibonacci flickers teaching the pattern early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The oxidized copper scarf constrains every choice—from guiding Mireille to the book to settling "against her pulse like a satisfied cat" at closure. Hyperbolic aisles and drool Möbius strip charge the final image, proving micro-setting necessity for 9+ band entry.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Mireille’s agency: her touch on the coordinate triggers narrative liberation, narrowing options to shelve the book with visible cost (scarf’s weight). Escalation is lyrical but lacks tangible opposition beyond geometry’s bend, softening pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the final image: stories live "in the charged interval between reader and read," reweighting the scarf’s copper from oxidized relic to vessel of analog memory. Avoids moralizing by embedding wisdom in tactile details like the "warm sepia of remembered sunlight."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in "parquet creaks" avoidance and "footnotes and heartbeats" hush. Rhythmic control peaks in "equations unfolded into narratives" cadence, with hyperbolic geometry taught through visceral "aisles lengthening" rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "hot toner and cold starlight" exemplifies high-density texture. Minor register drift in "dormant equations" risks abstraction, but "drool pooling into a perfect Möbius strip" pays off with concrete strangeness, avoiding figurative muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes scientific precision ("(θ, φ) = (i, ln 2)") with poetic vulnerability ("guardian of the hour when solitude is observed"), transforming library tropes through analog memory’s physicality. Risk-taking in hyperbolic geometry feels inevitable, charging stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
