<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority rich but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; micro-choices under pressure strong (apology to sharkskin, heartbeat counting), yet final choice lacks visible internal conflict escalation beyond determination.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost ("weight lifted, replaced by lightness") under Accumulative lens; orientation anchors by 40 words, lens clarity impeccable with density building toward pearl's exhale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sea glass constrains every choice (polishing method, weight perception) and charges final image ("memory of green"); mist/grotto actively shapes tactics (hushing pebbles, coiling lullabies) while avoiding symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize early ("share light without fire"); pressure tightens through Lira's agency (polishing as method) under Accumulative lens, with cost legible in "weight lifted" and spared wicks—no coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment><comment>Theme emerges through sea glass transformation ("carry silence and light") not moralizing; final image reweights "zephyr bloom" into shared auroras, avoiding sentimentality though secondary "pearl" motif slightly overemphasized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("breath mingling with haze," "trembling constellations") modulates rhythm under pressure; no head-hopping, with psychic distance shifts intentional (memories anchoring present action).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "reflectively vibrant" appears twice but earns progression (physical trait → emotional resonance), though "zephyr bloom" repetition risks slight overwriting in final beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gem polishing as emotional labor transforms familiar "pearl" trope; specificity ("sharkskin," "anemone silk") grounds universals without quirks, though drought backstory lacks causal integration.</comment>
