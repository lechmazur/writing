<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied ("scorch of legacy," unraveling threads into equations) but lacks contradictory impulses in peak beats; final choice feels earned yet slightly abstract without deeper character contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (gear stopping = broken pattern), but the Accumulative/Textural lens risks under-escalating pressure; cost legible in "grief plus time" equation yet causal progression feels atmospheric rather than driven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: plasma moss and gear constrain choices (unraveling threads, slowing clicks) and charge the final image; nebula’s "troubling serenity" mirrors internal state without cliché, though oxygen-cloud petal falls verge on ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (breaking generational fire) deepen through the gear’s clicking escalation, but protagonist agency feels passive; song resolves conflict without visible tactical cost beyond emotional weight, weakening pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars (light/fire dichotomy, gear notches as escape maps); final equation reweights legacy without moralizing, achieving earned resonance through the gear’s stillness as conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("finger of coherent light," "modulation of pure frequency") sustains voice under pressure, but rhythmic density occasionally drifts into ornate abstraction ("bruise-blue humming with lullaby") risking POV modesty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops with high density, yet "sonar pinging" metaphor recurs with slight muddle (memory vs. nebula hush); final line’s abrupt cutoff ("the light") risks closure ambiguity despite intentional lyric compression.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic grief and generational mechanics via the gear, avoiding sentimentality; "light inherited without ignition" reconfigures familiar tropes with emotional specificity, though nebula-as-metaphor edges toward common SF lexicon.</comment>
