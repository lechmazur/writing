<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority excels in concrete details like "petrichor was her only inheritance," but "sensibly eccentric" trait lacks visible tradeoffs; final renunciation (releasing compass) earns closure with felt cost through "lungs aching in that luxurious way."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Orientation debt: who/where/when unclear past 120 words ("sub-basements still smelled of approaching rain" lacks spatial anchor), triggering -0.4 penalty; closure as Charged Poise lands with cost in "lungs aching" and "heart forgiving itself" under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Subterranean lagoon functions as micro-setting that constrains every choice (rope "ticking like cooling engine," marble beach navigation); recurring compass directly charges final image ("map... unfolded with every step"), satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency under Accumulative lens: "delve" action narrows options by committing to water colder than "wages never paid," with cost legible in "dust-kernel of memory" loss; dominant stake ("find where explanations fail") crystallizes stance without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image ("petals of afternoon rain rehearsing descent") reweights "explanations fail" theme through concrete action, avoiding moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "hush remained, resonant" without false equivalence or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in character-particular noticing ("tasted of rust," "water black and glossy like untold confession"); rhythmic control modulates under pressure ("rope over shoulder ticking like cooling engine") with patterned elision taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-miss overwriting ("mineral sweetness that rose like memory") balanced by exceptional propulsion; zero scaffold/loops, but one borderline metaphor in high-pressure beat prevents 9.0 despite flawless closure rhythm ("flask clinking against rhythm of newly hinged heart").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms factory shutdown trope through petrichor motif and "hinged awakenings" concept; refusal of mythic transcendence ("could have pushed through") demonstrates bold risk-taking that heightens emotional truth without gimmickry.</comment>
