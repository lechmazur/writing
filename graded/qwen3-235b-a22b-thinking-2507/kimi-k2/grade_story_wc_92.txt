<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lira’s "calmly inventive" sabotage versus orders to "speak to no one," with micro-choices like sigil-scratching revealing hierarchy of values. Motivation slightly thin early but redeemed by tangible cost in bird programming and "borrowed fire" final touch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "borrowed fire" and "lock is awake" pamphlet crystallize revolution’s irreversible momentum under Accumulative lens. Orientation flawless; cost proof evident in final line’s "warm with borrowed fire" reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bronze quill holder functions as micro-setting, constraining three key choices (sigil, sundial alignment, bird programming) and charging closure via "glinting like a secret kept." Sensory specificity in "hot metal and parchment" scent elevates beyond backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Blackout’s time pressure tightens decisively via sundial coordinates ("seventeen clicks left"), but urgency lacks visceral escalation—cost feels conceptual rather than immediate. Agency strong in Lira’s choices, though blackout’s origin remains untested pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through brass birds’ "cursive fire" and "spiral-within-spiral" seal reweighting revolution as whispered constellations, avoiding moralizing. Final image’s "conspiratorial wink" offers resonant answer to "hoarded light" without stating theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature sharp in "violet afterglow" and "pupils adjusting" details; rhythm modulates from "hush of a world gone suddenly dark" to urgent "seventeen clicks." Zero head-hopping; voice remains Lira’s tactile, tool-focused lens under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "trailing a faint ribbon of sparks that spelled ‘NOW’" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor deduction for "calmly inventive" label (Q1 bleed), but peak beats ("heart loud in ears") avoid figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transformation of "cradle of sparks" from myth to tangible forge with brass birds avoids trope; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes. Specificity in "copper nib" and "seventeen clicks" creates freshness without quirk.</comment>
