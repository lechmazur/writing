<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (gentleness vs anger) act simultaneously during scalpel work; final choice to report while protecting chameleons earns closure with visible cost in "shed another layer: the need to be seen as purely good."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost in "shimmering stillness settle inside her bones, no longer fragile but tensile"; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through layered realizations without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tail tip functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (reconstruction method) and charges closure (twitching reflex); workshop details actively pressure tactics via bio-gel drawer and broken terrariums.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (balancing self-respect/compassion) tightens through Mara's agency in reconstruction; cost legible in "righteous action could coexist with regret" during incubator activation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tail reconstruction as metaphor ("each cell placed was a small refusal of the con man’s narrative"); final twitching image reweights "fragile convictions" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("microscopic scales catching starlight like shattered opal") with rhythmic control; tension compresses diction during scalpel work while maintaining handler-specific observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; "quietly vivid" abstraction in Q9D causes minor thematic drift but no closure impact; density peaks during incubator sequence without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma recovery through scientific reconstruction; "shedding layers" transformed from cliché into embodied action (sweeping glass as "discarded illusions") with non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>
