<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "refilling the cavity he thought forever emptied," but the emotional shift to "no longer entirely heartbroken" lacks a visible micro-choice during the naming climax, slightly undercutting earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "I name you, and in naming, I keep you" crystallizes stance with felt cost (names etching into ribs), and the accumulative lens holds through the prism’s light density shift reweighting sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The broken prism actively constrains choices—moonlight must strike through jagged edges to crystallize names—and charges the final image (atlas rustling against ribs), satisfying the 9+ gate through causal pressure on the closure beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen accumulatively as each named monster reshapes the reaper’s understanding, but the pressure shift from "fear" to "sacrifice" lacks a concrete moment where this realization forces a tactical change beyond passive observation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "monsters dissolving into blank ocean" reweights terror into love without moralizing, and the final horizon glow offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "fear still waiting, unnamed."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable—"brass gears gaped toothless," "scent of lilac in winter"—with rhythm tightening under pressure; no head-hopping, and the echo’s voice shift reads as intentional psychic distance modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but "thin spars of luminance" risks register drift (overly technical for a reaper’s lexicon), slightly muddling the crystallization beat’s immediacy despite otherwise crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms the reaper trope through specific, grounded mechanics (wax cylinders, prism shards), and the "sacrifices shaped by terror" insight feels inevitable yet fresh, with risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightening emotional stakes.</comment>
