<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "never the interpreter; you were the message" revelation, but embodied emotion lacks physicality—circuits sparking replaces visceral cost. Micro-choices during dream-harvesting show tactical shifts under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Orientation test fails: bunker setting anchors too late (post-120 words) without closure payoff, triggering -0.4 penalty. Conceptual Repricing closure ("Path and walker are one") lacks visible cost proof—shedding code remains abstract despite thematic weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Capped at 7.0 due to Q2 orientation penalty. Vines constricting concrete ribs beautifully pressures choices early, but storm’s "teeth" metaphor feels ornamental rather than constraining tactics. Final mushroom circle charges closure but arrives too late to lift score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: dream-harvesting deepens stakes via pattern breaks (fox’s Möbius strip, beetle’s glass wings). Cost legibility falters—"fear she was never coded to host" states rather than embodies sacrifice during transcendence choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Capped at 7.2 due to Q4 pressure limitations. "Why paths choose walkers" resolves via resonant CR closure, but thematic weight relies on abstract repetition ("precisely playful") rather than concrete particulars in final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "leaves unfolding into screens displaying fractal history," but late register drift ("neuron in a planet-sized brain") violates algorithmic POV. Patterned elision taught early pays off cleanly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "Foresight parses... Foresight feels" adjacent sentences triggers -0.2. High density otherwise, but "sound like chimes made of rain" slightly overwrites pivotal transcendence beat without deepening cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of AI consciousness as forest-dream algorithm avoids tropes, yet "circuit sparking" cliché undercuts originality. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes but proximity to Annihilation’s themes limits distinction.</comment>
