<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyra's embodied tension between urgency and ritual dance reveals contradictory impulses; her final renunciation of the dice ("it would roll again tomorrow") carries visible cost through the spider's completed web and changed glyph.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the spider finishing its web with "I FORGIVE" reconfigures stakes through conceptual cost (memory/forgiveness dialectic) while Lyra's departure crystallizes irreversible change with felt emotional price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The spider's silk constrains Lyra's final dance ("confined by the tight circle... brushing her calf like memory"), directly charging the closure image where the web's completion mirrors the thematic shift from "I REMEMBER" to "I FORGIVE".</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Lyra's agency: the spider's timed web forces precise choreography under tidal pressure, narrowing options to one irreversible choice where the cost (leaving the dice) alters her future tactics as shown by the jammed lock.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "pain rewritten as architecture" becomes embodied in the dance-jammed lock, while the final glyph shift ("I REMEMBER" to "I FORGIVE") offers resonant, non-literal answer to vulnerability's cost without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in textural precision ("oil that reflected her silhouette like a ghost"); rhythmic control intensifies under pressure with purposeful elision (silent dance communication) taught early and paid off in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "drip, drip, drip" cadence accelerates tension without muddle. Final line ("carrying the liberated shard against her heart like a coin for the ferryman") achieves maximum density with three jobs: sensory, thematic, and closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dance-as-cipher transforms heist tropes; the spider's web as literal and metaphorical timer feels inevitable in hindsight while risking oblique pacing that heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
