<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through texture-based time perception; embodied emotions ("exquisite ache of recognizing time’s fingerprints") avoid diagnostic labels while micro-choices (embedding messages, pressing fragment) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("exquisite ache," "secret currency to spend") under Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation anchors who/where/when by paragraph 1, with "pulse beneath it paused" proving cost legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Emerald silo functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (decade-specific steps) and charges closure (vibrating swallows beneath paint); recurring urn fragment’s fusion with gear directly shapes final image’s tactile revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Protagonist’s agency drives escalation through texture-based deepening ("silk: hospital curtains... gravel: driveway"), with visible cost in the "residue of anticipation" that reweights time’s value under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image ("future arrive as velvet") resonates as non-literal answer to "map of how it feels to wait," avoiding moralizing while charging prior material through grandmother’s whispered code; theme emerges from concrete texture metaphors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "time as texture" lexicon; rhythmic control under pressure ("First came silk... Then gravel... Then honey") teaches pattern early with no head-hopping or register drift in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances density ("urn fragment pulsed like a second tongue") with crystal-clear propulsion; no figurative muddle in closure beat where "velvet" recharges the opening’s texture motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms time capsule trope through tactile time perception; risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, making "texture as currency" feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
