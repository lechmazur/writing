<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via embodied specifics ("ache of salt in lungs," "patience of nets never emptied") but final transformation into "burning, walking resonance" lacks sufficient micro-choice escalation during climax, slightly undermining causality of surrender.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "let her pulse race unchecked" paired with spike turning "glowing brand" crystallizes cost of surrendering coolness under Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation anchors ("sound wave garden," sleepwalking constellations) established by paragraph 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rail spike functions as micro-setting—constraining choices when driven into loam and charging final image as "tuning fork"; sound garden’s evolving rules ("grass spelled out old coastal names") actively pressure tactics without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Lira’s agency (humming back, zigzagging) tightening pressure until goddess’s "tide of hush" forces irreversible choice; cost of surrendered coolness ("burning, walking resonance") unmistakably charges final image under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of divine communion’s cost emerges through concrete particulars: iron’s "skeleton of every lullaby" evolving into "glowing brand," avoiding moralizing; final image ("feral lullaby") offers resonant non-literal answer to "someone must bear witness" without stating moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("Orion dragging his belt like a drunkard," "tasted of moonlit mussels") modulates rhythm under pressure; purposeful elision ("patterns breaking themselves") taught early and paid off in zigzagging sky closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("impact rang out as low C that bent upward into question mark") with clear propulsion, though "Pleiades yawning ultraviolet" risks figurative muddle yet remains legible within garden’s established rules.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fishing/divinity through sound physics ("transliterated emotions into audible color"); rail spike’s evolution from "cold iron" to "glowing brand" transforms trope into indispensable cost-carrier, avoiding safety middle via visceral surrender.</comment>
