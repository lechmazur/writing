<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("certainty cracked harder than marble") and embodied emotion ("fingers that cannot bend yet ache with antique mercy") avoid therapy-speak. Final choice to thread filament earns change through prior telepathic vulnerability, but single-POV limits relationship crucible assessment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands decisively: "kindness—incisive, warm, structural—creates a new beginning" reweights the city's memory rule-set with visible cost (structural weakness repaired through sacrifice). Accumulative lens holds perfectly; orientation anchors by word 15.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting (ampoule's "hairline fracture" and "calcified sinew") constrains Aurele's threading action and charges the final image ("veins glowing faint foxglove"). Sensory details filtered through statue's telepathic perception avoid tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (welcoming nuance into certainty) tightens through revelation density under Accumulative lens. Aurele's agency in naming "accommodation" forecloses rigidity with felt cost ("structural weakness—awaits thread"), avoiding coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "garden was never abandoned; it was left like a will" reframes hope without moralizing. Final image ("animate lifeless will keep beat") offers resonant non-literal answer to central question of memory's role.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("thought, warm as silt"; "petrified nerves") persists under pressure. Third-person limited POV stays welded to Aurele's telepathic reality without leakage, though "incisively kind" repetition slightly flattens rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "prismatic droplets each carrying shared history" achieves high density without muddle. Final line "rewoven with foxglove light" recharges motif with clear propulsion, avoiding overwriting in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms underwater city trope through telepathic "structural weakness" metaphor. Risk distinction (+0.3) for unconventional closure where kindness becomes literal architecture, avoiding safety-middle hedging.</comment>
