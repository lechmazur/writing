<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira's contradictory impulses as recorder/resistor drive the climax; "luminous regret" embodies earned cost through tactile stone ritual. Slight abstraction in emotional labeling prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost ("joy/sorrow" + bound shadow), but video analysis happens off-page, softening causal escalation slightly at midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>River stone functions as essential micro-setting: constrains Lira's action (placement ritual) and charges final image ("pulse with rhythm of distant water"). Library mechanics slightly generic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally from shadow sighting to irreversible metamorphosis, with naming ritual as earned agency. Initial shadow description lacks urgency for top-band escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Final image ("shadow contains memory of light") offers resonant non-literal answer to hope preservation, earned through stone's riverbed history. Thematic phrasing skirts abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bruise of night," "fragrance of remembered summers") with rhythmic control, though "softly deliberate" repetition slightly disrupts climax tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>No loops in peak beats; "filament of light" metaphor serves action cleanly. "Luminous regret" borders on thematic cliché but saved by concrete embodiment in stone's pulse.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library as living entity threatened by its shadow, though "shadow unbound" concept echoes cosmic horror tropes without full transformation.</comment>
