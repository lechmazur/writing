<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias' "inadvertently stubborn" refusal to let memories unrested, embodied through micro-choices like writing his own name despite hesitation. Bleeding ink-and-salt fingers reveal cost, but brief backstory about burying villagers lacks concrete present-moment impact on tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: the shattering lens becomes a whole beacon, reconfiguring "distress signals" into guidance. Under Accumulative lens, density peaks when Elias writes his name—visible cost in "lens cracked further" and "fingers bled ink and salt" crystallizes the stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The broken lens functions as micro-setting, constraining choices from cradling to shattering while charging the final image (light piercing waves). Sensory details like "books floated like jellyfish" avoid cliché, but coral-and-bone staircase could deepen pressure on movement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("gaps in the ledger of the dead") tightens through accumulation as names appear, culminating in Elias writing his own—a meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable: physical (bleeding fingers), conceptual (his death), and tactical (library collapse forcing ascent).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: "distress signals are not loud" evolves into the lighthouse guiding "the lost home," avoiding moralizing. Final line reweights prior material non-literally—"never again go unanswered" crystallizes the cost of silence without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: undertaker noticing "cracked halo" and "barnacled domes" filters all observation. Rhythmic control peaks during writing ("He recognized some:...") with compression under pressure; no head-hopping despite lyrical shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold—every line propels narrative: "the sea did not resist him. Instead, it parted" compresses causality and character. Final image ("light sweep across the waves") recharges "distress signals" motif with crystalline clarity, no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms undertaker trope through specific, grounded choices: revitalizing the dead via blood-ink inscription avoids safety-middle risk. Emotional truth in "names without graves" synthesizes universal stakes with irreplaceable details like the child "who ran too far into the tide."</comment>
