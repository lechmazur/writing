<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara's duty versus recognition of her own vow; embodied emotion in "trembling fingers" measuring the harmonic. Final renunciation (releasing vows) is earned by her erosion of memory, but sister backstory lacks sufficient micro-choice anchoring.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: library dissolving while Elara stands at "edge of nothing" crystallizes the cost of release. Accumulative lens holds—sensory density builds to this moment without causality breaks. "Meaning created in letting go" reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen library constrains every choice (window release into void) and charges the final image (walls becoming water vapor). Aurora-compressed ledger and melting lantern slide transform setting into active constraint, not backdrop. Micro-setting mastery elevates to 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (preserve vs. release vows) tightens when Elara recognizes her vow's resonance; her agency in opening the window forecloses preservation path. Cost is visceral in the library dissolving around her. Escalation driven purely by perceptual deepening under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "meaning created in letting go" shown via releasing slides, not stated. Final image (light becoming skin luminescence) reweights the vows' transformation without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality through specificity of "mercury tears" and "quartz chronometer."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature blends scientific precision ("sampling frequencies") with poetic diction ("breath crystallizing into tiny prisms"). Refrain "while illusions faded to memory" teaches pattern early; rhythmic control intensifies pressure in the release sequence without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "liquid light that rolled like mercury tears" exemplifies high-density imagery. Final beat ("melted in her palm... gentle luminescence") avoids figurative muddle while charging closure. Sentence rhythm accelerates during release sequence without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: luminous vows as dying civilizations' promises measured like scientific data transforms elegy into active dilemma. Emotional truth in Elara's forgotten sister avoids abstraction, but risk-taking stops short of full conceptual disruption seen in top-tier 9.0+ works.</comment>
