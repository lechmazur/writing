<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "unlearning was not loss but permission" moment, with embodied emotion via trembling fingers and quivering antennae. Final renunciation of words earned through chalk interjection choices, though flaw depth lacks specific struggle beyond thematic abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: worn chalk nub and tile flake become "conspirators against noise" as passersby kneel, reconfiguring silence's value. Accumulative lens holds flawlessly through mandala's evolution into pavement art.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mandala sand and chalk nub constrain choices—worn-down chalk forces pocketing the flake, charging the final image. Mist's lilac-to-dawn shift mirrors internal change without overt symbolism, while tile flake's vibration drives tactile discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through the Accumulative lens: "lilac unease" tightening into bruise-purple mist as the flake reveals "promise to forget love," culminating in visible cost of chalk worn to nub. Agency in widening the mandala forecloses verbal expression with earned renunciation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "meaning could be beautiful even when it vanished" as memories dissolve into pigment, avoiding moralizing. Final pavement mandala offers non-literal answer: silence shared as communal hush, reweighting unlearning as permission rather than loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "socially perceptive antennae quivering" and mist "tinting bruise-purple." Rhythmic control peaks with "soundless, yet the grotto shivered," compressing stress while maintaining voice coherence through lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in closure beats, but "emergent hush that thickened whenever someone tried to speak aloud" slightly overwrites. High density maintained ("tile flake lifted, spinning slowly above the design"), though "moth wings" simile risks decorative redundancy without deeper integration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "unlearning" as active permission transforms familiar art-heals trope. Bold risk in making silence the protagonist's tool, with specificity in "road maps of silence" charging emotional truth without quirky ornamentation.</comment>
