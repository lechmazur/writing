<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "empathy in motion" philosophy versus physical strain ("stone under ribs"); embodied sorrow in throat ache during key resonance beat avoids abstraction. Final kneeling choice earns endurance through micro-choices like lichen strumming adjustments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: birds' tentative song reconfigures silence with visible cost (sculptor's heart tremor against porcelain). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—density increase from single A-flat to chorus tightens stakes without causal breaks. Cost proof in "throat aches with borrowed sorrow" preceding the exhale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Alder grove constrains every choice: bark "ear" receives insulator, woodpecker scars yield specific notes. Final image charges porcelain's glow with returned song. Micro-setting mastery—lichen as string, cracks as syllables—directly shapes the adagio's creation and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: gathering micro-resonances (B-minor grief, wounded D) deepens knowledge until the spiral crack demands embodied action. Cost crystallizes when exhaling "first note the grove has felt," risking further silence—paid in visceral throat ache before the payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: "teaching silence how to breathe" reweights "hidden grief" through porcelain’s vibration. Final image (glowing cracks, sleeping hedgehog) offers non-literal answer to "restore what was lost" without moralizing. Avoids abstraction by rooting empathy in lichen strums and wood fibers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature defines "symphonically minded" POV: hearing "percussion in falling cones," translating stress cracks to syllables. Rhythmic control peaks during high-pressure strumming ("fingertips grazing scars") with taught lyric compression. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance shrinks to bodily vibration during closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "crazed with hairline fractures that catch the dawn the way dew catches breath" exemplifies high-density imagery. Sentence rhythm varies perfectly with pressure—staccato for spines parting ("reluctant curtains"), legato for adagio creation. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms "silent grove" trope through specific sonic archaeology: woodpecker scars as musical notation, insulator as history vessel. Risk-taking heightens stakes—porcelain’s fragility during exhale—without gimmickry. Emotional truth in "belly exposed in trust" avoiding anthropomorphism.</comment>
