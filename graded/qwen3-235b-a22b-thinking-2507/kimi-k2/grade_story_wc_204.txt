<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "perfection bored her" vs seeking rupture; micro-choices like uncorking "Farewell" then "Remember" reveal value hierarchy under pressure. Only slight abstraction in "beautiful violence" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: library dissolving while whispers become new stories reweights perfection with undeniable conceptual cost ("feeling eternity compress"). Accumulative lens holds from "perfection bored her" through fracturing frost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glass orchard actively constrains choices—books slide like birds, frost cracks under whispers, cloud-sea rises to engulf. Final image of frost resolving into her future selves charges closure with environmental cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through operator’s agency: uncorking "Farewell" (jagged frost) → reversing gears ("unprinting") → drinking "Forever". Cost crystallizes in "feeling eternity compress into this single, perfect moment of falling".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the press’s wet ink shifting into "What wakes when systems sleep?" Final image of frost resolving into her future selves answers the central question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: "whispers rustled like moth wings", "press groaned like an iceberg calving". Rhythm modulates from lyrical ("chandelier of frozen breath") to staccato ("She smiled") under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary propulsion ("The library shuddered" vs "vaporous fingers reaching"). "Glass breaking into song" finale achieves high density without figurative muddle—every image tightens closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms library tropes via frost-pattern taxonomy; "rustling awakenings" as tangible forces feels inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric collapse) heightens stakes without gimmickry, following "negotiable reality" implications relentlessly.</comment>
