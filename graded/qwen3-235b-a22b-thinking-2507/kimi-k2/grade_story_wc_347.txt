<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between duty and release is embodied in actions (kernel as compass), but internal conflict lacks layered escalation; final renunciation of orchard feels earned though cost remains subtly implied rather than viscerally charged on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (kernel’s release signaling inherited burden), but frost’s arrival slightly softens the stakes’ final impact; Accumulative lens holds with density tightening pressure through blueprint assembly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nut functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (oil rearranging blueprints) and charges the final image (footprints as moonlight); sensory details like "rasped branches" and "moldy lace" sky filter urgency through Nadia’s embodied perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through Nadia’s agency—frost deadline forces blueprint assembly—but hikers’ safety resolves too neatly without visible tactical cost beyond kernel release; pressure deepens via wind-whispering mechanics under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-burden resonates through orchard’s calcified family and discarded blueprints; final image ("footprints carved from moonlight") reweights release as cyclical duty without moralizing, though hikers’ escape slightly dilutes conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cupping a dropped heartbeat") persists under stress with rhythmic control; compression of "twilight curled the sky" serves Accumulative urgency, though minor register drift occurs in "unbroken corridor that glowed a graceless beauty".</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density falters in blueprint assembly beat where "flashed and rearranged" risks abstraction; no loops but "pearl varnish" and "moldy lace" verge on overwriting without payoff in peak pressure moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical birds and nut-as-compass avoids genre clichés; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens emotional truth, though cliffside labyrinth’s logic slightly strains coherence during path assembly.</comment>
