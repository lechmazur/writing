<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "phobia screamed but I was firmly adaptive" as micro-choices (decrypting cast, climbing stairs) reveal hierarchy of values. Twin's thin motivation slightly weakens relationship crucible despite strong embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost in burning contracts ("sparks rising to join the stars"), but twin's sudden rooftop appearance lacks causal setup, creating minor coincidence-resolves flaw under Hybrid lens dominant at end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rusted library functions as micro-setting that charges closure: girders "flexing like spine" mirror awakening agency, while floor safe and projection booth actively constrain choices throughout the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency (deciphering cast, rewinding film), but confrontation with twin lacks escalation—betrayal flickers but no meaningful trade-off precedes the burning, muting the cost's impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "vulnerability was power" reframed in final image ("ground not as crash but landing"), avoiding moralizing. No thematic echo despite early statement, as concrete actions earn the shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("moonlight dripping like molten silver," "ink ghosts") persists under pressure; rhythmic control peaks in climax with "rewound the reel, studying smudged notes again." Zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fresh scratches—someone had spliced betrayal" shows high-density propulsion. Final line’s "place to crash/place to land" delivers crystalline closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stunt-double trope through "rustled library" setting and cast decryption mechanic. Risk-taking (lyric tension) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though twin's arrival lacks transformative groundwork.</comment>
