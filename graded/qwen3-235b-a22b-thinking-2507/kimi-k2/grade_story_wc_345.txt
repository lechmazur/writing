<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Luma’s altruism lacks contradictory impulses; her dissolution feels inevitable but unearned through prior struggle. Kiran’s motivation is strong (child raised by machines discovering family), yet the ghost’s final choice lacks visible internal friction despite brambled hope description.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with Luma’s dissolution anchoring the nebula, costing her existence. Hybrid lens (Causal/Accumulative) holds: chalk messages accumulate pressure until the net-weaving causes tangible resolution. Backstory "plague of forgetting" told not dramatized slightly weakens causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard Planet’s setting constrains every choice: nebula dew as filament, floating arches dictating spatial choreography. "Watering bell" functions as micro-setting—its enamel wetness enables galaxy-droplets, charging the final image where it becomes perpetual dew.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when arches crack, forcing the net-weaving choice with visible cost (fatigue/fear). Kiran’s proposal drives agency under Hybrid lens, but the nebula’s thinning isn’t dramatized as escalating pressure—signaled early but lacks mid-scene intensification before climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "brambled hope" and chalk reexamination—final image of strangers tending orchards answers "family" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by embedding wisdom in Luma’s message, though "strangers become family" risks slight redundancy in closing line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Luma’s "translucent hands brushing petals" vs. Kiran’s machine-raised wonder. Rhythmic control peaks in "droplets scattered into the air and formed miniature galaxies that hummed with brambled hope"—no head-hopping despite multi-POV Track C execution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "nebula of respite" avoids purple prose by serving tactical function (dew as filament). Minor overwriting in "hope tangled with thorns of doubt" risks therapy-speak but stays anchored in concrete action (bell-ringing).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "orchard planet" and cosmic stakes—floating arches as both setting and fragile bridges. Risk-taking in ghost-as-organizer succeeds through chalk’s specificity; avoids derivative tropes by making altruism a visible cost (dissolution), not abstract virtue.</comment>
