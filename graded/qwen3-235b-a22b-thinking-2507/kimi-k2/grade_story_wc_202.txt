<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (follow children vs. carry story back) earned through grandmother memory; embodied cost in trembling-hands trade; single-POV interiority avoids diagnostic labels under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance ("role is not to follow") with visceral cost (truthful memory exchanged); Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation to "colors braid into a rope"; cost proof explicit in salt-price transaction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lighthouse fragment functions as micro-setting constraining choices (pressing to canvas, projecting prisms) and charges final image ("fragment quiet against my palm"); selective sensory details (salt wind, storm-blue pigment) filtered through translator's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (histories as sails not chains) signaled by sister's whisper; deepening through color translation reweights options; protagonist agency drives escalation (pressing fragment, stepping through, choosing to remain) with irrevocable cost (memory sacrifice).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (indigo boat pinned, seeking next canvas), not moralizing; final image of ship changing course offers resonant non-literal answer to translation's purpose; avoids thematic echo while charging "elusively tangible" weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("elusively tangible," "salt wind") with rhythmic control under pressure; compression taught early ("Between childhood and now") pays off in tidal time; no head-hopping despite painter's presence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; peak-beat figurative language ("colors braid into a rope") enhances clarity; final line avoids muddle while charging closure ("Somewhere below, a ship changes course"); syntactic variety mirrors emotional cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of translation as embodied practice (thumb-smooth glass, salt price); transforms "lighthouse" trope through specific stakes (violet of dusk before electricity); risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens emotional truth without gimmickry.</comment>
