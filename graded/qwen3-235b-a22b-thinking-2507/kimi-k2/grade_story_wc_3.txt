<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction crystallizes in pivotal scar-tracing moment: "haunted ambitions... thinned like fog, replaced by simpler ache." Final renunciation (bowing, not picking fruit) earned through embodied micro-choices under pressure; no diagnostic labels, only palpable transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: golden fruit's "weightless as memory" crystallizes the irreversible trade of ambition for humility. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—silence teaching dialect reweights stakes with each branch, cost legible in "quiet library of questions" replacing howling ambitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Magnetic arbor functions as micro-setting that constrains every choice: polarized bark dictates climbing method, DINGIR formation demands seed placement. Final image charged by recurring object—golden fruit's weightlessness directly reweights the opening "obsidian seed," proving environment shapes closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by Lila's agency: tracing scar to "unbecome" translation narrows options to pure conversation with the seed. Cost unmistakable—"haunted ambitions settled into quiet library" shows visible forfeiture of academic identity, reconfiguring her stance at the crown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "root... ask permission" becomes the resonant answer to "how consciousness survives translation." Final scar-line reweights prior material without moralizing—"moving with words" crystallizes earned wisdom through specific experience, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "humming grew quieter... silence itself were a dialect" shows character-particular noticing. Rhythmic control under pressure—fragmented clauses during seed-cracking ("not to pull... but to ask permission") teach pattern early, paid off in the lullaby closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence multi-tasks: "boots sticking... as if tree wished to keep her" conveys setting + motivation. Figurative language precise in peak beats ("root of pure information"), never muddling causality. Final line's "humming... lullaby" avoids overwriting while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cuneiform logic applied to afterlife physics transforms tropes. Emotional specificity in "smug certainty of peer review" → "quiet library of questions" avoids genericity. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without obscuring the earned cost of ambition's dissolution.</comment>
