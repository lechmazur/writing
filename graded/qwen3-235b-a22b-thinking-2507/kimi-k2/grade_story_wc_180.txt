<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (trading eye for skill vs mending family), but "endearingly feisty" is label-only until daughter appears late, missing micro-choices under pressure for 0.3 deduction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise: linked wrists/petals as "soft amendments") lands with undeniable conceptual cost ("sweet rot that feeds bloom"), but lens ambiguity precludes 9.0+ as Accumulative/Textural dominance isn't named by midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard actively constrains choices (branches as scaffolding, memory-fruit altering tactics) and charges the final image ("petals drifted down like soft amendments"), meeting 9+ gate with environmental pressure shaping every beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by mender's agency (climbing, using bag contents) narrows options to the daughter confrontation; cost ("sweet rot") legible in transformation of breach, with "persist" action redefining stakes at every rung.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through graft metaphor ("old wood must split so new can grow") without moralizing; final image ("town began, accidentally, to forgive itself") reweights the premise as resonant non-literal answer to generational rupture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("stained glass shards that once sang with hymns") and rhythmic control under pressure are exceptional, but "endearingly feisty" breaks POV consistency with authorial intrusion (-0.3).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "persist upward" is minor scaffold but high density ("sap weeping like hot wax") and final line’s "accidentally, to forgive itself" avoid sentimentality while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms familiar tropes through specific mechanics (quartz lens from eye, fruit tasting of secrets); risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, with "accidental wisdom" as fresh inflection.</comment>
