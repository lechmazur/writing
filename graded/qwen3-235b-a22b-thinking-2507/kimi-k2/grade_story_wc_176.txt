<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "forgiving herself for names melted away" versus "snowmelt ardor of forgiveness," embodied through micro-choices like reconfiguring rope braids. Flaws (war guilt) directly compound choices without safety-hedging, though secondary pressure is absent per scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "she had not restored the lost wax, but she had restored what the wax had lost." Accumulative lens holds through rope resonance, aurora dimming, and glowing footprints. Minor lens ambiguity in "technically gentle" repetition prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Icebound sanctum constrains choices (frost-sealed door, ice steps) and charges closure via melting droplets becoming "notes" and glowing footprints. Aurora’s refraction actively shapes the ritual, though "snowmelt ardor" edges toward overwritten texture in one instance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving forgotten names) tighten through rope reconfiguration, with cost legible in her visceral memories of Lina/Tor/Arin. Agency drives escalation, but "technically gentle" lacks tangible constraint on action, slightly weakening trade-off clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: names erased in war restored as vibration, not metal. Final image ("names safe at last in the sound of morning") offers resonant answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo through sensory specificity like beeswax impressions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters details through caster’s craft lens ("braids holding tension of coronations"). Rhythm modulates under pressure—shorter sentences during rope work—though "technically gentle" slightly disrupts lexicon consistency in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density: "holes spelled a melody she had hummed while casting death" compresses history into image. Only flaw is "technically gentle" repetition bordering on scaffold, but closure remains razor-sharp with "children hearing something familiar."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms war memorial trope through lost-wax specificity; rope-as-soundwave feels inevitable. Emotional truth in "molten metal swallowed the name" avoids sentimentality. Risk-taking (aurora as memory river) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
