<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "muffled clarity, syllables wrapped in felt yet sharp as glass shards," but demon’s hesitation lacks embodied emotion; micro-choices under pressure (palette lift, pedal taps) earn closure yet emotional progression feels abstracted at peak stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: demon dissolving into assumption-letters while lattice hums "acknowledgment" reconfigures meaning with visceral cost (cassock’s lost shimmer). Accumulative lens holds—silence layers narrow options relentlessly, and "unraveled stillness" tremor directly triggers the final heartbeat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dimensional anchor’s lattice vibrating in Morse code constrains the priest’s actions (reading tremors as method), charging the final image where letters "reinforcing the threads." Body/tool specificity excels—loop pedal’s "red eye blinking like a cautious confession" becomes tactile pressure in high-stakes beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate texturally: each loop pedal reversal ("inevitability excuses surrender") tightens the silence, foreclosing possession through rhetorical rigor. Cost crystallizes in the priest’s drained shimmer, but demon’s "I am the motion you refuse" lacks prior setup, slightly undercutting agency-driven escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: assumptions becoming "visible threads" tied into a bow rejects moralizing, while demon’s dissolution into spelled letters offers a non-literal answer to "hidden assumptions." Final image of "deeper quiet" resonates without stating the cost of illuminated truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice modulates perfectly under pressure—"soft as snowfall" for the priest’s smile versus "whispered axiom" for the demon. Perceptual signature shines in "wind forgot its name" and "pearlescent circle brightened," avoiding tourist cataloging while compressing reality through the priest’s lyrical lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose propulsion stumbles slightly in "forming a circle that decorates with silence" (redundant phrasing), but "palette rose... stretching into a ribbon" demonstrates masterful density. Zero figurative muddle in climax; final line’s "deeper quiet" charges closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes loop pedals and theological rhetoric into fresh conflict: "anaphora of nothing" transforms tropes through specific causal stakes. Risk-taking (silence as weapon) heightens coherence, while "assumptions as fiber optics" avoids generic symbolism by directly constraining the demon’s dissolution.</comment>
