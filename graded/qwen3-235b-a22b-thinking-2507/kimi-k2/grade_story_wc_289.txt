<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Arin's contradictory impulses (hoarding vs releasing secrets) drive her pivotal choice to offer the twig, earning the feather-lift relief with embodied cost. Elian's "unsent words like a second spine" reveals secondary pressure without diagnostic labels, though his backstory feels slightly summarized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "hearts not yet bruised nor built" crystallizes the bittersweet inevitability of connection. Accumulative lens holds flawlessly as steam-writing density reweights the "hidden thread" stake through visible filaments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lily pond actively charges closure by receiving words to generate glowing filaments—environment constrains the final image. Micro-setting (thrush twig) transforms from talisman to tuning fork, filtering perception through Arin's writerly lens without symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Arin's agency (releasing the twig), not coincidence, narrowing options to transparency. The steam-writing deepening reweights connection as visceral filaments, with cost unmistakable in "hearts not yet bruised" under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through image: abandoned words becoming connective filaments reweights "hidden thread" without moralizing. Final line ("hearts not yet bruised") offers resonant answer to connection's cost, avoiding sentimentality through concrete particularity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "puddles that held entire skies" and "wind tasting of lotus" reflect Arin's profession. Rhythm modulates under pressure ("thrush-nest twig hum at her pulse"), with dialogue carrying subtext ("Words fold small") and zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dimpling the air like returning swallows" achieves high density without muddle. Final line recharges opening's "fresh thought" with earned weight, while "boots splashing puddles" demonstrates propulsion through concrete verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ghostwriting as spiritual practice transforms clichés: secrets become physical filaments. Risk-taking (steam-writing magic) heightens stakes coherently, with lotus temple specificity preventing swappability—changing setting would break the reflective-petal mechanics.</comment>
