<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear but "empathetically decisive" trait remains stated rather than demonstrated through micro-choices; interior contradiction absent despite high-stakes language work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: silos' transformation shows irreversible reconfiguration with legible cost ("rust had fouled the seam like resentment" becoming "starch and rust and song were now sweet").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clock tower and silos function as micro-settings charging closure, but "whale-boned constellations" feels ornamental; starlight cupped in sleeves concretely constrains Sora's descent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through language escalation, but pressure lacks protagonist-driven agency; elevator's transformation feels coincidental rather than earned by Sora's specific choices with tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "The bridge was always wood willing to be whittled by many languages" reweights isolation without moralizing, using concrete silo transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("robes scented of library cedar"), but high-pressure beats over-rely on lyric density; "paper throat" metaphor risks obscuring causality despite voice consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Template cadence appears in climax ("She pressed... She spoke... She installed"); "sleeves of chalk halo" is overwritten scaffold, but closure beats maintain propulsion and clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "language as bridge" trope through specific cultural textures (Kiswahili/Dakota/Chimayó); "vigorously tender" tone modulates organically with pressure without gimmickry.</comment>
