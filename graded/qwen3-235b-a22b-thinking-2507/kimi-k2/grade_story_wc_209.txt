<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is concrete and embodied (grinding lapis, tracing etched glass), with earned renunciation in the candleless climax. Lacks layered contradictory impulses beyond quiet determination; "quietly driven" trait remains consistent without deeper internal friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: moonflower synchronization crystallizes her shift from seeking to witnessing, with visible cost in "quietly driven no longer by the need to understand." Accumulative lens holds through rhythmic cathedral visits and pigment mastery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Etched glass and lapis pigment constrain choices (candle shadows, violet depth), directly charging the final image where glass alignment enables the moonflower synchrony. Sensory details serve pressure: "wet earth and thawing pine" mirrors her thawing obsession.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency: her ritualistic cathedral visits and pigment grinding narrow options until the postcard's revelation forces renunciation. Cost is unmistakable—surrendering her childhood quest to "understand" for the privilege of "witness."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: moonflowers "answering an older invitation" reweights the central question non-literally. Final image ("moonflowers closed behind her like a book read aloud") resonates without moralizing, avoiding the Thematic Echo penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in artist's eye ("violet so deep it looked black until moonlight struck it") with rhythmic control. Minor register drift in "umbral tenderness" is redeemed by immediate embodiment ("as if night itself had cradled her unknowing").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("pigment and petal breathing together" does triple duty). Near-miss with "umbral tenderness" abstraction is rescued by tactile follow-up. Final line ("moonlight would keep them safe") resolves with crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: night-blooming as dialogue with darkness ("answering an older invitation") transforms familiar tropes through specific actions (postcard spiral, indigo snow pigment). Emotional truth in quiet closure avoids safety-middle hedging.</comment>
