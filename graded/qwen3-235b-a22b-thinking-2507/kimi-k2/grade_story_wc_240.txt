<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in the laser pointer's "promise she had not yet decided to keep" and embodied grief diffusion, but "physics of letting go" edges toward abstraction; micro-choices like tracing light circles reveal values under pressure without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with visceral cost ("grief out through pores") as barriers transform; Accumulative lens holds through sensory escalation to the rooted light lattice, where the farm's sigh becomes collective inhalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bioluminescent mushrooms actively constrain choices (vanishing laser reflection detects breach) and charge the final image ("grief now glowing in alien gardens"); permeable barriers evolve from static setting to breathing tissue that alters the protagonist's passage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rigid defense vs. permeable invitation) tightens through the light lattice scene, narrowing options to diffusion; cost is legible in "regret loosening into spores," though the stranger's role slightly dilutes protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: the lattice reconfigures "revolutionize a boundary" into "teach it to breathe," avoiding moralizing; final image of "mushrooms teaching the world to breathe through walls" resonates without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("read invisible currents like sailors read stars") and rhythmic control ("spores drifted like quiet wildfire") modulate under pressure; no head-hopping, with psychic distance shifting intentionally during the lattice vision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with "plastic kiss her cheeks like moth wings" charging atmosphere, but "spore-bright, willing to be breathed" slightly overwrites; zero loops yet final "quiet wildfire of dawn" risks cliché despite contextual freshness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of intrusion detection with fungal permeability ("walls into lungs") avoids tropes; risk-taking in conceptualizing boundaries as living tissue pays off through the rooted light lattice's irreversible transformation.</comment>
