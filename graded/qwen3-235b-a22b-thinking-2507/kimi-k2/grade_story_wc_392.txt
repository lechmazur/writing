<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "watchfully calm" vs throat tightening at scars; micro-choices like counting seconds under memory entanglement prove embodied conflict. Father's journal revelation earns the climactic stance shift with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: "He didn't die by accident. He died to protect the path" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—drip-to-heartbeat escalation reweights the dominant stake (truth vs data) through sensory pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tunnel functions as micro-setting that constrains every choice: lantern replaces flashlight, humidity preserves evidence, dripping water dictates rhythm. Scorch marks matching father's scars charge the final image—environment actively shapes the revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Maya's agency: tracing compass rose leads to journal discovery. Cost is legible in "He died to protect the path" realization, but drought's pressure (pumps enabling access) could be more actively felt during the climb toward surface.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "lantern left burning" as signal reweights "preventable deaths" without moralizing. Final line’s "fortified vulnerability" offers resonant answer to central question—resistance woven from grief—avoiding abstract sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: "mineral deposits shaped like fingerprints," "drip in Morse code" filter world through investigator’s trained eye. Rhythmic control under pressure ("drip became a heartbeat") avoids uniformity while sustaining tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "Empirical observation began/demanded" repetition is pattern-taught for thematic contrast. Minor cadence dip in "counting seconds" sentence slightly blurs immediacy, but propulsion remains relentless toward closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms historical mystery tropes through specific, grounded details: North Star etching on lantern, 32-degree compass deviation. Emotional truth in "interwoven" grief/purpose feels earned, not template-driven.</comment>
