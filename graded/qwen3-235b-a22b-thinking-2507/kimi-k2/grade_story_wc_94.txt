<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority rich but lacks contradictory impulses in action; "furiously tranquil" hands reveal tension yet final smile lacks visible cost escalation despite strong embodied emotion in darkroom sequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (scars as luminous constellations); Accumulative lens holds but "vigil in pause" deepening lacks causal pressure on tactics, slightly muddying escalation coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Darkroom timer and bus timetable function as micro-settings that constrain choices (routes as stitches, backward-ticking seconds); final image charges scars-as-roads motif with undeniable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through poet's agency (rarefying "rain" fragment), but escalation leans on atmospheric pressure rather than protagonist-driven trade-offs; conceptual cost (words rarefied into atmosphere) legible yet passive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "scars are roads" realization reweighting premise; final line ("every wound is a door") resonates without moralizing, though "cartography" metaphor slightly over-explained in mid-scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lightning etched glass like signature no editor could erase") with rhythmic control, but "wind rearranged constellations into new alphabets" strains into mixed metaphor under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor density issues: "furiously tranquil" repeats without deepening; "scars on paper"/"scars on palms" borders paraphrase loop; "storm kissed the dome" edges toward cliché in final beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of censorship/darkroom/astronomy tropes; "rarefy" action transforms premise with emotional specificity, though observatory setting lacks transformative novelty beyond expected metaphor.</comment>
