<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak; embodied conflict ("iron taste of silence") and micro-choices (tracing stars with sextant) reveal struggle. Final renunciation ("I will carry the unwritten...") earns closure through prior causality, though grandmother's backstory slightly over-explains.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost ("creativity burst outward... each flake a word she would never have to force"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: auroral density intensifies until the sextant's reflection reconfigures options. Cost legible in "snowfall" replacing forced effort.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Aurora-lit archway and sextant constrain choices (e.g., instrument's shadow positioning) and charge the final image ("mirrors reflecting... tomorrow’s dawn"). Micro-setting functions as environment; frost/silence sensory hierarchy sharpens under creative pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freeing caged creativity) tightens via auroral intensification. Sextant's evolution from measuring tool to self-reflection device narrows options under Accumulative lens. Cost ("snowfall" replacing struggle) is unmistakable but slightly abstract; visceral cost anchored in physical release ("animal waking inside her ribs").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sextant/stardust particulars: "distance between fear and beginning" reweights creativity without moralizing. Final image ("first faint lines of tomorrow’s dawn") offers resonant answer to "unmade art" conflict. Avoids thematic echo despite poetic density.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("breath crystallizing into small ghosts") remains consistent under stress. Rhythmic control shifts from lyrical accumulation ("wounds in the sky that never healed") to sparse urgency ("luminous, perilous, unfinished"). Zero head-hopping; compression taught early via fragmented reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "copper and snow" achieves textural specificity. Final beat ("footprints filling with green light") avoids overwriting despite high density. Minor risk: "wounded bird refusing to fly" slightly strains metaphor but payoff justifies it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "creative block" trope via sextant’s physicality and stardust as "living script." Emotional specificity ("stardust humming forgotten names") avoids generality. Risk-taking (lyric compression) heightens stakes without obscurity, though archway lore edges toward familiar mysticism.</comment>
