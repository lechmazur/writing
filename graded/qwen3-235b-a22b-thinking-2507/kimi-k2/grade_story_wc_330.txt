<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied action (singing as swallowed joy made sound), but internal contradiction lacks depth; passivity in early beats weakens agency despite earned transformation. Flawed silence-as-vow motivation is consistent yet under-tested before the halo's intervention.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully: "silence had never been absence, only canvas" reweights the entire premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens held flawlessly as sensory density escalates toward the train's motion, with the carpenter's vocal vulnerability as the persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Abandoned circus train functions as micro-setting that charges closure: the carousel's brass poles and canvas rebirth directly constrain the carpenter's singing choices. Frost-glittered tracks and halo fragment's physicality create tactile pressure impossible to ignore in the final motion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through the carpenter's singing agency under accumulative lens, with visible cost in his past silence (fists jammed pockets). Escalation succeeds via density shifts—cracked plates sealing, lions stepping out—but secondary stake (restoring joy) lacks sufficient friction against his core flaw.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the carpenter's actions: "interpret hush as invitation" crystallizes in the final echo without moralizing. The halo's transformation from fragment to dawn-coated rails reweights silence as possibility through concrete rebirth, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bright as unstruck matches," "iron snow") sustains voice under pressure, though slight register drift occurs in "ribbon of vowels." Rhythmic control excels in sensory compression during the singing sequence, teaching pattern early with wind bell chimes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion falters in one high-pressure beat: "colors bled back into faded banners: crimson lions, cobalt horses, golden mermaids" risks cataloging. Otherwise, zero loops and crystalline final image ("single whispering gleam that said go") maintain momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silent artist trope through circus-specific imagery (carousel carpentry, wind bell chimes) avoids cliché. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes, though the halo fragment's magic lacks full integration with the carpenter's established skills.</comment>
