<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marisol's contradictory impulses (shrewd broker vs. emotional daughter) drive micro-choices like reading the letter aloud and proposing the pact. The final declaration to continue the cycle earns closure through her mother's legacy, with embodied cost in "tears salted her lips" avoiding diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the locket's return crystallizes "compassion looping like currents" with undeniable emotional cost. Accumulative lens holds through envelope repetitions, and the storm-threatened symphony tightening reweights stakes without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The locket photo constrains choices across beats (worn, lost, returned) and charges the final image when pinned anew. Library micro-setting alters tactics via cocoa scent drawing dockhands, with star-drunk breeze consistently filtering perception through maritime urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens deepens the dominant stake (anonymous kindness) through Marisol's agency: envelope mistake → pact → community growth. Cost is unmistakable in her shattered composure and the locket's return, reweighting the cycle as "inward" homecoming.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through actions (envelopes as stowaway kindnesses), not statement. Final image—"tide returns what it borrows" with restored locket—offers resonant, non-literal answer to compassion's cyclical nature, avoiding sentimentality while charging prior motifs with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV maintains distinct perceptual signature ("ledger at dusk," locket warmth against skin) with rhythmic control under pressure. Theo's whimsical bow and Marta's weeping show voice distinction; syntax tightens to visceral fragments ("tears salted her lips") during emotional peaks without convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero closure artifacts: high density ("pressed edelweiss," "margins filled with doodles") with propulsion. Figurative language serves purpose (tide as kindness metaphor), avoiding overwriting. Final line’s ellipsis ("sail with...") creates visual rhythm without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms anonymous kindness trope through maritime specificity (cargo manifests, cleat-lost locket). Emotional truth in dockhands gathering for cocoa avoids generic uplift. Risk-taking with quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though middle-ground hedging slightly limits boldness.</comment>
