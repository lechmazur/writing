<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's embodied emotion ("ribs rang like bells") and micro-choices (planting seeds in question-mark hollow) reveal authentic contradiction, but motivation lacks friction—no struggle against "before memory fades" pressure during pivotal mirror scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the dissolving mirror crystallizes cost ("weight of every beautiful thing") under Accumulative lens, reconfiguring "missing pieces" with undeniable conceptual weight while honoring the refrain's promise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crater glass functions as essential micro-setting—constraining planting tactics via hollow shapes and charging the final image (pockets full of glass)—though spatial vagueness during seed-planting slightly undermines choreography coherence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen texturally through seed revelations, but "before memory fades" lacks live-clock pressure; the time constraint never alters Lira's tactics during the planting sequence, missing escalation opportunity under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The final image ("three-note chord humming beneath the world") reweights the premise without moralizing, transforming "why paths disappear" into a resonant answer about crystallized emotions carried by the bird—pure earned subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("glass transliterated wonder into her chest"), with rhythmic control during seed scenes; slight register drift in "transliterates" label mid-crisis barely dents otherwise flawless pressure modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops in peak beats, but "cheerful gloom" repetition in final paragraph (5x) creates scaffold clutter; high density persists ("vine of light spelling 'why'"), though minor overwriting dilutes closure's cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes memory tropes through crystalline physics—crater glass as emotion-translating shards feels inevitable—yet "before memory fades" refrain lacks sufficient transformation from common temporal motifs to reach 9.5+.</comment>
