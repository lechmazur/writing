<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority crystallizes through embodied micro-choices: tracing chalk numbers with "subtle indentations" and pressing the warm square reveal contradictory impulses (caution vs discovery) without diagnostic labels. Final choice to chart the island earns closure through prior causality, though Captain Rens' off-page presence limits relationship-as-crucible depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands decisively: "stranded luminance" transforms from metaphorical glow to charted coordinates with visible cost ("Captain Rens would scold"). Orientation anchors ship/chartroom by word 40. Accumulative lens holds through spiral pattern escalation, though the phrasebook's spontaneous glow slightly strains causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The antique airship functions as micro-setting: porthole moonlight enables the lens refraction, and cargo hold dust motes constrain Liora's tactile discovery. "Sociable isolation" modulates from chartroom calm to urgent plotting, charging the final image. Caps at 8.9 as environment shapes tactics but doesn't reconfigure the final stance beyond expectation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (curiosity vs caution) tightens through protagonist agency: ignoring Captain Rens' warning to press the hopscotch square escalates pressure texturally via accumulating spirals. Cost is unmistakable in crew disapproval and implied command breach. The starlings' steering role slightly edges toward coincidence but serves the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "stranded luminance" evolves from phrasebook metaphor to charted coordinates, with the final whisper ("become the map it follows home") reweighting prior material as earned wisdom. Avoids moralizing through Liora's tactile discovery process and the island's physical reality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "measured cloud shadows against coastline shadows" and brass spyglass details. Rhythmic control modulates from lyrical ("starling murmurations braided the dusk") to urgent ("heart hammered with thrill of first sight"). Slight repetition of "sociable isolation" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density: "sepia ink" conveys age and color, "dust motes drifted like miniature galaxies" compresses setting and theme. Final paragraph avoids overwriting despite high stakes. Minor deduction for "stranded luminance" near-repetition in Liora's mental state, risking conceptual redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms mapmaking tropes through "stranded luminance" physics and hopscotch-grid coordinates. Emotional specificity avoids template curiosity via tactile details (wood grain warmth, graphite notes). Caps at 8.9 as the starling guidance slightly echoes familiar murmuration motifs without sufficient transformation.</comment>
