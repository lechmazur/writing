<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("screaming tenderness") and embodied emotion (scent-memory triggers) feel authentic under pressure; micro-choices like palm-on-stone and vial uncorking reveal value hierarchy with visible cost in collapse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost ("Mara collapsed... spent but certain" + dissolving cork); Accumulative/Textural lens holds as scent/vibration density reweights "whispers vs shouts" with conceptual cost in final humming glass.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cobalt lighthouse functions as micro-setting constraint: stone tremor guides Mara's actions, lens contact enables climax, and final humming glass directly charges closure by altering village behavior.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mara's agency—whisper escalates to scream when vibration "demanded more"—with felt cost in physical/spiritual expenditure; dissolving cork makes tradeoff tangible though "spent" slightly softens consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through scent mechanics: final image ("glass in the village sing") reweights "whispers travel farther" by proving screaming tenderness *is* the purer whisper, avoiding moralizing while charging prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines via scent-based noticing ("ozone and copper that tasted like screaming tenderness"); rhythmic compression during scream ("tenderness so fierce it had to be screamed") heightens pressure without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-zero loops but slight register drift in "tasted like screaming tenderness" (metaphor overextension); filter verbs ("felt the intentions... shift") cluster in climax, dulling immediacy without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse trope via scent/vibration mechanics; "screaming tenderness" synthesizes emotional truth with fresh physics, making universal stakes specific through garden-scent logic that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
