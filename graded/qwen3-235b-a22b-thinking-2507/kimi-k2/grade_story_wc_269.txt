<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion ("fingertip remembered ghost-white reef") and micro-choices under pressure, but final descent lacks contradictory impulses—hesitation feels perfunctory rather than earned internal conflict during the pivotal choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost ("anchored to both sky and abyss"), fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens through density shift at the spiral descent; orientation flawless within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Station’s hollow legs and unsounded tide gauge actively constrain choices (tapping ritual, sensor failure), with the atlas page charging the final image; "periodically eternal" rhythm permeates both setting and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mara’s ritual deepening under Accumulative lens—tapping evolves from habit to permission-seeking, with visible cost in her transformation from data-keeper to witness who "logs no data".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through particulars: "silver thread" ships and restored reef offer resonant, non-literal answer to "paths disappear" without moralizing; the voice’s tapped revelation avoids thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bioluminescent plankton lit seams like solder") with rhythmic control under pressure; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure’s strategic ellipsis ("filed no").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("windless night folded around her... plankton lit seams like solder" does triple duty); only minor overwriting in "moment periodically eternal" prevents 10.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "ocean mystery" trope through specific marine science (sextant, tide gauge) and "folded paths" conceit; risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
