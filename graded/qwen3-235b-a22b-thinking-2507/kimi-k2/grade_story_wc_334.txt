<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "chronically curious" trait driving both recovery and vulnerability; embodied emotion ("voice cracking like ice") and micro-choices (shard arrangement) reveal hierarchy of values. Lacks fully simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak memory-recovery beat to reach 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost ("heavier now, freighted with crisp nostalgia") under Accumulative lens. Textural escalation through shard revelations reweights stakes, persistent curiosity-debt constraint shapes final image. Orientation anchored by "decades later" at 70 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Greenhouse ribs actively constrain choices (supplying sap for ledger), shipwrecks evolve from setting to resource. Final image ("apple that had finally learned how to rot") recharges prior unrotting premise with earned cost, fulfilling 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Textural deepening drives escalation as shards yield specific memories, narrowing Elara's options until the heart-shaped shard's revelation. Cost ("heavier now") unmistakable on page; curiosity trait creates authentic tension between want (recovery) and fear (painful truths).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "debts paid in curiosity" and rotting apple reconfigure folklore's gentle promise. Final image offers non-literal answer to memory trade-offs without moralizing; complexity lingers in "seasoned by absence" and unresolved shipwreck mysteries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature as folklorist ("fracture pattern" focus) and rhythmic control under pressure exceptional. Sentence cadence shifts from clinical ("arranging by fracture pattern") to visceral ("root loosened, releasing silver motes") without voice drift. Patterned elision taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "Orion’s belt snapped into three unequal lengths" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Figurative language remains coherent under pressure ("mushroom pulsed, and she understood it was the ledger"). Final line crystallizes theme with textural specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms folklore tropes through specific logic: shipwrecks as orchard roots, constellations as frozen sky. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off with "crisp nostalgia" modulating throughout. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight through lived detail.</comment>
