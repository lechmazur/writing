<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila’s "orderly intuitive" trait manifests concretely in tracing hidden grids amid chaos, with embodied contradiction ("hopeful desperation" turning to defiance). Tomasso’s "knife held by both edges" crystallizes dual allegiance under pressure, though his role edges functional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: buyers halted by "PROPERTY OF MEMORY" with visible cost (retreat), while drums shift to "defiant brass." Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via pattern breaks reweighting stakes; orientation anchors instantly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting (foundation stone chip) constrains every choice—from testing paint lines to final lantern—while the Whale’s ribs (ex-basilica struts) charge the closure image. Sensory details reflect urgency without checklist cadence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Lila’s agency: reorganizing hull narrows corporate options to "back to their own boats." Cost is unmistakable in buyers’ hesitation and Tomasso’s "knife" warning, deepening under Accumulative lens via pattern breaks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "reorganize the city’s skin" becomes tactical resistance. Final image ("bid on the last dream") reweights gentrification without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo via Lila’s barker voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("culture shock absorber trained in three continents") shapes selective detail (binary manes, hexadecimal mermaids). Rhythm modulates perfectly from lyrical opener to urgent rope-ladder climbs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; density multiplies meaning ("arrows that became fish, fish that dissolved into musical notation"). Figurative language ("hopeful desperation turned into defiant brass") propels without muddle, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms gentrification trope via specific logic: graffiti encoding hex/Morse, stone chip as compass. "Dual allegiance" synthesis feels inevitable, with risk-taking (Charged Poise closure) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
