<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction weak; Mara’s euthanasia motivation lacks embodied struggle against her "fold in patience" realization. Diagnostic label-speak ("gripped reality loosely") triggers -0.4 penalty without sufficient physical cost. Micro-choices lack hierarchy—accepting the old woman’s directive feels unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with felt cost ("Your work is to stay"), but escalation lacks agency under Accumulative lens. The storm’s arrival feels coincidental, not pressure narrowed by Mara’s choices. Cost proof is clear in "folded her patience once more" foreclosing her euthanasia path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina functions as essential micro-setting: ice’s "language of pressure" directly constrains Mara’s listening choice, and parasol’s lace casts "net of shadows" charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy flawlessly reflects her urgency—storm sequence narrows to tactile ice sounds.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (endings as companions vs. destinations) signaled early but escalation lacks meaningful tightening. Mara’s pivotal choice to stay stems from the old woman’s intervention, not her agency. Stakes feel abstract until droplets’ "tiny notes" crystallize cost, but trade-offs remain underdramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: parasol tip hearing "chord progression" of endings reweights the euthanasia premise without moralizing. Final image ("endings were not destinations but companions") offers resonant, non-literal answer. Avoids thematic echo—old woman’s dialogue implies rather than states the thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("wind carried smell of salt... like windborne solace"), but stress degrades unrealistically—Mara’s poetic syntax persists during storm without compression. Focalization stays tight, yet "gripped reality loosely" lacks character-particular idiom, verging on abstract diagnosis under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "droplets clung to the lace, shimmering with reflection of emergency lights" does triple duty (image, sound, theme). Minor scaffolding in "Mara’s mind still gripped reality loosely" semicolon clause risks abstraction. Zero closure artifacts; final line’s "broken mast" crystallizes earned action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms euthanasia tourism through specific, grounded choices: lace parasol tip hearing ice calvings avoids sentimentality. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over plot) heightens stakes—Mara’s listening redefines "ending" without gimmickry. Emotional truth anchors universals in verifiable details like "sealskin coat flaring like a sail".</comment>
