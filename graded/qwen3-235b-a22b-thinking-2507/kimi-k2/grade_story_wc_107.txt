<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (abandonment vs staying) embodied through glassblower's tactile perception; final choice earned by prior causality (bookmark history, thawing rhythm) with felt cost in "wet and gleaming" heart. Slight abstraction in "wanderers" motivation prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "heart sliding free... ready to be shaped" reconfigures abandonment through visceral glassblowing metaphor. Accumulative lens holds via sensory density (dripping ice → softening bookmark) with no causality breaks. Single deepening sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Abandoned control room functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (duct-coaxing, false panel discovery) and directly charges final image ("wet and gleaming" heart mirrors ice retreat). Bookmark's physical transformation (cracked → smile lines) shapes pivotal tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (crafting safe zones for inquiry) tightens through map discovery, deepening agency from seeking to building. Cost legible in embodied thawing ("tears turning to steam") and abandonment reversal. Pressure accumulates via temperature rise without coincidence, though secondary stake integration could be sharper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete actions (bookmark as placeholder, maps as molds), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "abandonment" as intentional leaving with conceptual cost. Glassblower lens prevents abstraction; no thematic echo despite "measure the human heart" line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (glassblower noticing translucence, molds) with rhythmic control: short sentences during duct-coaxing ("She unscrewed... coaxed... narrating") mirror stress. Tone modulates from contemplative to determined without POV drift. "Weighty lightness" motif sustains coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density where "drip... small bell announcing end of long freeze" establishes time/sound/theme. Final line's "wet and gleaming and ready to be shaped" crystallizes closure. Minor register risk in "pressure of unshed tears turning to steam" prevents 9.7+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms abandonment trope through glassblowing lens ("safe zones" as conceptual shelter). "Thawing heart" gains specificity via "molten glass" simile. Bold quiet closure pays off accumulation without gimmickry; fresh inflection in cartographer's legacy reweighted as "mold for possibility".</comment>
