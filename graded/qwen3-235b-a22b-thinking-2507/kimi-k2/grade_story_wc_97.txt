<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("strategically creative" revisionism vs. acceptance) embodied through film-reel actions; micro-choices like catching compasses reveal hierarchy of values with cost (clock explosion). Final smile earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("horizon agreed to postpone night indefinitely") with undeniable conceptual cost (clock exploding into lily). Accumulative lens holds perfectly; cost proof in "springs coiling into lily that opened/closed with each chord" reweights time.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tidal arbor's silver leaves and broken clock constrain choices (rewinding film, modulating music) and charge final image (lily-clock blooming on bough). Sensory hierarchy reflects pianist's urgency: "sea-smell though no ocean" mirrors emotional dislocation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by pianist's agency (threading film, stealing frame) under Accumulative lens; cost legible when clock "exploded quietly" as he rewrites departure. Horizon's "indigo blade" tightening stakes fulfills band guardrails for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "unplanned encore" reweights "promised music every sunset" without moralizing. Final image ("horizon postpone night indefinitely") offers resonant answer to "surprise fate" with conceptual cost (time inverted).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: musician's synesthetic diction ("steely longing alloyed with brassy defiance"). Rhythmic control peaks in "rewinding the quarrel, planting unplayed sonata" – compression taught early pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; "flickering compasses—thin sheets of glass etched with trembling needles" demonstrates high density. No figurative muddle: "horizon leaned close, a blade of indigo" sustains physical logic while charging stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: film-reel time travel transformed through musical stakes ("rewriting departure into return"). Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens coherence; "monochrome dress blooming into color" avoids cliché via specificity.</comment>
