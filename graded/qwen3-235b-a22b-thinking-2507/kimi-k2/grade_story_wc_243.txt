<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation for preserving covenant through ink is embodied in micro-choices (petal-pressing, tremor notation), with contradictory impulses (methodical recording vs. emotional dissolution) driving the final stay. Interiority avoids labels via sensory anchors like "taste of haunted euphoria," though mother's backstory lacks friction beyond photo motif.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost in "weight of water—impossible to hold, necessary to carry," crystallizing the covenant's preservation through the locket's transformation. Accumulative lens holds throughout as jetty dissolution tightens pressure, though orientation at 120 words relies on poetic cues rather than concrete anchors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The blooming jetty actively constrains choices as boards dissolve into water, with recurring locket and ink vials charging the final image (mirror reflection, vial clinks). Sensory specificity ("gull’s voice cracking like old glass") avoids cliché, though "haunted euphoria" leans toward abstract motif without deeper physical grounding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten as jetty dissolution forces accelerated documentation, with agency-driven escalation in her refusal to retreat despite thinning into "annotation." Cost is visceral in bodily transformation, though the covenant's abstract nature risks making stakes feel less immediate than the physical dissolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory's weight emerges through concrete particulars (petal on photo, ink merging with emulsion), with the final line reweighting "small moments" as both burden and necessity. Avoids moralizing, though "necessary to carry" edges toward slight thematic echo without full ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("air tasted like haunted euphoria," ink "looping like seaweed") modulates rhythm during dissolution with fragmented urgency. Minor register drift in "proximate causes" feels academic for archivist’s voice, slightly dulling immersion in peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with dual-purpose lines ("petal fell onto photograph, sticking to her mother’s smile like a tear") but paraphrase loop in "gently thorough" (para 2 and final paragraph) triggers -0.2. No closure-dulling artifacts, though "haunted euphoria" repetition risks thematic redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archivist mythology through tactile details (walnut tannin ink, 37-year cycle) avoids tropes, with emotional truth in mother-daughter legacy. Risk-taking in quiet closure earns +0.3, though "blooming jetty" slightly echoes magical realism conventions without full transformation.</comment>
