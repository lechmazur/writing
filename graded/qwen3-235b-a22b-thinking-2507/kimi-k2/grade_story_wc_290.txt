<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s claustrophobia is embodied through micro-choices (counting steps amid narrowing corridors) and visceral contradictions ("lungs tighten like fists" vs. weightless relief). Final fusion choice feels earned by mother’s ghost contact, though "wistful rebellion" risks sentimentality without deeper flaw exploration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: corridors widen and starlight pours in after compass fusion, with undeniable cost in mother’s fading ghost. Accumulative lens holds—spatial distortions (corridor sealing, spiral warping) tighten pressure until the resonant reconfiguration. Orientation anchored by line 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The nexus setting actively constrains choices: stone archways trigger claustrophobia, damp flagstones echo footsteps, and the organ’s spatial warping enables the climax. Final image of compass point etched in light on skin recharges the brass artifact’s meaning with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (claustrophobia vs. discovery) escalates through narrowing corridors and sealed retreat, culminating in the organ’s reverberation—a deepening that shifts spatial perception. Cost is legible in mother’s ghost fading post-contact, though "spatial mutiny as memory" slightly softens the tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: compass fusion reweights "wistful rebellion" as legacy continuity, not abstract defiance. Final image ("compass point glowing like a promise") resonates without moralizing, though "labyrinth exhaling" edges toward sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines: explorer’s spatial precision ("measured angles") and tactile awareness ("stone grinding like teeth"). Minor cliché ("lungs tighten like fists") and slight register drift in "spatial mutiny" prevent 9.0, but rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via concrete verbs ("grinding," "rippled," "unhooked"). "Lungs tightening like fists" is a stock simile, and "ghostly cartographers suspended" slightly abstracts, but no figurative muddle in peak beats. Final line’s "glowing like a promise" risks sentimentality yet stays earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms exploration tropes via spatial mechanics: "spatial mutiny as memory" and organ reverberation as warping force feel fresh. Compass point’s evolution (brass tool → star-chart etching) synthesizes legacy with bold physics. Avoids safety middle through conceptual specificity.</comment>
