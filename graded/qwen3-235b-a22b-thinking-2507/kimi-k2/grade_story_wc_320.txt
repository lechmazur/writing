<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in discarding assumptions while seeking fixed beginnings; micro-choices (tuning by shedding beliefs) embody grief’s paradox without therapy-speak. Mother’s "hello" reversal earns closure through prior causality, but lunar perigee’s pressure lacks physical manifestation in Kael’s struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (sphere’s vibration, chalked message) reconfigures endings with conceptual cost (grief hollow filled), but lunar perigee timing isn’t leveraged as active pressure—moonlight retreat feels passive rather than narrowing options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Abandoned towers function as micro-setting: corroded turntable constrains the tuning action, and "serenely electric hum" charging the final image ("serenely electric in moonlight") fulfills 9+ gate. Moonlight thread literally lifts the shard, making environment causally active.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hearing mother’s true ending) tightens through discarding assumptions, but escalation lacks visible cost beyond emotional resonance—the gorge swallowing moonlight is atmospheric, not a traded resource or altered tactic under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through shard/star fusion reweighting "beginnings as echoes," avoiding moralizing. "Every ending is a tuning fork" risks thematic echo but is Kael’s earned action, not narration; mother’s looping "hello" offers non-literal answer to grief’s question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "flecks of gold paint drifted like fireflies before dissolving into the hush"—sensory blending reflects Kael’s tuning mindset. Rhythmic control peaks in "rewinding laughter, arguments, bedtime stories" under emotional pressure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "liquid light pooled around the shard of hush" exemplifies high-density imagery. "Serenely electric" repetition risks overwriting but gains cohesion through closure linkage ("serenely electric in moonlight"), avoiding figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio tower physics with grief-as-frequency transforms tropes; "discarding assumptions" as tuning method feels inevitable. Lunar perigee’s underutilization as active pressure slightly dilutes risk, but chalked message elevates closure beyond familiar endings.</comment>
