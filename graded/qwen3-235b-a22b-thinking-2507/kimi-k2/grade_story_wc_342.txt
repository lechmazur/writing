<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lira's blindness isn't a gimmick but the engine of her artistry; her realization that she's painting "not strangers but the guild members themselves" crystallizes internal contradiction through embodied action rather than abstract epiphany, avoiding diagnostic label-speak while showing genuine struggle under demolition pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: the building's physical destruction ("folds inward like a closing book") transforms into "seeds of light sown among the ruins," reweighting knowledge preservation under the Accumulative/Textural lens; the coin's warmth against her palm makes the cost visceral as the hydraulic claw bites.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The tree trunk library actively constrains choices (concave wall painting, demolition deadline) and charges the final image—splintered shards becoming "seeds of light"—fulfilling the 9+ gate requirement where setting isn't backdrop but the very mechanism of thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Demolition pressure tightens through sensory escalation ("floodlights probe... like predatory eyes" to "first beam crashes"), narrowing Lira's time while her agency deepens via painting choices; the cost—physical library loss transformed into conceptual rebirth—is unmistakable in the "motes that drift upward, each mote a page."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ending's "shards carry a fragment of the mural" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to knowledge preservation without moralizing, emerging from concrete particulars (coin indentations, fractal stars) rather than abstraction; thematic complexity embraces loss ("indifferent" sky) without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in stress-distorted focus ("Time narrows; the demolition crew’s floodlights... predatory eyes"), with rhythmic compression teaching its pattern early ("bark breathing with centuries of ink") and paying off in the closure's "silence so complete," avoiding any register drift or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; high-density prose ("stars blooming like frost") propels momentum while serving accumulative pressure, though one near-overwritten beat ("limit of pigment to hold light") risks slight dilution in a high-stakes moment, preventing a 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synthesizes blindness and cosmic vision into fresh emotional truth—the "fractally precise" motif isn't quirky ornament but the story's structural principle, transforming library demolition into rebirth; avoids derivative tropes through specific, verifiable details like the coin's "scalloped" edges.</comment>
