<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in professional ritual ("painted lips," "geometries of grief") drives the pivotal hesitation. Contradictory impulses (surrender vs. turn back) manifest physically through the emerald chip's warmth and the threshold's pull, avoiding diagnostic labels. Micro-choice of pressing the chip earns closure via accumulated pattern recognition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the threshold collapsing into brilliance crystallizes options with visceral cost ("palms open, no emerald left"). Orientation anchors by word 40 ("skyborne grotto," aurora). Accumulative lens holds—pressure builds through density of memory-patterns, culminating in the final map image charging the cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Skyborne grotto constrains tactics (wind spirals for descent) and charges closure via the aurora dimming to "memory of color." The emerald chip functions as micro-setting: its physical weight ("no emerald left to weigh them down") shifts to intangible map, fulfilling 9+ gate by constraining the final choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: pressing the chip narrows options to cross/turn back, with the memory flood intensifying stakes. Cost is unmistakable in "palms open, no emerald left," reconfiguring the dominant stake (saving sparks) into the map's legacy. One tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "dotted freckles back in place" and "geometry of a final sigh" avoid abstraction. Final image ("map inside her like a lantern") offers non-literal answer to combating oblivion, resisting tidy morals while charging the childhood salon memory with earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: mortician notices "whorls in every palm" and "arc of a widow’s eyebrow." Rhythmic control peaks in "The pane rippled outward in concentric rings, each ring a lifetime"—compression mirrors pressure. No head-hopping; lyrical elision taught early via "spiral of wind" motif.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "faces bloomed and faded: the bride whose mascara..." achieves high density without muddle. Final line "mirrors fogged with hairspray" pays off childhood memory with precision. No figurative artifacts in peak beats—green fire imagery remains physically coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms death-industry tropes via "beautician mortician" specificity ("softened scar with concealer"). Emotional truth in "child whose freckles she had dotted back" avoids sentimentality. Risk-taking (lyric threshold as lens) heightens stakes coherently, passing transformation test—swap "emerald" for "sapphire" breaks the green fire motif's logic.</comment>
