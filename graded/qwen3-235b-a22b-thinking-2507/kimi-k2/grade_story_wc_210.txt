<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in rejecting "false comfort the way sea rejects a cracked shell," but the shift from despair to conception lacks visible struggle; micro-choices like recalling star-anise scent reveal values, yet the pivotal realization feels unearned without prior causal friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation debt: "who" (alchemist) anchors too late (~150 words), triggering -0.4 penalty. Closure succeeds as Charged Poise ("town inhale, subtle shift in pressure") with conceptual cost, but the Accumulative lens wobbles when conception veers near-Causal without sufficient pattern-teaching early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: the amber bottle constrains choices (warming against ribs during conception) and charges the final image (new lantern rising from spoken vision). Cove’s rotting pilings and salt wind aren’t backdrop—they pressure decisions like the apothecary memory recall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake crystallization is flawless: "comfort without wound is dying" tightens options as he conceives civilization, with visible cost (abandoning the bottle). Agency drives every escalation under Accumulative lens—laughter to aqueducts to governance blueprint—making the felt cost ("absence into space ready for presence") unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "true revival is conceived, not poured," avoiding moralizing. The final lantern rising reweights the cove’s silence without stating morals, while "grief stored in communal lanterns" embodies complexity—no false equivalence between wish-based death and conceived life.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tide against rotting pilings," "scent of crushed star-anise") and rhythmic control elevate conception’s cadence ("From that sound he built rhythm..."). Minor flaw: "sea rejects a cracked shell" slightly strains metaphor without full physical logic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "aqueducts woven from bamboo and silk, carrying not water but stories" achieves high density without muddle. Final line’s rhythm ("small, fierce smile of a builder") resolves with textural precision, though "alphabet-shaped rice" risks density overload in one beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms ghost-town tropes through alchemy-specific revival ("conceived, not poured"). Risk-taking in lyric accumulation (memory to civilization blueprint) heightens stakes coherently, with "books grew on trees" feeling inevitable in hindsight—a fresh synthesis avoiding derivative templates.</comment>
