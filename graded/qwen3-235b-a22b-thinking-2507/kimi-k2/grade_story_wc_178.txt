<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in mistrusting gifts yet trusting measurements; micro-choices like fasting to save oil concretely manifest frugality. Final renunciation of star-charts earns cost through prior causality, though hesitation breath lacks deeper contradictory impulse exploration for 9+ band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: signing covenant in dust crystallizes cosmic cost ("surrender star-charts... binding into perpetual dusk") under Accumulative lens. Pressure intensifies via sensory density (wind matching breath, ember-lit sconces), with Crooked Staff alignment providing decisive deepening that narrows options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Palace actively constrains choices (stepping where "weight of memory lightest"), while tile-as-tool fuses with basalt plug to charge final image. Lapis mosaics and basalt aren't decorative but functional mechanisms, satisfying 9+ gate through environmental pressure on tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cosmic certainty) tightens through Naram-Sin’s deepening devotion under Accumulative lens—fasting, realigning tile—culminating in irreversible forfeiture of star-charts. Cost is unmistakable in "cracked quartz lens, now useless," with agency driving every escalation beat toward covenant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (signing in charcoal dust) rather than abstraction; final image of Crooked Staff "burned steady, as if never lost" reweights premise without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo while embracing complexity—sacrificing personal glory for cosmic order feels earned, not balanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: astronomer’s precision ("charcoal ground from date pits," "moon slipped a degree") permeates syntax. Rhythmic control modulates from lyrical descriptions to urgent beats ("He hesitated only a breath"), with patterned elision (omitting second character) taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "columns hummed with low bronze of twilight" exemplifies textural specificity. Final line’s "Crooked Staff constellation burned steady" avoids figurative muddle while charging closure. Information density peaks in high-pressure beats without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astronomer-as-custodian trope through Babylonian specificity and "encrypted devotion" concept. Emotional truth in surrendering star-charts elevates beyond surface novelty, though emotional complexity could deepen further for 9+ band despite strong risk-taking in Accumulative structure.</comment>
