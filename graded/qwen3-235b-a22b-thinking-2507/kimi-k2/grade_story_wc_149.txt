<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction weak; ghost bride’s motivation clear but lacks simultaneous conflicting impulses beyond stated debt/love. Final choice earned yet micro-choices under pressure (e.g., touch leaving frost) insufficiently reveal value hierarchy. "Lovingly venomous" poison backstory told, not embodied in present action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with visible cost (vanishing, dawn cracking night) under Accumulative/Textural lens. However, causality thin: bead pressing lacks escalation beyond atmospheric density; "resonant awakenings" mechanism unexplained, risking soft reset. Orientation clear by 80 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Greenhouse constrains every choice: fruit’s light dictates movement, soot-blackened glass shapes the dawn’s impact. "Ashen veil" and "carved stone bead" function as micro-settings charging the final image. Sensory details (frost on fruit, winter-cracked fields) evolve causally with the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repaying debt) tightens via bead-fruit contact, narrowing options to one decisive act. Cost legible in vanishing and dawn’s arrival. Agency driven by ghost bride’s choice, but escalation relies on atmospheric deepening rather than protagonist-caused pressure shifts under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "ashen veil" (broken promises) and bead dissolution (debt as love transcending betrayal). Final snowflakes carrying love fragments reweight prior material without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality via concrete images (ordinary fruit, clear glass), though "resonant awakenings" borders on abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "voice like wind through dead leaves," "luminescence the only light." Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity (e.g., short clauses during bead dissolution). Purposeful repetition of "ephemeral cameo" taught early and paid off in closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; "winter-cracked fields" reprise charges closure. High density: "fruit that glowed like captive stars" advances setting/theme. Minor register drift in "resonant awakenings" (slightly academic) but redeemed by contextual integration. Final line’s "humming with resonant awakenings" avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms ghost bride trope via alchemical specificity (silver-leafed trees, stone bead symbols). Emotional truth in "mournful elation" avoids generic romance. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off; snowflakes carrying love fragments feel inevitable, not quirky. No derivative premise echoes.</comment>
