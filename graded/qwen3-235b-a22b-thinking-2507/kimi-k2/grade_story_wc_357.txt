<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown through micro-choices (e.g., pocketing arrow while sensing danger), but "memories not hers" vision lacks embodied degradation under stress; epiphany feels slightly unearned despite strong action alignment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: gravity's return creates visible cost (crushing risk), echoes merging reconfigures stakes, and "endure" crystallizes resilience with conceptual cost; lens holds as Accumulative/Textural.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Floating arches and inverted rivers actively constrain choices (glider navigation, time pressure), while silverleaf spores charge the final image; environment shapes tactics throughout and elevates closure with embedded metal flecks.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully via gravity inversion's countdown, forcing Kael's final choice; cost is visceral (crushing risk) and conceptual (echoes merging), but escalation relies slightly on atmospheric pressure over protagonist-driven agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from arrow-tip motif: resilience as memorialized courage avoids moralizing; "endure" offers non-literal answer to central question, though thematic weight leans heavily on final image without sufficient mid-story friction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in gravity-flip details ("water flow reversed into spiraling vortex"); rhythmic control under pressure flawless, with no head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "luminescent roots dangled like chandeliers" sequence; figurative language serves momentum without muddle; final line ("living map of courage") crystallizes theme with concrete propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ecological resilience and memorialized courage feels inevitable; bold inversion physics heightens stakes, but "singing arrows" trope slightly undermines originality despite strong contextual integration.</comment>
