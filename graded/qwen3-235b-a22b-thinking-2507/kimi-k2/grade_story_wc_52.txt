<question>1</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied in "afraid any knife stroke would release the roar" versus compressing absence; final pocketing of carving shows earned endurance with visible cost in "weight you can carry without bleeding." No diagnostic labels—grief manifests through thumb-presses and wood grain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: sun-ignited hollows crystallize options (carrying compressed love vs. frozen grief) with cost in "nights she woke reaching for a man no longer there." Accumulative lens holds as density builds toward "harvest of loss" under kettle countdown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight constrains choice—light guides hollows, chains sound like cages, kettle steam marks time. Final sun shaft on ash wood charges closure; environment isn't backdrop but active pressure shaping the carving’s transformation into "portable" memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten under kettle’s 90-second countdown: each "here, gone" press narrows options until the carving becomes "a small, closed mouth." Cost is visceral in "each hollow a lesson harvested from the nights she woke," driving Mara’s agency toward compressing loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through ash wood’s transformation: "love is not erased... made portable" reweights "rust-hued peace" from blood to nourishing leaves. Final image of pocketed carving offers resonant answer without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "raindrops slid like slow applause" and "chains swaying in the draft." Rhythm modulates with kettle’s urgency ("here, gone" refrain), voice stays within Mara’s lexicon—no head-hopping or register drift under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "crystallized time in miniature" and "tiny hollows like miniature spotlights" achieve high density without muddle. Final line’s "time crystallized into something she could finally hold" propels closure with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms widow trope via circus-specific ash wood method: compressing absence rather than carving presence. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes—"Stay wild" whisper feels inevitable through prior particulars, no gimmickry.</comment>
