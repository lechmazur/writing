<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("bleak exhilaration surged") manifests through micro-choices like rerunning perturbation models; embodied emotion in "lungs burning with thin air and revelation" avoids diagnostic labels while showing struggle under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost when the parallel wedding vision "sliced her open," reconfiguring options through "bleak exhilaration" as atmospheric pressure; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through refracted vow imagery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Geode constrains choices (calibrating interferometer with refractive index) and charges final image ("violet light across the deck" refracting vows), though "widowed moon" risks cliché; micro-setting drives closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Protagonist's agency tightens stakes via perturbation amplitude escalation, forcing trade-offs (time vs. unsanctioned grief) with visible cost in the "surgical" vision cut; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image of refracted vows offers non-literal answer to "where unused potential pools," reweighting the premise through "I do" whispered to empty air—earned resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "circuit breakers sighed" anthropomorphism; rhythmic control under pressure evident in fragmented "She laughed, a sound like ice fracturing," though "intangibly tangible" repetition borders on tic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-synonym loop ("shrapnel still lodged"/"scars beneath her skin") costs 0.2; otherwise high density with propulsion in "She opened the airlock hatch, geode clenched," avoiding figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantum physics and grief ("perturbation theory" as emotional calculus) transforms tropes; risk-taking heightens stakes through orbital burial of potential, though drone symbolism leans familiar.</comment>
