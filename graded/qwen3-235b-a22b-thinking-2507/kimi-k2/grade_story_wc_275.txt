<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority excels through embodied micro-choices (burying scrap, grafting cuttings) that reveal contradictory impulses: pacifism vs inherited violence. "Continuity was not loyalty" avoids stock phrasing but borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise RR lands with undeniable cost in the boy's "clutching the bloom" and cracked pane. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density shifts; the sap pulse crystallizes stakes without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sandbag soil constrains every choice—from burial ritual to scavenger's recognition—and charges the final image. "Geothermal heart" subtly mirrors Lila's resilience, avoiding overt symbolism while shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lila's agency: offering the rose reconfigures the scavenger threat into continuity. Cost is visceral in the boy's trembling hand, though escalation relies slightly on coincidence (his arrival).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sandbag reprise: "Grow the memory" becomes actionable via buried scrap, avoiding moralizing. Final sap pulse offers non-literal answer to "quiet grows" without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in stress-filtered details ("iron-blood scent of panic"). Rhythm modulates from fractured dawn to steady dome lights; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure's tactile immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "tranquil blaze" evolves organically across beats. High density in "canvas husks now slit open" avoids overwriting while charging momentum. Final sap pulse avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pacifist bounty-hunter trope through sandbag soil's tangible history. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes—no weapon drawn, only a rose—without gimmickry.</comment>
