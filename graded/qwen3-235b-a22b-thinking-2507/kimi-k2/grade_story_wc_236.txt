<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied micro-choices (feeling glass temperature as "blood-heat" while anosmic), but grandmother backstory edges toward convenient folklore rather than earned revelation during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "hearing the scent... with hollow beneath ribs" crystallizes irreversible sensory transformation with visible cost in "air she could almost smell," holding Accumulative/Textural lens through density of refracted light and ticking screw.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Water clock's calcified copper veins directly constrain Elara's tactile translation method, charging the final image as "compass for emotional terrain," though occupational specificity lacks deeper mechanical constraints beyond surface-level tools.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's agency: placing the screw in the escapement reconfigures options, with cost legible in "almost smell" as permanent sensory trade-off, avoiding coincidence by making the screw's warmth an earned consequence of prior choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through the screw's evolution from "dried placenta" rust to ticking compass, avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights "ordinary miracles" through tangible cost without abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("translating temperature into vocabulary her nose abandoned") modulates rhythm under pressure, though "emotional terrain" phrasing briefly drifts toward abstraction before being redeemed by concrete action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fog pressed against pane, an occluded view that made wheel look like moon eclipsed by memory" achieves density without muddle, though "tasted like first light" slightly strains metaphor in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms anosmia trope through the birthing clamp screw's irreplaceable specificity—its rust-as-placenta texture becomes organic emotional compass, avoiding sentimentality with "ordinary miracle" grounded in skin-level sensation.</comment>
