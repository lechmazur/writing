<question>1</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Mapkeeper’s embodied contradiction—hoarding silence vs. learning resonance—drives every micro-choice (clenched fist, scored bridge line) with visceral cost in "tears froze on her lashes." No stock phrasing; her grief’s physicality anchors the epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: her incomplete maps rewritten as bridges, heartbeat becoming "the only drum." The Accumulative lens holds perfectly—pressure tightens via sensory density, not plot, culminating in the stone’s placement that reconfigures silence’s meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Harmonic caves constrain every choice: ice fractures guide her realization, luminous walls reflect her transformation. The echo chamber stone (tool) charges the final image—floating on black water—making environment indispensable to closure’s resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through the mapkeeper’s agency: "I need the quiet in the storm" reframes silence as active resonance. Escalation via Accumulative lens—each deepening hush (stone’s pulse, frozen tears) reweights the dominant stake until her heartbeat becomes the universe’s drum.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "silence was not absence but resonance" reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image—the scored bridge line—offers non-literal answer to "quiet in the storm," charging prior material with conceptual cost of incomplete maps.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: "fractures branched like the map on her skin" filters ice through her obsession. Rhythm modulates with pressure—lyrical cadence tightens during the being’s approach, then breathes in closure. Zero head-hopping; voice stays embodied in her sensory reality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "hammered repose" deepens meaning across beats without muddle. One near-miss: "storm of light and sound" risks cliché, but "ears ringing even in silence" recontextualizes it. Final line’s fragmentation ("it") serves Charged Poise without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms "energy beings" trope via specific resonance physics: silence as "balance," not absence. Emotional truth in hoarding grief as "stolen quiet." Fresh inflection—tears freezing as "crystals catching light"—avoids sentimentality by charging closure’s conceptual cost.</comment>
