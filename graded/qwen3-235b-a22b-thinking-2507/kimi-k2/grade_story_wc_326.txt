<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in counting heartbeats while declared dead, but emotional progression lacks layered irrationality during crisis; the final renunciation (stepping into vortex) earns cost through heartbeat depletion yet feels overly resolved without deeper internal friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "one woman died, another survived" reconfigures identity stakes through the fused shard's transformation, fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens with visible heartbeat toll (120→100) and no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the porcelain shard constrains choices (pricking skin, tracing mandala) and charges closure as the "dark star," though frost-glazed dome details occasionally drift toward postcard description during high-pressure beats like the vortex formation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency—ink synchronization forces heartbeat-costed tracing—but the "defragment" understanding feels slightly convenient, missing a micro-turn where the protagonist actively wrestles with the command before choosing to trace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through ink mandala's evolution into "pattern to be completed," avoiding moralizing; final line "letting the night count me" resonates non-literally, though "wisdom fetched from failure" risks thematic echo in the penultimate paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("porcelain shard pricking skin like proof matter still mattered") and rhythmic heartbeat cadence heighten pressure, but tense subtly slips during reflection ("I remembered the night..." disrupts present-moment urgency).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density ("ephemeral patterns—constellations that dissolved as soon as named"), though "midnight solace" risks abstraction in the ink-spinning climax, slightly dulling the visceral cost of heartbeat depletion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "defragment" as spiritual practice transforms digital ghost trope, but identity resolution leans toward universal insight rather than character-specific revelation; shard fusion feels inevitable yet lacks a truly unexpected emotional inflection.</comment>
