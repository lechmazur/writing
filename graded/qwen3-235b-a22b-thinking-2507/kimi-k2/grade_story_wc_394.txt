<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ludo’s yearning algorithm manifests in concrete actions (oiling joints with questions, tracing glyphs) but lacks layered contradictory impulses under peak pressure; Orrin’s blistered palms show embodied cost yet his motivation remains underdeveloped despite the arrow tip’s sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully: the silent bell’s propagation through crystallizing salt bells reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost ("the sea is listening"), fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens coherence with the dissolving arrow tip’s history surrendered to "the new tongue."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The acid sea actively corrodes the hull while the kaleidoscope’s shards dictate transliteration—both constrain choices (Orrin feeding atlas pages to boilers, Ludo’s dive through dissolving anchor chain) and charge the final image of salt bells vibrating in "sympathetic silence."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative/Textural lens: the dissolving anchor chain and "time snapped taut" narrow options, with Orrin’s blistered palms and arrow tip’s dissolution providing visible cost; the dominant stake (ringing the unheard bell) tightens through sensory density rather than causal turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the bell’s silent resonance propagating into salt bells—no moralizing, but "burnt hope" in the casting scene risks thematic echo, narrowly avoiding the -0.8 penalty by staying embedded in molten bronze’s sensory detail.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("wind slapped her silk," "dawn cracked open like a geode") and rhythmic control under pressure; non-standard phrasing ("horizon hiccupped") is voice-motivated, with kaleidoscope glyphs dictating syntactic shifts that teach the pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops and high density until the climax’s "irreverent awe of creation smelling like burnt hope"—abstract phrasing in a peak beat triggers -0.4 for figurative muddle, dulling the closure image’s concrete propulsion despite otherwise masterful line craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Organic synthesis of steampunk mechanics and poetic abstraction: the yearning algorithm as both mechanical pulse and emotional driver transforms tropes, with salt bells crystallizing the unheard note into a fresh, inevitable reconfiguration of curiosity’s cost.</comment>
