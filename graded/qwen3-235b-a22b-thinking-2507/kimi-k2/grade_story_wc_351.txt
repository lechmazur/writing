<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; motivation ("archeologist of abandoned dreams") is told not dramatized early. Diagnostic label-speak ("synaptic plasticity") in peak beats without embodied struggle weakens causality of her surrender.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands cleanly with cost: "cracks were not flaws but maps" reconfigures meaning. Accumulative lens holds, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven deepening—pressure builds through sensory density without narrowing options or trade-offs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Bioluminescent moss charges the final image but functions only as metaphor, not active constraint. Setting remains postcard-esque; canyon's generic moonlit quality doesn't shape tactics beyond ambiance, missing micro-setting gate for 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (excavating dreams) signaled early but pressure never tightens. No escalation: memories flow passively, canyon syncs without resistance. Cost is conceptual ("cracks as maps") but lacks visible price paid during the act itself.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme ("memory was not a vault but a garden") emerges through "cracks became windows" and light-trail footsteps. Final image avoids moralizing while reweighting abandonment as active tending, though near-echo "requiring constant tending" flirts with thematic statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("helix-minded," "chaotically precise") shines, but academic diction ("synaptic plasticity") intrudes during high-pressure mirror press. Rhythmic control salvages it, though peak-beat register drift risks voice contamination.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical but overwrites in climax: "liquid memory" (visual) clashes with "water finding channels" (tactile) in the same beat. Mixed metaphor muddles causality without payoff, though closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neuroscience and memory archaeology avoids cliché, but "archeologist of abandoned dreams" borders on stock phrasing. Final mirror-as-map image feels earned through prior specifics, though risk-taking stays within lyrical safety rails.</comment>
