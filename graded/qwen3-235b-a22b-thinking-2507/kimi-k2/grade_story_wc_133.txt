<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via painterly perception ("insomnia was never emptiness but a surplus of meaning"), but stranger’s motivation remains archetypal ("hunger more articulate than any face") without concrete pressure on Ishka’s choice, slightly undermining micro-choice depth at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: tide flooding island while "last night and next tomorrow sounded exactly the same" reconfigures time with conceptual cost (amber heat leaving skin reluctantly). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density without disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tidal island setting constrains every choice—low tide reveals brooch, rising tide forces exchange—and charges closure as dunes become ghosts. Basalt "wings" and painted glass shards actively pressure Ishka’s "thresh meaning" motivation with visceral specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency: Ishka’s choice to trade brooch for canvas narrows options (past connection vs. fragile hope), with visible cost in "amber heat left her skin reluctantly." Pressure accumulates via rain’s intensification without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: beetle in amber crawling "a single step" reweights time’s cyclical nature without moralizing. Final image answers "meaning from experience" via painted glass shards entering eyes "like slow sunrise," avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawlessly character-bound: Ishka sees "colors scream when squeezed too hard" and "sunlight wobbled like breath caught mid-sob." Voice modulates under pressure with rhythmic control ("rain began, thin needles her insomnia usually counted like rosary").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose dazzles with textural density ("vibrated with the hush-hush of converging timelines"), but stacked metaphors in climax ("colors bled, but not away; they entered her eyes like slow sunrise") risk muddling causality, narrowly avoiding Q7 penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms war-tale tropes via painter’s insomnia-as-surplus-meaning. The brooch/beetle/honey triad synthesizes memory, time, and loss into fresh emotional logic where "amber heat left her skin reluctantly" feels inevitable yet revelatory.</comment>
