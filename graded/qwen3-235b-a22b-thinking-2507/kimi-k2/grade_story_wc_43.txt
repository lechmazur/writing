<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority crystallizes through embodied hope ("mineral breath after rain on slate") and contradictory impulses; micro-choices (pressing shard to wrist, pulse-completion) reveal value hierarchy with felt cost. Slight elevation in "decisive kindness" redeemed by immediate action under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: vinyl circle "whole in its incompleteness" crystallizes stance with undeniable cost ("exhale indistinguishable from final hiss"). Accumulative lens holds—pressure tightens via pattern (trembling shards, scent intensifying), not causal turns; blood work timing serves atmospheric urgency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting (vinyl shard, oxygen machine) constrains choices: Mara must "hymn the mundane" using bedside objects. Final image (vinyl on windowsill) charged by scent "neither cloying nor sad," with sensory details filtered through therapist's bias ("groove caught skylight like secret smile").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by Mara's agency: pattern-deepening ("tapping footboard," "pitcher rim singing") reweights time-limited stake ("slip away before supper") with unmistakable cost (death as "final hiss"). No reversals needed; Accumulative lens executed flawlessly through object-driven pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: "reunification was not of vinyl but of life with its own vanishing." Ending reweights material through resonant image ("intact circle... whole in its incompleteness") without moralizing; subtext operates in Mrs. Eland's wordless "continue" and scent's evolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: notices "groove caught skylight like secret smile," measures shards by "weight." Rhythm modulates under pressure (staccato taps vs. sustained hum); lyrical compression ("Tuesday tasted like copper") taught early and paid in closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("scent of hope grew stronger, metallic and bright" does triple duty). Figurative language precise ("shimmer above quilt like heat above asphalt"); final line avoids muddle while recharging "sparrow’s wing" motif with earned finality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: hospice setting + vinyl fragmentation transforms "flawless goodbye" trope. Bold Accumulative structure succeeds because closure image charges prior material—imperfection as wholeness ("whole in its incompleteness") feels inevitable through lived-in details like "loose screw as muted bell".</comment>
