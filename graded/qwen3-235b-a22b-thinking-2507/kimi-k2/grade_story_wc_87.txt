<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied through physical actions (paddling "merrily melancholic" amid regret), micro-choices like counting utility poles as "rosary beads of regret," and no diagnostic labels. Final renunciation earned by tactile cost: "compass glass cut him" and "scar" traced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost: compass surrendered while "ache" in chest persists. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure tightens through sensory density ("barnacles like rasp of conscience") to reconfigure regret into "love with nowhere to go" without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Utility poles constrain navigation tactics and charge closure ("counting red flashes backward"). Astronomical compass cuts hand physically, making regret tangible. Bioluminescent gut forces narrow passage, directly shaping the climax’s choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early: "backlash of regrets not a storm to outrun but a current to ride." Escalation driven by protagonist’s surrender (following silhouette), narrowing options as fog swallows lights. Cost legible in "cracked hand" and surrendered compass.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: "regret is just love with nowhere to go" spoken while tracing a scar, not abstraction. Final image—kayak as "cradle for the compass"—resonantly reweights regret without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "fog rolled in merrily melancholic," "barnacles like rasp of conscience." Rhythmic control under pressure via refrain compression. No head-hopping; voice modulates from "voice cracking like compass glass" to "steady now."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "utility poles ended, their lights replaced by slow blink of buoy" achieves high density. Minor metaphor risk in "flickering faith flaring like bioluminescence" avoided by immediate grounding in physical action ("trusting the backlash").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via maritime specificity: utility poles as "rosary beads," bioluminescent gut as moral passage. "Rewired" compass as "breath and morning light" synthesizes emotional truth with fresh imagery, avoiding sentimental templates.</comment>
