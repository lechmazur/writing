<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lila’s embodied leadership shines via micro-choices (kissing the bell, flour-dusted touch) and the iron/honey taste of her declaration, but lacks contradictory impulses in peak moments—resilience remains unchallenged.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with seed packets reweighting "tomorrow," but cost legibility slightly falters; the conceptual price of endurance isn’t anchored to a single visceral image like Soraya’s saffron moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor actively constrains movement and amplifies sound, while the bell’s physicality (walnut-sized, tongue-wrapped) charges the final gathering—environment and tool fuse with thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Lila’s "vote cast in the dark" speech, but Tomasz’s question lacks tangible escalation; his doubt doesn’t alter tactics, missing a chance to test her persistence with visible friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from saffron and seed packets as "curriculum," avoiding moralizing, though "declare we are still a people" edges toward thematic echo without sufficient prior tension.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV voice is distinct ("sound folded into night like a secret handshake"), with rhythmic control tightening during bell rings, but Soraya’s dialogue lacks class-specific idiom, slightly flattening voice distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet precise ("tiles cracked like old pottery"), but "sound so soft it was almost the memory of sound" overwrites the moment, diluting tension with near-redundant abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of exile resilience via mundane acts (food runs as "inheritance") avoids tropes, with saffron’s generational weight transforming sanctions into quiet revolution—bold specificity elevates the familiar.</comment>
