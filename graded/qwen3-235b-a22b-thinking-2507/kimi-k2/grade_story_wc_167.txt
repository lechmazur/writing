<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elowen’s resolve to illuminate mundane value while anticipating the city’s inevitable forgetting; her tide-pool micro-choices (shard-dropping, reading ripples) concretely embody sacredness of flaws without therapy-speak, culminating in a renunciation where the cost—world shifting toward amnesia—is legible through the patterns’ prophecy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: rainbow ghosts teaching "ordinary is only unlit treasure" reweights the premise with undeniable social cost (city forgetting small flaws), while the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density escalation (noctilucent clouds refracting through panes) and felt cost in the tide pool’s "tides would reverse" revelation—exact cost image anchored in "the city behind her would forget the language of small flaws."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tide pool functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (communing via ripples shapes her installation decision) and charges closure through the final "rainbow ghosts" image; sensory hierarchy masterfully filters kelp/iron smells and "breathing rainbows" through glazier’s tactile expertise, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elowen’s agency: waiting for clouds tightens options, while tide-pool communion deepens knowledge (ripples revealing shift), culminating in the installation choice that forecloses inaction; cost is unmistakable in "winds would carry new salt" and "city would forget," charging the final image with conceptual weight under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through refracted glass transforming bubbles into planets/birds, avoiding moralizing; the ending’s "ordinary is only unlit treasure" offers resonant non-literal answer to valuing imperfection, with conceptual cost (collective amnesia) legible through "city would forget the language of small flaws" without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct in glazier’s flaw-reading focus ("bubbles became planets, ripples turned into migrating birds"); rhythmic control shines during pressure ("light... shattered them into slow, breathing rainbows") with purposeful compression taught early (noctilucent reckonings), no head-hopping in single-POV lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Minor density spike in "luminous seaweed across the dark vault" slightly muddles physical logic but avoids closure impact; otherwise flawless propulsion ("boots crunching on salt-strewn gravel") with zero loops—final line’s "stained-glass prayers" achieves crystalline specificity without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of harbor glazier’s mundane craft with cosmic stakes (noctilucent clouds refracting flaws into epiphanies) feels inevitable; risk-taking elevates stakes via tide-pool communion as decision engine, transforming "value in the mundane" through lived detail rather than abstraction.</comment>
