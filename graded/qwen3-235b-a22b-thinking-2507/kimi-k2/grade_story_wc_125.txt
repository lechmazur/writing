<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in pivotal knot-revision ("ethically playful no longer"), but fugitive remains abstract, weakening moral echo's concrete stakes. Embodied emotion strong ("pulse to measure the night"), yet secondary pressure lacks on-page depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with undeniable cost: "texture of time shift beneath his palms, soft as breath, sharp as regret" crystallizes Earned Stasis. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—pressure builds through layer-uncovering until rope's transformation reconfigures time's meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Grotto clay enables weaving hair into fibers (tactical constraint), but mineral scent/starlight lack causal pressure on choices. Micro-setting works for closure ("ochre walls... becoming grace"), yet environment doesn't consistently shape mid-scene tactics beyond one beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by poet's agency: each uncovered layer deepens "impossible choices" stake until revision forecloses playfulness. Cost is unmistakable—"rough warmth of human hands working against despair" charges the final image under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through rope's transformation: "texture of time was neither silk nor burr" avoids moralizing. Final image ("fugitive walking away... rope's shadow stretching like a promise") reweights the central question without stating a moral, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct ("mineral water drip," "violet and gold starlight"), rhythm modulates from contemplative to tender. Minor register drift in "ethically playful" (academic term), but compression taught early and voice remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("fibers stiff with salt and old blood" does triple duty). Slight overwriting in "passionate subtlety of the place" (-0.2), but no closure-dulling artifacts. Final line ("light fading into dawn") crystallizes resonance without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: prison rope as "manuscript written in pain" transforms trope through tactile specificity. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes—fugitive "not free but forgiven" avoids safety-middle, though energy beings verge on convenient resolution.</comment>
