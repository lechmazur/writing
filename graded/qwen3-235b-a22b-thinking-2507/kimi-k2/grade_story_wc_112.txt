<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "obliging sky mechanic" vs private urgency; embodied cost crystallizes in nexus spelling brother's name. Minor friction: moth-whales' agitation slightly externalizes her emotional arc without deepening micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: "victory tasted like thawed frost" and magnetic script spelling brother's name. Accumulative lens holds via sensory density escalation (wings' "hush" to "urgent flurries"), though moth-whales' role in collapse borders on coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Magnetic nexus functions as micro-setting: constrains choices (alignment with lattice) and charges closure via frozen brother's name. "Frost-latticed deck" and "ozone" details actively pressure her movement and emotional state, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: lever activation causes corridor collapse, forcing sprint with visible cost (nexus cooling). Stakes deepen through Accumulative lens—dream-songs' shift from "hush" to "flurries" reweights temporal fragility without causal shortcuts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete particulars: brother's age-shifting visions and magnetic script reweight time's nature. Final image ("brother laughing... moth-whales sang of it") offers non-literal answer to "sideways time" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "fist-sized sphere... second heart" reveals mechanic-poet duality. Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure—"boots skimming folding light" compresses action while maintaining voice consistency. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during corridor passage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence multi-tasks ("Lines of light folded inward... Möbius corridor" compresses action/image/theme). Final line recharges "twilight" motif with cost. Near-miss: "mechanically warm air" repetition serves as tactile anchor but borders on loop.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel trope via moth-whales' dream-songs as temporal fabric and "thawed frost" victory. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off—sensory density crystallizes in brother's name. Avoids safety middle with emotionally specific grief as sideways movement.</comment>
