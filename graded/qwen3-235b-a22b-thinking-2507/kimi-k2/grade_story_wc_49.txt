<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Liora's motivation ("restore sacred practices") is clear and embodied through micro-choices like winding the crank, but lacks contradictory impulses; her flawless execution under pressure feels unearned for high-band entry despite strong sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with cost (tears, "decades of packed doubt" loosened), but lens ambiguity pre-midpoint ("coax music back" lacks causal triggers) prevents 9.0; moon's descent provides visible stakes tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The arbor's "gathering hush" and vine tendril function as micro-setting that constrains choice (winding mechanism) and charges the final image ("glow lingered in every leaf"), satisfying the 9+ gate requirement through purposeful object integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via the harvest moon's descent and "final leaf falls" deadline, but pressure stems from atmosphere rather than protagonist agency; the songs' progression deepens meaning without narrowing Liora's tactical options under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through the Heartroot's renewal ("threads of light... seeding dreams"), avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights "sacred practices" as living continuity without stating a moral, satisfying the Q5 quick test perfectly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("copper goggles fogged," "pockets clinking") and rhythmic control shine, though "thrummm" spelling feels gimmicky; voice modulates effectively from "fragile" to "steady" during the song sequence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>No scaffold or loops, but "liquid gold" and "threads of light" border on metaphor overload in high-pressure beats; final line ("mended more than gears") achieves crystalline propulsion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Trope transformation via tinkerer lens (crank+wound tendril) feels organic, but emotional complexity lacks friction; "whimsical" descriptor risks genericity, though "tears tasted like gratitude and rain" offers fresh specificity for high-band eligibility.</comment>
