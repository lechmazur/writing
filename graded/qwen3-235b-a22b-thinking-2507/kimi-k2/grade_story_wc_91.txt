<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses visible; Mara’s reflective consistency lacks internal friction. Strength: embodied epiphany through sand/grit/sting avoids therapy-speak. Weakness: no struggle between competing desires during releases.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (handprint in glass) reconfigures "giving" with conceptual cost ("emptiness was space where others’ fullness could echo"). Accumulative lens holds: each bug release deepens resonance without causality breaks. Cost legible in final shift from seeking to becoming "part of the hush".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Volcanic sand actively charges closure: footprints filling with light, glass handprint trapping bug light. Environment constrains choice (beach as detour) and evolves causally (sand→glass). Meets 9+ gate—final image’s trapped light reweights giving’s texture through setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Accumulative escalation: each bug release deepens Mara’s realization with felt cost (abandoning linear giving). Agency clear in deliberate releases; cost crystallizes when she understands "giving was not subtraction but translation". Single deepening sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete actions: releasing bugs → cosmic tapestry. Final image (trapped bug light) resonates as "partners in the same dance" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; cost is conceptual (fortune gone but never empty). Non-literal answer to "texture of transformation" perfected.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("stars melted," "vibrant hush") reflects Mara’s poetic lens. Rhythm modulates under pressure (short sentences for tension). Minor deduction: "texture of transformation" borders abstraction but redeemed by physical grounding ("grit of sand between toes").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("volcano exhaled a plume of fire, and the black sand drank the heat"). Figurative language coherent throughout—no muddle in peak beats. Final image crystalline: handprint in glass with "trapped forever" light. Near-flawless propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms philanthropy tropes via volcanic setting and "translation" metaphor. Trapped bug light in glass is fresh closure image reweighting premise. Emotional specificity ("first genuine smile since fortune vanished") avoids generic templates. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscurity.</comment>
