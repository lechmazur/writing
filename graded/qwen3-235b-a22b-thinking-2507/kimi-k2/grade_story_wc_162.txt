<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Iona's contradictory impulses—determination versus trembling vulnerability—drive authentic choices, with the terrace climb revealing her hierarchy of values. The reunion earns change through prior grain analysis, though the father's sudden appearance lacks sufficient friction to fully test her endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the maze closing around them crystallizes the cost of "necessary distances" with undeniable pressure. Orientation is immediate, and the Accumulative lens holds, though the transition from terrace to maze floor slightly softens escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The wood grain functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—directing Iona to the sacred threshold—and charges the final image through the chair's rings. Prism light and corn silk transform from description to tactical pressure during the corridor opening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation via deepening understanding (grain analysis → whispered code) narrows options under Accumulative pressure, with the cost of three harvests made visceral in the terrace's "necessary distance." Father's workshop reveal risks coincidence but earns resolution through prior causality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the knot doorway and sanding rhythm, avoiding moralizing; "thresholds are earned" reweights as shared space in the final image. No thematic echo—wisdom arises from grain rings, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "featherly determined" and "fractured hush," with syntax compressing under stress ("storm, stillness, feather"). Minor lexicon drift with "butterfly effect" slightly jars the voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "knot shaped like a doorway" exemplifies high-density specificity. Slight metaphor strain in "shattered butterflies" but closure image ("grain sang of thresholds") remains crystal clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms maze tropes through wood-grain mechanics and prism physics; the "necessary distances" concept feels fresh in execution. Bold Accumulative risk pays off without gimmickry, though the terrace's drift logic edges close to symbolic convenience.</comment>
