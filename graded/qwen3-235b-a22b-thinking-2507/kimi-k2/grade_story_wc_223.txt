<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara's shedding of rehearsed roles while stepping into the penumbra; embodied emotion via soot-stained palms and smoke-clung hair avoids abstraction. Final "STAY" choice earns closure through prior micro-choices like spelling FORGIVE that soften walls, though "benevolently ruthless" risks slight abstraction without more tactile cost demonstration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Mara becoming "guardian of luminous absence" crystallizes stakes with undeniable cost in "would not flinch from painful truths." Accumulative escalation via walking patterns and accumulating stories tightens pressure under the dominant lens, with ghost-pawn footprints reweighting history's cost visibly on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The chessboard functions as micro-setting that constrains choices—Mara arranges fallen pieces into a "silent parliament," and its evolving state (empty squares to ghost-impressions) charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy excels: marble coolness, ivory clacks, and drifting motes filter urgency through Mara's archivist gaze without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (history forgetting pawns) tightens through Mara's agency: walking patterns deepen knowledge as gallery responses escalate pressure. Cost is unmistakable when "benevolently ruthless" resolve requires excising nostalgia "like a surgeon," foreclosing escape via her final "STAY" with penumbra settling as a cloak of commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars—the baker's thrown loaves and silk-scarf-covered mouth—avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "luminous absence" as active archive, answering "how to remember the overlooked?" without stating morals. Slight risk of over-lyricism in "reluctant crown" metaphor but redeemed by concrete fire stories.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices textures (marble coolness, soot weight) and decodes street-urchin ciphers. Rhythmic control shines under pressure—"left two, forward one, pause"—with patterned elision (fire aftermath implied) taught early and paid off in gallery whispers. No head-hopping; psychic distance shrinks during "OBSERVE" walking.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances density: "smoke clung to her hair like a reluctant crown" fuses image and metaphor. Final line recharges "luminous absence" with "ready to greet whatever dawn," avoiding closure muddle. Minor register drift in "nomadic penumbra" but compensated by visceral soot/trembling details in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms tropes: chessboard pawns as historical metaphor, walking as cipher-based archiving. Emotional truth in finch-carrying old man and bread-throwing baker avoids generic templates. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry—removing the whispering gallery would collapse the closure's charged resonance.</comment>
