<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lysandra’s motivation to rescue dying arts manifests in concrete micro-choices: abandoning passive lens-refraction for active bread-baking, her "L" initial sharing space with Amara’s "A". Contradictory impulses (preservation vs. participation) drive the pivotal shift without therapy-speak; embodied dread as "rosewater" color avoids cliché.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: the city’s "mineral silence" reversing through shared bread, foreclosing artifact-preservation. Accumulative lens holds—density builds via sensory pileup (saffron/sorrow scents, dripping stalactites) to the oven’s chord. No causality breaks; "thaw backward" early anchors the reversal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Basalt ovens and emerald lens function as micro-settings that constrain choices: cold ovens force manuscript-fueled ignition, the lens’s clouding dictates the shift to baking. Sensory details serve urgency (cracked bells for fragmented dialects) and charge the finale—steaming bread’s crust becomes "living mosaic of every alphabet".</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through deepening: Lysandra’s failed lens alignment ("reflecting her own iris ringed with dread") forces realization that culture "must be broken and shared". Cost is visceral—the city’s "ice to the touch" thawing into "dripping stalactites in counterpoint". Amara’s recipe drives the turning point without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through bread ritual’s evolution: abandoned initials to shared sacrament, crystallizing "processes to be restarted" without moralizing. Final image—displaced persons singing in "braided strands"—resonates as non-literal answer to cultural survival, avoiding false equivalence (e.g., cinnamon recognition vs. "sha" for song/sorrow).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "rosewater dread", "phosphorescent moss spelling ghost initials" filter world through Lysandra’s curator lens. Rhythm modulates under pressure—short staccato lines during lens failure ("The slab was ice to the touch") versus flowing cadence in baking. Zero head-hopping; elision (beekeeper’s absence) taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; every line propels: "knead until the dough sighs like a thawing river" compresses action, metaphor, and theme. Zero figurative muddle—rosewater dread remains concrete. Final line ("each strand a lifeline") crystallizes closure without overwriting. Text-artifact screen pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms refugee narrative via specific alchemy: bread initials, bees translating song into honeyed chords. Emotional truth in "dialects clashing like cracked bells" avoids generic trauma. Risk-taking (lyric structure, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "mineral silence" reversal feels inevitable.</comment>
