<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine: Lila’s guarded hope ("cautious exuberance trembling") vs. maternal grief embodied in the curl’s warmth. Rowan’s muteness broken by music—not words—earns closure with visceral cost (the tear). Flaw: Marisol’s distance lacks active friction beyond postcards.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: Rowan’s "It didn’t hurt" crystallizes reconfigured stakes under Accumulative lens. Sensory density escalates toward totality (silver ring → copper light), reweighting "lifelong wonder" through the curl’s final glow. No orientation debt; lens clear by eclipse onset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"Dreaming roots" micro-setting constrains choices (Rowan sits as they "lean closer") and charges closure (curl nested between whistle/stone). The hair curl evolves from keepsake to traded object, reweighted by eclipsed sun—environment actively shapes the final image’s resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through eclipse progression: totality forces Lila’s key shift to major, narrowing options to music alone. Cost is visceral (Rowan’s tear) and conceptual (Lila leaving the curl). Agency-driven under Accumulative lens, though "softly adaptive" slightly blurs escalation’s causality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "sound can link what words can’t" becomes embodied in the braided music, not stated. Final image (curl glowing on roots) reweights "wonder" without moralizing—fragile yet nurtured, charged by Rowan’s traded whistle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("wind smelled of crushed pine and old stories"), but "cautious exuberance" repeats 3×, dulling momentum. Dialogue sparse yet potent ("It didn’t hurt" carries subtext). Voice modulates perfectly under pressure until minor rhythmic redundancy in climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with clear propulsion, but "softly adaptive" appears twice (guitar/curl) and "cautious exuberance" thrice—minor scaffold loops. Figurative language stays precise ("chords hovered like fireflies"), yet repetition slightly obscures closure’s immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms eclipse trope through musical therapy lens: "dreaming roots" as micro-setting and curl/whistle trade feel inevitable. Emotional specificity avoids sentimentality, but "baby hair curl" leans familiar. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
