<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in proprioceptive flinching versus deliberate grounding; final renunciation of trauma earned through step-counting causality with visible cost in the "tiny gravestone" notch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands unmistakably when the strap slips free at Fibonacci 13, with cost legible in the roots pulling it downward—"only the notch remained visible"—under a flawless Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The pewter strap constrains every choice (step-counting pressure changes) and charges the final image as a "discharged pendulum," making environment and tool indispensable to the closure's weightless amnesty.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Kael’s agency—reversing direction at 17 steps, walking the spiral—with cost crystallized in the "exact mass of the pewter strap plus the weight of one withheld name" under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the logarithmic spiral’s "diminishing pain" and the final "integration" realization, avoiding moralizing while reweighting trauma as a "ghost of a bruise" without stated morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in proprioceptive math ("bioluminescent algebra," "inverse square law of regret") taught early and paid off at closure, with rhythmic compression under stress ("1, 1, 2, 3...") avoiding head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "cobalt moss" and "discharged pendulum" fuse image and concept without figurative muddle, propelling toward the "soft as amnesty" closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of interrogation trauma with mathematical healing—e.g., "weight of forgiveness" as concrete mass—avoids clichés through specific stakes (17 steps = days of resistance) and bold conceptual risk.</comment>
