<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (seeking understanding vs. resisting resurrection) drives micro-choices like aligning the letter with wood grain, but "intersubjective understanding" slips into diagnostic label-speak during peak emotional pressure, undermining character-bound knowledge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as ash burial reconfigures absence as fertile space; cost is legible in "space granted" and sap-slowing surrender. Lens ambiguity cap avoided by Accumulative/Textural pattern (vine gaps → emotional gaps) holding through final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Amber pavilion's resinous warmth and seventh-row gaps actively constrain choices (letter placement, ash burial), charging the final image. Recurring vineyard architecture shapes tactics and closure, satisfying 9+ gate with purposeful specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the gap realization: "deliberate absence that shaped the whole" reweights harvest timing into emotional necessity. Cost is felt in "surrender" and "bitter and sacred" ash, though escalation lacks one visible price altering tactics mid-beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through viticulture metaphors (mismatched grapes, missing posts) reweighted in closure; "fertile gap" answers central question without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite "intersubjective" slip, with final image charging prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in plant-emotion synesthesia ("fear sharpened basil"), with rhythmic control under pressure. Lyric compression taught early (burned letter as "fragrant lace") pays off in ash communion, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in closure beat, but "algebra of love" metaphor clashes with viticulture lexicon in memory flashback, causing minor coherence drift (-0.3). High density maintained except for redundant "leaves... wine" and "autumn promises" proximity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Viticulture framework transforms "destined mismatches" into specific, non-obvious emotional calculus (harvest timing → relationship pacing). Risk-taking in conceptual closure (ash as root) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "intersubjective" phrase slightly undermines freshness.</comment>
