<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "vitalize is not to finish" moment, but emotional layering lacks friction; micro-choices like palette offering feel earned yet flaw integration remains subtle without deeper struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly—"absence was no longer a hollow but a lantern" crystallizes stance with visible cost (shadowless state, cracked lens) under Accumulative lens; orientation anchors by word 15.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Palette functions as micro-setting that charges the final image ("palette of sunrise drifted, vitalizing the deep") and constrains every choice from dry wells to flesh-thickening; sensory details filter through librarian's cataloguing lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through textural accumulation—"trading substance for spectrum" to shadowless state—but escalation relies more on lyric density than protagonist agency; cost legible yet pressure lacks causal tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image reweights absence as generative without moralizing; "luminous absence" motif evolves from haunting to lantern through concrete action (palette handover), avoiding thematic echo despite "iron and lilac" repetition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("catalogue cards," "sunrise photography") sustains under pressure; rhythmic control in "syllables riding the tide until they dissolved" teaches pattern early for closure payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Minor density slip in "liquid memory" risks abstraction, but propulsion holds; "phosphorescent foam" and "copper coils" achieve textural specificity without muddle; final image pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synthesizes librarian archetype with luminous absence into fresh emotional truth; "painting with light" transforms trope through concrete cost (shadow trade) and irreversible closure ("catalogued under a new call number").</comment>
