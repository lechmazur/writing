<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's layered motivation (stealing wonder to amend fear) and micro-choices (offering birth-name knight) earn closure through embodied action. "Cautious abandon" reveals contradictory impulses, but "chivalrous thief" archetype lacks deeper internal fracture. Lira's sacred playfulness drives pivotal exchange yet remains slightly archetypal. Final choice feels inevitable through prior causality, with cost (buried identity) legible in snowdrop petal's planting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: sky stitching "new rightness" crystallizes options with undeniable cost (Kael's birth-name sacrifice). Causal lens holds perfectly—exchange reveals fear, prompting dawn pour that rewrites sky. Orientation anchors by line 1 ("Kael scaled icebound spire"). Minor deduction: cost escalation lacks visible deepening beyond exchange moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Icebound spire constrains choices (altitude affecting sundial, ice groaning as pressure) and charges final image (dissolving into mist carrying laughter). Pocket sundial lid functions as micro-setting—its dawn melts chess pieces into birds, directly enabling closure. "Grass that chimed" exemplifies purposeful specificity; wrong sky's color shifts mirror internal transformation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fixing wrong sky via amending fear) tightens through Kael's agency: birth-name exchange forces realization, leading to decisive dawn pour. Cost is unmistakable—identity sacrifice (birth-name parchment) and fear release—directly shaping the final sky-revision. Pressure coheres causally with no coincidence; Lira's "price is what you refuse to release" crystallizes moral calculus perfectly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: snowdrop petal planting answers "Will it last?" with "everything amends," avoiding moralizing. Final image (walking toward next wrong sky) reweights wonder as perpetual amendment, not fixed state. Lira's dialogue earns wisdom through struggle ("price is what you refuse to release"), never stating the thesis. No thematic echo—cost is felt in soil-fading chessboard, not explained.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "sky bruised violet and copper like a wound," "breath fogging tiny galaxies" filters world through Kael's thief-poet lens. Rhythm modulates perfectly—short staccato for tension ("He hesitated"), lyrical flow for wonder ("light pooled, melting pieces"). Minor deduction: climax awe slightly uniform ("dawn burst outward" lacks stress-distortion). Zero POV slippage; Lira's dialogue carries subtext through indirection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ice groaning like cathedral organ" exemplifies high-density prose (sensory + metaphor + pressure). Opening/final lines anchor: "sky was wrong" → "sky stitched new rightness." Final beat avoids figurative muddle—"colors tasting of thunder and honey" remains coherent under pressure. One deduction: "cautious abandon" slightly abstract where embodied detail would heighten cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "chivalrous thief" stealing wonder via metaphysical chess game transforms tropes through specific stakes (birth-name exchange). Snowdrop petal/chiming grass details avoid quirkiness, serving emotional truth. Leap closure feels earned yet surprising—"cliff embraces sea" reconfigures risk as inevitability. No derivative echoes; emotional specificity (fear amendment) elevates beyond surface novelty.</comment>
