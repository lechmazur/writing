<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses manifest concretely: "palms open" while realizing the garden "waited for her to remember," avoiding therapy-speak. Micro-choice of unfolding the crane earns the shift from mourning to cultivation with visible cost ("threaded jet beads... for mulch").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "grief was a lens" crystallizes stakes without tidy resolution. Accumulative lens holds—density escalates via cranes illuminating coordinates, reweighting the garden's meaning. Cost legible in "palms open" realization amid enduring loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring origami cranes constrain choices (coordinates guide actions) and charge the final image: "hands full of seeds" transforms jet beads into growth. Observatory tools (refractor eyepiece, vellum stencil) are tactile and purpose-driven, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (grief vs. renewal) deepen through protagonist agency: reading coordinates aloud triggers the garden's manifestation. Escalation via Accumulative lens—cranes projecting coordinates narrow options toward tending the garden, with cost felt in "grief was a lens" realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "darkness could be taught to flower" avoids moralizing by rooting wisdom in concrete labor (threading beads as mulch). Final line reweights grief as cultivation without stating a thesis, though "subdued ardor" risks abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: jeweler’s tactile focus ("vellum," "jet beads") and rhythmic control under pressure ("Ink bled into starlight"). Purposeful elision (time jumps) taught early via "Night after night" and paid off in the garden’s timeless emergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts; metaphors cohere ("pupil dilated by grief," "petals unfolded across the heavens"). High density without clutter—"folding paper into cranes, leaving origami figures with coordinates" advances character and plot simultaneously. Closure image pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis: observatory as grief-space transforms tropes (AI as astrolabe caretaker). Emotional specificity ("lock of hair uncoiled, root and stem") avoids cliché. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes while maintaining causal logic in closure.</comment>
