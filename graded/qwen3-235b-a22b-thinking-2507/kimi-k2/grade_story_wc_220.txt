<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation crystallizes through the unspoken pact to "translate distance into closeness," with the bloodhound’s micro-choices (pressing muzzle to wax, shifting from barking to listening) revealing contradictory impulses between memory and survival. Interiority avoids labels via embodied specifics: "scent is of tobacco caught in a grate," though early motivation could deepen slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when the dog understands distance translates through "altered echoes," not walking—a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost in the "ruined breath" of the wasteland. Accumulative lens holds: sensory density escalates ("air pulses red-gold") to reweight the stake, with the leaf’s projection as pivotal tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The phonograph cylinder constrains choices (spindle mechanics, thumbing grooves) and charges the final image ("cylinders spin onward under starlight"). Scrapyard setting actively pressures movement ("maze of upturned buses") and reconfigures meaning when cranes become "delivered letters," avoiding postcard description through tactile integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating ash-mileage into closeness) tightens when Grayson thumbs the groove, making the air "pulse red-gold" and the leaf blaze—a single decisive deepening under Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the fragility of the "wavering forest" projection, reweighting options toward transcribed color.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "beauty survives as pressure, memory as contour," avoiding moralizing. The final image of cylinders spinning "translating the last sounds of autumn into tomorrow’s fragile dawn" offers a non-literal answer to loss, charged by prior particulars without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful: the bloodhound’s "retired nostrils flare wider... finding latent molecules of carrot stew." Rhythm modulates from sparse ("he pads between heaps of slag") to dense during revelation, with elision (unspoken pact) taught early and paid off in the closure’s understanding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "wind passes through, carrying off flecks of foil that flutter like defeated flags" achieves high density without muddle. Final line’s "fragile dawn" crystallizes closure with propulsion, while "tobacco caught in a grate" exemplifies textural specificity over abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms post-war tropes via the cylinder/leaf motif: "tinted revelations" feel fresh through embodied mechanics (grooves as "map of pressure"). Emotional specificity in the dog’s "intuitively descriptive" scent recall avoids generic loss, with risk-taking (canine POV) heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
