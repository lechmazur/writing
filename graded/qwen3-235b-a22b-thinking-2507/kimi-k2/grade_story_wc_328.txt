<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Vale's bitterness crystallizes into frost mid-laugh, yet her embodied choice to press the arrowhead to the phone heart reveals hierarchy of values (sibling connection > research caution). Minimal internal conflict in peak beats slightly undercuts 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands decisively: "We were never lost, only rewritten" reweights the premise with cosmic cost visible in Vale's skin becoming "translucent, veins becoming comet tails." Orientation anchors within 40 words via "underground garden beneath abandoned funicular station."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Frost functions as micro-setting constraint: soil lifting around ankles forces Vale's gravitational reorientation, and "frostbitten hope" charges the final image where frost flowers bloom on concrete. Dewdrop-sealed garden becomes indispensable closure object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single escalation beat (phone metamorphosing into obsidian) tightens options to cosmic laughter, with visible cost in Vale's "bitterness crystallizing into frost." Agency shines when she etches coordinates to "turn bitterness into cosmic joke," foreclosing research detachment for active rewriting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through "frost flowers blooming on concrete"—ephemeral galaxies pocketed by strangers answer how to "cradle changed returnees" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite high abstraction by grounding in sensory particulars (sorrowseed scent, glitter grief).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "static thickened, words stretching into whale song"—compression taught early pays off in closure. Voice modulates perfectly under pressure: fragmented syntax during metamorphosis ("Light burst outward...") versus lyrical flow in resolution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "bitterness crystallizing into frost on her tongue" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Figurative language ("vines writhing into constellations") avoids muddle by tethering cosmic scale to concrete action (Vale pressing arrowhead to phone heart).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "cosmic joke" trope through specific herbalist details (snow-mint, sorrowseed) and gravitational play. Risk-taking (phone as ghost conduit) heightens stakes without gimmickry—dewdrop orbiting skyline feels inevitable, not forced.</comment>
