<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied through bronze's heat mirroring rib-ache; micro-choices like following riddles reveal grief-as-compass. Brother remains symbolic rather than active character, limiting relationship crucible potential under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: blood sizzling on bronze, wire cutting palms during the river crossing. Moon's physical influence on bronze ("alloyed blood") slightly strains established rules, softening causality under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Signal station actively constrains choices: perished gaskets and copper wire become literal building materials. River setting in closure lacks prior spatial anchoring, creating minor disorientation that weakens final image's tactile charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's agency through cryptic instructions, narrowing options toward "build the cradle." Resolution leans slightly on mystical convenience (bronze's moon-pull) rather than earned causality under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "raw solace" bridge built from grief; final cool bronze reweights entire premise without moralizing. "Reverse migration" concept remains under-integrated into brother's physical return mechanics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: tactile focus intensifies under stress ("wire cutting palms"), moon-phase cadence modulates rhythm. Single abstraction ("geography of loss") disrupts otherwise flawless voice consistency in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density; "starlight bent, pooling like liquid mercury" shows masterful compression. Slight redundancy in "thin as paper cut/burned like frost" creates minor scaffold in opening beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes through concrete mechanics (soldering constellation cradle), but "censer foot" borders on symbolic convenience rather than organic discovery. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes cohesively.</comment>
