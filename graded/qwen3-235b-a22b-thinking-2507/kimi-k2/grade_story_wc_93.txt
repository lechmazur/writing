<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority shows concrete contradiction (mathematical precision vs. emotional yearning) in stone-adjustment micro-choice; embodied emotion in "heart ticking like a metronome" avoids labels. Final endurance lacks visible cost escalation beyond vision loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("vision folds back into my blood") under Accumulative lens; density peaks when spiral reconfiguration sharpens maternal vision. Late causal trigger (shifting stones) slightly weakens escalation's inevitability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal bluff constrains every choice (rock placement on frictionless sand, jar-filling at edge); "borrowed dawn" motif charges the final image ("inside of a shell"). Aurora isn't backdrop but active pressure shaping the dust-harnessing ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving stars) tightens when mother specifies "that one is tired," forcing protagonist's agency in stone adjustment. Cost ("vision folds back") is felt but lacks tangible consequence; escalation leans slightly passive during vision sequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete ritual (rocks as promises) not abstraction; final image ("eels remember my name") reweights "borrowed dawn" without moralizing. "Sacred patterns" avoids thematic echo by manifesting in logarithmic spiral action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in mathematical framing ("prime numbers," "Fibonacci spiral"); rhythm accelerates during stone adjustment ("kneel, heart ticking..."). No head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early via "friction vanished" world rule.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; "surf hissed without resistance" exemplifies textural specificity. Near-miss in "dust spins, forming tiny galaxies" risks overwriting but pays off in closure. Final line ("eels remember my name") achieves propulsion through concrete afterimage.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "cursed seer" trope via mathematical ritual specificity; tidal bluff setting avoids generic post-apocalypse. Risk-taking (frictionless world) heightens stakes but "precognitive" label slightly dilutes freshness. No derivative premise echoes.</comment>
