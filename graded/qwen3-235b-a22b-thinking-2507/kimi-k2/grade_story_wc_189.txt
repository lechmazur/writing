<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (data-habit vs. craving texture) drives choice to touch cicada; Mara’s arrival shows earned endurance with visible cost in tears on stone. Slight convenience in her tracking dilutes causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: "footprints filling with phosphorescence, each step a stitch" reconfigures their relationship with cost (Mara’s tears on cicada). Accumulative lens holds; tide’s "inhale" marks irreversible shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto’s tidal mechanics constrain every choice—the "pause" enables cicada’s visions, rising water forces return. Final phosphorescent footprints charge closure by making setting an active mender of their story.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elian’s agency: avoiding mother’s silence → confronting unmailed letter. Cost is visceral ("tears salted the stone") and reweights options as they walk home, foreclosing further avoidance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through texture motif: "rough where it breaks, smooth where it holds" reframes time without moralizing. Final line reweights "texture" into forgiveness’s heartbeat space—earned resonance, no abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: chronicler’s "noted temperature, salinity" shifts to valuing "warmth of a sister’s hand." Rhythm mirrors tides—long sentences for calm, staccato beats for tension ("Mara stepped into lantern light").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "barnacles glittered like scattered coins" integrates setting/action. Minor density dip in "color shifting between moss and moon" slightly muddles metaphor but doesn’t obscure closure’s phosphorescent payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "magical object" trope via marine biology specificity (tidal-pool chronicler, salinity notes). Risk-taking: cicada "foresees" through tactile memory, not sound—fresh synthesis that heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
