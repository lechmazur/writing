<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("agonized between them... not out of sentiment") and embodied emotion ("spat into the water, tasting iron") create profound micro-choices; final renunciation of clean narrative earned through sedimentary evidence with felt cost in the guard confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: guard's hesitation between orders and hunger crystallizes the conceptual repricing; "abrasive calm of the sewer decided" shows Accumulative/Textural lens holding through pressure accumulation to final image of viable seeds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sedimentary layers actively constrain choices (digging method shapes findings); "cogs as mechanical pupils" charges the final image while barnacle-rust breathing reweights the city's fate; every detail (algae glow, copper wire) serves the conflict without ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's agency through sedimentary layers deepens the core stake; viable seeds introduce tangible cost that alters tactics, though the guard confrontation's pressure could intensify slightly more before the handoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "seeds of salt-resistant wheat" as non-literal answer to tyranny of convenience; cogs reweighted from relics to "mechanical pupils" avoids moralizing while the republic's fragility charges the final image without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "counting varves of silt the way monks once counted beads"; syntax modulates from lyrical ("brass teeth catching faint green glow") to stark ("I spat into the water") under pressure without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; "fossilized mid-syllable" demonstrates high-density propulsion; minor deduction for "residual heat of centuries" bordering abstraction in peak beat, though redeemed by tactile "tick" and "tasting iron" immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms dystopian tropes through salt-resistant wheat seeds and sedimentary archaeology; "abrasive calm" tone synthesizes philosophical rebellion with visceral decay, avoiding safety-middle through copper-wired coat pockets and bilge-plate tin box specificity.</comment>
