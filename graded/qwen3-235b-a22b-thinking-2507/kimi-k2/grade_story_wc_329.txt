<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in simultaneous fear/determination during heart-rhythm signaling, but "uprooted every fear" risks abstract summarization. Final choice to play "not to command but to thank" earns visible cost through the shell's disintegration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: statues lowering weapons crystallizes options with conceptual cost (shell's destruction). Accumulative lens holds—pressure builds through sensory density until amber light pulse reconfigures meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Locust shell functions as micro-setting, constraining tactics (heartbeat signaling) and charging final image as star-dust. "Resonantly soft" shifts from description to tactical tool to symphony metaphor, avoiding ornamental repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake tightening via statues stacking into tower forces the fear-uprooting choice. Escalation driven by protagonist's agency under Accumulative lens—each heartbeat signal increases density until shell splits, with cost unmistakable in crumbled pendant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of orchard "singing with its own voice" offers resonant answer to central question without moralizing. "Beauty decides to stay" avoids abstraction by grounding in peach blossoms chiming like bells.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: musician's awareness filters "sound softer than snowfall." Rhythmic compression during tower confrontation ("Closing her eyes, she uprooted every fear") heightens pressure without voice slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Resonantly soft" repetition risks overwriting but earns pattern-teaching through escalating significance. Zero loops; "verdigris tears becoming clover" exemplifies high-density propulsion without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Heart-rhythm signaling transforms "music breaks magic" trope through biological specificity (locust shell's brittle wings). "Tarnished wonder" tone avoids cliché via verdigris-to-clover alchemy, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
