<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara’s forbidden search versus self-protection, embodied through tactile psychometry ("breathing slowly, incubating the emulsion’s memories"). Flaws complicate choices: her spatial imagination both reveals love’s location and isolates her. Final renunciation of Lin as external savior—choosing "unspent tenderness" within—earns cost through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds flawlessly: pressure builds via sensory density ("forgotten lyrics nudged the air") until the CR closure where love’s storage in "dark between heartbeats" reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors by word 15 ("projection booth of the Orion Picture Palace"). Cost proof: "love unused is love still" crystallizes the irrevocable shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The projection booth’s dead bulb forces quartz-dependent illumination, constraining Mara’s tactics. The candy tin’s metal reactivates the letter, charging the final image. Micro-setting mastery: "sprocket holes chewed by time" mirrors emotional decay while "balcony as clavicle" spatially manifests love’s residue. Environment directly shapes the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding unused love’s storage) tightens when Mara’s singing cracks the "stale equilibrium," forcing the film to "flutter as if trying to rewind itself." Agency peaks in her choice to thread the film despite the dead bulb, deepening knowledge until the CR closure. Cost is legible in "love unused is love still," reconfiguring meaning under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "interval between frames" becomes the resonant answer to where unused love resides. No moralizing—final image of dawn "rubbed the marquee letters to chalk" charges the concept without stating it. Avoids Thematic Echo; the "dark between heartbeats" reweights the entire premise through earned, non-literal insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mara’s "spatially imaginative mind" filters everything ("aisles as ribs"). Rhythm modulates from lyrical ("hushed thunder of reels") to fragmented ("She recognized the handwriting") under pressure. Voice stays within POV lexicon; no head-hopping. Patterned elision (Lin’s absence) is taught early and paid off in the silhouette’s dissolution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "incubating the emulsion’s memories the way a nightjar warms an alien egg" achieves maximum density without muddle. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully: short clauses ("She recognized the handwriting") amid lyrical passages. Minor deduction for "psychometry reading" explanation (telling), but no artifacts near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms film technology into emotional metaphor ("love stored in the interval between frames"). Avoids tropes through specific, verifiable details (cracked quartz, candy tin). The "dark between heartbeats" reprise feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity—closure hinges on this conceptual reframing.</comment>
