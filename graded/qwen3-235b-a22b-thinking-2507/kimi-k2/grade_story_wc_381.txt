<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when prophecy shifts from warning to question, forcing her to confront silence as presence; micro-choice altering method ("no longer mapping as cage") reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost in the brook's response.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the lantern of silence transforming prophecy into "space between heartbeats" reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost; orientation clear by line 3, accumulative lens held through deepening silence until cost becomes undeniable in final reflection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Brook functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (mapping silence between cricket chirps); origami wing charges closure as "lantern made of silence," meeting 9+ gate through object-as-setting that reweights the final image with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via deepening when she shifts from mapping silence as cage to listening ear, reconfiguring the prophecy's code with visible cost in her realization; agency drives the accumulative pressure, though prophecy's voice ("floods that would erase") lacks sufficient prior buildup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—the crane wing's transformation embodies "hush as presence refined"—with final image offering non-literal answer to "silence world to save it?"; avoids moralizing but "terrestrially cosmic" risks abstract drift near climax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mapping silence between cricket chirps") shows selective noticing; rhythmic control under pressure ("tranquil blaze inside her chest") modulates effectively, though "terrestrially cosmic" slightly clashes with POV lexicon in high-stakes moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("moonlight silvering water into mirror of smoothed hush" does triple duty); minor figurative muddle in "tranquil blaze" (heat vs. cool fire) in one beat, but closure beat pristine with "path of silver leading nowhere."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of origami as cosmic tool transforms trope; emotional truth in "summoning courage to listen" avoids abstraction through specific details (crane wing's pulse, dandelion-seed letters); "terrestrially cosmic" provides non-obvious angle on silence-as-attentiveness.</comment>
