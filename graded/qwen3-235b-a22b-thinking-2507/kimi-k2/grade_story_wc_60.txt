<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. hope) drive key choices under pressure, notably at the seventh fountain where her doubt crystallizes into action. Embodied emotion ("joy pinch inside her chest") avoids labels, but "realistically imaginative" trait lacks sufficient cost-testing in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: geese resuming flight reconfigures the "defiant hush" into celebration with felt cost ("pockets empty, heart full"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—memory collection tightens stakes through density increase, though city resistance lacks concrete consequences beyond shutters slamming.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The stained glass box functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (dissolving into geese), but fails the 9+ gate: no environment/tool constrains a choice—it enables rather than restricts tactics. Sensory details are vividly selective ("dust whispered"), yet the fountains don’t actively alter Elara’s decisions beyond spatial navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation through accumulation: each fountain deepens the cost (box growing heavier) and narrows options, culminating in the seventh fountain’s agency-driven climax. Cost is unmistakable in the emptied box and "pockets empty, heart full," though the city’s resistance remains atmospheric rather than concretely oppositional.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the "defiant hush" transformation—no moralizing, with the final chorus reweighting loss into celebration. Avoids sentimentality via concrete stakes ("box emptied pane by pane"), but the drought’s reversal feels slightly unearned for its scale, missing the 9+ quick test’s depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("colors shifting like thoughts too quick to name") and rhythmic control under pressure ("water coughed, then surged") shine. Minor flaw: "sidereal patience" repetition lacks sufficient variation, bordering on template cadence without meaningful evolution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with clear propulsion ("breadcrumb hovered, then drifted west"). "Defiant hush" refrain is taught early and pays off, but "sidereal patience" appears 3x with minimal variation, approaching template cadence in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms memory-liberation tropes via specific mechanics (breadcrumbs of light, jade geese shattering pipes). Fresh inflection in the box dissolving into geese, though the resolution’s emotional arc leans slightly expected for the premise’s scale.</comment>
