<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-choices under pressure (e.g., noting tremor "with the same calm") reveal contradictory stoicism/sensitivity without therapy-speak; visible cost of bleeding palm and surrendered memories earns the closure. Slight limitation in single-POV depth prevents 9.3+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("palm still bleeding," "price of rebirth") under Accumulative lens; density escalation via successive approximations reweights stakes. "Penny drops" repetition slightly dilutes causality purity at 9.5+ threshold.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (crozier fracture, ember nexus) constrains every choice and charges the final image ("coals held shape of tiny wing"); sensory specificity ("copper taste of certainty") avoids symbolism. No spatial choreography gaps at this scale.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's agency (blood sacrifice, memory transfer) under Accumulative lens with unmistakable cost; "surrender last tether" forecloses obedience. Single dominant stake deepens without requiring secondary conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars ("fracture a luminous scar singing with new scripture"), avoiding moralizing; final command "unmake what was made too certain" reweights premise without stating morals. Slightly overt "creative destruction" naming prevents 9.3.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("copper taste of certainty," "quicksilver light") with rhythmic control under pressure; lyrical compression taught early. Minor register drift in "seraphic contraption" prevents 9.1+ despite purposeful density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high-density lines like "edges melting like wax yet holding shape" propel narrative. Figurative language remains coherent in peak beats, though "seraphic contraption" borders on overwriting without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms alchemy tropes through apostasy ("wings of questions"); emotional specificity in "stoically sensitive" avoids templates. "Broken to become something else" echoes familiar wisdom but gains inevitability via concrete execution.</comment>
