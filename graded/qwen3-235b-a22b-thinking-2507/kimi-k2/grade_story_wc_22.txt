<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Coachman's motivation rooted in embodied grief (ash thumbprints, dried-blood poppies); contradictory impulses act simultaneously as he sows life amid cannon scars. Final choice to plant reef seed with heron guidance earns closure through prior causality—no stock epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: battlefield becoming "a beginning" with flowers shifting color as tide restores concord. Cost legible in "first smile in years" and ash carrying mother's voice. Accumulative lens holds—density peaks with heron's circle enabling final planting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting constrains choices: seed pods cracked in mortar craters, ash thumbprints charging closure. Jetty's tide access directly shapes final action ("where tide could reach"). Sensory details purposeful—"planks warm from day's last sun" anchors time while reflecting urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (poisoned soil vs. regeneration) tightens through heron's circle—a single deepening that narrows options. Cost unmistakable: years without smiles, ash as embodied loss. Agency shown via micro-choices (pressing seeds with ash) under accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image answers central question non-literally: flowers "drinking salt and remember[ing]" reweights "submerged concord" with conceptual cost. Avoids moralizing—theme emerges from heron's reef seed and "bruised purple" petals, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: notices linguistic patterns ("murmuring in Etruscan"), translates bird calls as grammar. Rhythmic control under pressure—long sentences for ritual, clipped action during planting ("He knelt, cracked a pod"). Elision taught early (no explanation of dead languages).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "seeds rattling like tiny coffins" does triple duty (sound, meaning, emotion). Final line "until the flowers glowed" cuts mid-action for propulsion. Figurative language precise—"poppies... color of dried blood" avoids muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: dead languages as living ritual, ash thumbprints as embodied memory. Transforms war/ecology tropes through heron's circle-drawing—a turn growing from established pattern. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
