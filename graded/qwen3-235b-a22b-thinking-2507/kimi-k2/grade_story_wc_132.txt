<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in micro-choices: releasing the leaf instead of grafting it embodies the control/surrender conflict; embodied emotion ("moss felt like the breath she’d been holding") avoids labels. Flaw: minor abstraction in "circuitously sincere" before jasmine’s rebellion grounds it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly—"older, lighter" reflection crystallizes transformation with conceptual cost; Accumulative lens holds via storm’s sensory pressure tightening options. Orientation clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Mossy trellis and linden leaf constrain choices (releasing leaf, naming vines) and charge the final image; rain rewires posture actively. Sensory hierarchy perfect—crisis narrows to touch (moss, leaf) while calm admits jasmine’s "spiral." Micro-setting as crucible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (grief vs. growth) signaled early; storm intensifies pressure via humidity/lightning, narrowing options to surrender. Agency in releasing the leaf drives deepening, with cost legible in "sustained by water that threatened to drown her." Coincidence (storm) complicates but doesn’t resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through leaf’s metamorphosis—final image reweights "reluctant change" as courage without moralizing. "Map of everywhere she needed to go" answers the central question non-literally; avoids sentimentality via concrete cost ("older, lighter"). No thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: nursery-owner lexicon ("graft," "potting bench") and botanical focus filter all description. Rhythm mirrors storm’s intensity—longer sentences in calm, staccato fragments ("Rain softened its outline") under pressure. Zero POV drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "thunder rolled like a question" shows density without muddle. "Jeweled with droplets, each holding a miniature sky" charges closure with multi-jobbing prose. Minor -0.1 for "circuitously sincere" abstraction before embodiment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes through specific nursery logic: "overwatered seedlings" reframes emotional suffocation. Fresh inflection in "reluctant metamorphosis" as botanical inevitability; risks lyric structure but pays off via trellis/moss charging closure. Avoids safety middle.</comment>
