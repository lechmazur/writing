<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (hiding/using baseball) and embodied emotion ("hollow where cruelty had lived") power micro-choices under pressure; time traveler detail lacks causal integration with empathy arc, slightly weakening motivation depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: rising water seals wrong paths while "small steady flame" of empathy crystallizes stance with visible cost ("first unprogrammed emotion bloom"); orientation anchors by word 15 ("clean slate," gunpowder smell).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bioluminescent lake constrains choices (glow dims when hesitating) and charges final image (light clinging like pollen); micro-setting (newspaper headlines as path stones) directly alters tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative escalation intensifies through labyrinth path choices: each step echoes silenced voices, narrowing options via living stone walls pressing close; cost legible in protagonist’s shame-doubled route and hollow blooming with emotion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment><comment>"Delicately robust" evolves from prison graffiti to vending machine oracle and empathy’s flame, reweighting theme through concrete objects; final "journey measured in margins" answers central question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("read between lines like archaeologist reads dust"); rhythmic control under pressure via cadence shifts (short sentences in labyrinth); zero POV slippage despite memory fragments anchored to concrete cues (ink, ball).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "stitches glowed same pale green as lake" fuses object/environment without filter verbs; one borderline abstraction ("empathy sold/stolen back") redeemed by immediate embodied context ("hollow where cruelty lived").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms amnesia trope through specific mechanics (baseball as ink-reactive compass, headlines as path stones); "delicately robust" paradox feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
