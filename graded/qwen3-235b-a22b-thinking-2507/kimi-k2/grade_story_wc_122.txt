<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("numbness crept past her ears into her chest") and embodied emotion ("tears fell onto the drum, absorbed without echo") avoid therapy-speak. Micro-choice threading needle "though it could never spin" reveals character-specific ritual. Single-POV limits relationship depth slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable cost: "the last shard of numbness dissolved" during shared vibration. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density escalation ("filament thickened, weaving silence into song"). Orientation perfect by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Copper drum functions as micro-setting: constrains choices (threading needle, forehead touch) and charges final image ("moonlight slide across it like a backward recorded song"). Sensory hierarchy reflects deaf POV ("felt the season's pulse" vs. visual cues).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early ("numbness crept into her chest"), escalation via textural density ("reversed note peeled away numbness"). Cost legible in dissolved numbness and tears. Agency slightly passive but valid for Accumulative lens; minor deduction for backward method not dramatized in action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "backward" motif reconfiguration: grief rewound into "gratitude" without moralizing. Final image ("dreamed of colors she had once heard") offers non-literal answer to sensory loss. Avoids sentimentality via concrete particulars ("private Morse code spelling hope").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("felt applause," "vibrations travel up her bones") under pressure. Rhythmic control in high-stakes beats ("Images arrived backward..."). Minor register drift in "enthrall the silence" but voice-justified. No dialogue present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; high density ("hush entered her, threading through the hollow"). One borderline decorative phrase ("silver and slow") costs 0.2. Final beat clarity flawless: "moonlight slide across it like a backward recorded song" charges closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deafness/music through sensory reversal. "Filament of hush" transforms cliché into specific mechanism. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional truth avoids abstraction. Derivative drum-maker trope redeemed by "cedar and skin" specificity.</comment>
