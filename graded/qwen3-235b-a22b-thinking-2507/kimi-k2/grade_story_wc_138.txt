<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids stock phrasing ("dull ache of eternity," "intrigue stirred like second heartbeat"), and closure choice to step through the door earns endurance via causal pressure. Minor flaw: contradictory impulses (boredom vs curiosity) lack simultaneous tension during peak mutiny.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("no longer bored, her eternity now threaded with quiet thunder"), and Accumulative lens holds through sensory escalation. Amulet's instant crumbling slightly undercuts earned stasis but doesn't break closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite constrains every choice (magnetic fields, spatial mutiny) and charges the final image ("dust glittering like starlight that learned to say hello"). Micro-setting (central prism platform) directly enables the climax beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering "after goodbye") tightens through solar storm's intensifying pressure, with visible cost in Veyra's transformed eternity. Agency drives escalation ("began to hum," "traced lines of force"), though spatial mutiny's stakes feel slightly thematic versus tactical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the hallway of lanterns—no moralizing, just "light smiles on water" reweighting farewell as accumulated memory. Final image resonates without abstraction, avoiding thematic echo in the profound "everything remembered at once" realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("silence pressed like velvet," "colors shiver toward chaos") modulates rhythm under pressure (staccato mutiny vs lyrical closure). Zero head-hopping; compression ("watched lovers turn to dust") taught early and paid off in the lantern hallway.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with minimal scaffold ("ribbons of charged plasma licking the outer shell"), though minor synonym churn ("tasted every star, walked every corridor") slightly dulls momentum. Final line's "starlight that learned to say hello" delivers perfect closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms immortality trope through specific physics (magnetic fields as emotional conduit) and avoids generic "edge of forever" clichés. Risk-taking (spatial mutiny as farewell metaphor) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
