<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias's embodied choice to honor memory over rewriting, but Lila's off-page presence limits relationship-as-crucible depth despite strong micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost in "Elias stepped back... spoke aloud the promise," fulfilling Q2's cost proof test under accumulative lens; rising creek and matrix chip create coherent pressure without coincidence resolving stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Phosphorescent moss blooming at midsummer actively constrains choice (path narrows to mirror) and charges the final image ("petals of light drifting down like snow"), satisfying Q3's 9+ gate with sensory economy that reflects urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias's agency under accumulative lens (creek rising → ants → matrix chip) reweights the promise stake with felt cost, though the ants' guidance slightly edges toward coincidence without sufficient prior setup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the matrix chip's transformation ("letter that always told the truth" to "metal of promises kept and broken"), with the final image recharging the opening without moralizing; avoids thematic echo despite high abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in map-dealer lexicon ("coastlines for strangers," "coordinates forming in his mind") sustains under pressure, though one filter-verb stack ("he felt the tug") slightly dulls immediacy in a high-stakes beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops but minor register drift in "coordinates forming in his mind" during crisis slightly violates POV lexicon; otherwise high density ("water dripped in a rhythm that matched his pulse") fuels propulsion without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of map-dealer profession with promise motif avoids derivative "magic door" tropes; emotional specificity in "no longer lonely, carrying the letter D" transforms cliché into earned resonance without quirky ornamentation.</comment>
