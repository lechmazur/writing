<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in concrete actions: tracing crater rim like a blind reader, embedding the grain as seed. Contradictory impulses (grief vs. promise to orchid) manifest through micro-choices under pressure. Slight risk of over-poetic interiority but flawlessly embodied; closure choice earned by prior causality with conceptual cost (grain's vaporization).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: shutter click crystallizes options with undeniable cost (grain vaporizing as violet streak). Accumulative lens held perfectly—density increase via countdown tightens stakes without causal breaks. Cost proof evident in "history released as violet streak," reweighting time's fragility under vacuum. Orientation clear by line 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Crater functions as micro-setting that charges closure: "less a scar than a cradle" evolves to hold the orchid's bloom. Summit's thin air directly constrains choices (draining battery, pacing for warmth), while frostbitten silk petals mirror internal state. Environment shapes final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: embedding grain in capsule narrows options to a single decisive moment. Dominant stake (preserving vanishing beauty) tightens via countdown cadence shifts, with conceptual cost legible in grain's vaporization. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens—no coincidence resolves tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: hourglass sand measuring "absence," orchid as "final argument against extinction." Final image (violet capsule bloom matching orchid) reweights time's cost without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality by grounding loss in potassium permanganate's chemical truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: notices "fractures like love letters," "rime" as "brief ghosts." Rhythm modulates with countdown (shorter phrases at "Five minutes"). Zero head-hopping; voice remains character-bound even under grief. Minor register risk in "conceptual cost" but offset by precise technical diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "frostbitten silk" and "dawning hush" avoid mixed metaphors. Sentence propulsion accelerates with countdown ("Ten minutes. She adjusted..."). Final beat achieves high density: capsule ignition, petal unfurling, and shutter click in 27 words without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Space-age melancholy transformed via specific logic: ghost orchid requiring vacuum bloom, potassium permanganate as timer. Fresh synthesis of orbital relics and botanical fragility avoids cliché. Emotional truth anchored in inspector's tactile actions (brushing frost, tracing rim), not abstract elegy.</comment>
