<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in embodied synesthesia ("notes painted the air—vermilion") but final emotional resolution lacks contradictory tension; "no longer hiding behind truth" feels unearned despite micro-choices like sinking the key tag. Mother's letter motivation remains potent yet the vow's completion lacks visible struggle in the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands with undeniable cost: tears blurring the meteor hush and the sinking key tag crystallize grief's transformation. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—the deepening sensory density (jellyfish trails to phonograph) reweights the stake without causal gaps. Final image reconfigures the drowned as "singing in every wave" with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sunken library isn't backdrop but active constraint: barnacled stairs limit movement, floating books supply the cylinder, and bioluminescence directly charges the closure image. The key tag's micro-setting role (striking objects to produce colors) constrains every choice, making environment indispensable to the vow's fulfillment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via the lantern countdown ("last lantern burned out"), but escalation relies on sensory deepening rather than narrowing options. Cost is felt through Miren's tears and sinking the key tag—a conceptual forfeiture—but the pressure lacks a visible tactical shift. Agency shines in her systematic exploration yet the "meaningful deepening" meets scope requirements.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete particulars: the unnamed color of sound reweights grief as enduring resonance ("the drowned were not lost; they sang in every wave"). No moralizing; the final image—sky painted "in the shade of her mother’s lullaby"—answers the central question with earned ambiguity, avoiding thematic echo despite high lyricism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exquisite ("silted whispers that tasted of copper"), with rhythm modulating under pressure (staccato strikes vs. phonograph's unfolding sound). Minor register drift in "a hue that existed only in the moment before grief becomes memory" edges toward abstraction, slightly dulling the library's tactile immediacy during high-stakes discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "She pressed the key tag to a swollen atlas; the paper resonated" merges action and revelation. One template cadence ("She pressed... She closed... She wandered") in the library sequence creates mild momentum drag, but final lines ("painted the sky in the shade of her mother’s lullaby") achieve crystalline density without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synesthesia transforms grief tropes into visceral stakes—the "color of sound" isn't metaphor but lived reality driving every choice. Specificity anchors universals: sharkskin books and kelp-wrapped volumes avoid quirkiness, while the sunken library’s bioluminescence makes emotional truth tangible. Risk-taking heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
