<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (duty vs joy-seeking) drive micro-choices like catching goggles "softly" as wounded bird; embodied emotion in throat tightening at lullaby memory avoids therapy-speak. Final renunciation of claiming the moment earns closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orientation clear by line 3 ("ascending servant... tower"); Accumulative lens holds through prism-light decryption. Cost legible in frozen tears catching aurora colors, but "ten floors" timeframe lacks tactical pressure despite clanging elevator gates.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Icebound spire constrains every choice (frozen diary, thin air at eighth floor) and charges closure as "lighthouse of reclaimed flight." Goggles' cracked glass refracting aurora reweights the setting from prison to beacon with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early ("Burn diary before fleet finds us"), but fleet pressure remains off-stage circling; escalation relies on decryption deepening rather than protagonist agency tightening options. Cost feels earned yet external.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through image: "joy is lift when sorrow ballast thrown" reconfigured in final line where sorrow becomes literal ballast cast skyward. Zero moralizing; aurora-refracted tears resonate without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "gears singing like icicles" and "shrapnel-dented brass"; rhythm accelerates with floor count. Minor deduction as "affectionate detachment" told not shown during critical embrace moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; "ink looping like frost ferns" exemplifies triple-duty prose. One paraphrase near climax ("intended to seek... to return") costs 0.2. Final line’s "lift and promise of joy" avoids sentimentality through concrete ballast metaphor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Synthesizes airship tropes via unique prism-light decryption and ballast-as-sorrow metaphor. "Engines restarting in midair" laugh transforms cliché into visceral emotional truth without gimmickry.</comment>
