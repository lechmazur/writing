<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—open-eyed dreaming versus tactile mending—drive every micro-choice (e.g., placing the plate to trigger transformation). Final stride "no longer sleepwalker but weaver" crystallizes earned endurance with visceral cost: the labyrinth sealing behind her as completion, not loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: "labyrinth sealing like a locket" + "trickle of tide pool refilling" reconfigures ruin into reweaving under Accumulative lens. Conceptual cost—"trusting broken precedents to guide beyond endings"—is legible in the stone boat’s weight and returning water.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Canyon walls function as active constraint: narrowing to "heartbeat width" forces Lira’s stance, while "red dust" settling on the plate directly enables the child’s boat becoming "living stone." Final shimmer charges the closure image with environmental consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lira’s agency: singing braids wind/dust to transform paper into stone, a deepening that reweights "broken precedents" from abstract hope to tangible vessel. Cost is visceral—the labyrinth softening, air thickening with orchids—as she walks the spiral seamlessly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through woven particulars: "knot of grief," "strand of hope," and "bead of reverence" accumulate into the final tide pool’s "promise." No moralizing—only the stone boat’s weight and refilling water reconfigure ruin/reweaving without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in tactile compression: "bruised velvet" walls, "orchid solace" plate. Rhythm modulates under pressure—short phrases for sleepwalking ("walls narrowed"), lyrical swells for transformation ("canyon exhaled fine red dust"). Zero head-hopping; elision taught early via "overlapping paths."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold: "grains of sandstone rustling aside" shows, never tells. Final paragraph’s crystalline propulsion—"dawn bled orchid pink... stride no longer sleepwalker"—avoids figurative muddle while charging closure. "Living stone" and "rewoven" motifs pay off with surgical precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transcends labyrinth tropes via weaving mechanics: sleepwalking as shuttle motion, grief/hope as literal threads. "Broken precedents" concept drives tactics (seeking reversal carvings) and closure, avoiding abstraction. Emotional specificity—orchid seeds blooming "out of season"—feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
