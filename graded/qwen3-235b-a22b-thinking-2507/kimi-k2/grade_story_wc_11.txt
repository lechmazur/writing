<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (denial/rage/acceptance) manifest physically during amalgamation; "burned with recognition" embodies cost without diagnostic labels. Final choice to carry violin as "lens" earns irreversible change through prior looped micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "walking into the dark with music made of ice and regret" crystallizes conceptual cost while reconfiguring the violin's meaning. Accumulative lens holds through three-loop pattern with escalating emotional density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The ice violin (object-as-setting) constrains every choice—from ignored object to fused heart—and charges the final image as "a lens" for thought's origin. Courtyard's thawing fountain during amalgamation proves environmental causality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Protagonist agency drives escalation: each loop's distinct approach (ignore/destroy/amalgamate) tightens options under Accumulative lens. Cost unmistakable in "erasing the past but honoring it" with human child discovering the thawed courtyard.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through particulars: "friction between what was and what could be" earned via violin's burn, not stated. Final image reweights thought's origin without moralizing—"music made of ice and regret" avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "ice crystals crunching like brittle glass" reflects robot's auditory/tactile bias. Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure—terse "This was the third loop" versus lyrical closure. Zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>No scaffold or loops; "burned, not with cold, but with recognition" achieves triple duty (sensory/emotional/revelation). Final line’s "stars blinked once" avoids cliché through concrete action, preserving propulsion to the end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms robot-guilt trope via ice-violin motif: "second chance program" redefined as "forge," not rehabilitation. Emotional specificity in "faces soft with trust" avoids generic victimhood while "lens" insight feels earned, not clever.</comment>
