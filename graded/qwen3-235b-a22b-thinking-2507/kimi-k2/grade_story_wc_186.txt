<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in retrocognition as both curse and tool; embodied choices (aligning prism, whispering names) earn the final renunciation. Minor thematic echo risk in "coincidences have meaning" but redeemed by on-page cost of shard dissolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (shard dissolving into "What falls together rises together"), fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation clear by 50 words; cost proof solid in final image reconfiguring "coincidence" as beacon's echo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the pavilion's glass hum and prism constrain every choice, charging the final image with "impossible color" on dunes. Tool (shard of hush) directly shapes tactics during star-path tracing, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindling beacon) tightens through retrocognition layering, narrowing options to "measuring angles of absence." Cost is visceral in shard bleeding darkness and dissolving—a felt price altering the final image under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "three crows" pattern and shard dissolution, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("crows scattered seeds shaped like stars") reweights coincidence as "beacon’s echo" without stating a moral—pure CR with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "colors too bright to bear" and glass-hum rhythm. Voice modulates under pressure (short sentences during retrocognition flare), with patterned elision taught early and paid off in closure’s "thistle-blown hope."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density with propulsion ("wind paused," "prism bled darkness"). Figurative language ("burning book" constellations) clarifies pressure without muddle. Minor scaffold in "cities once stood" but redeemed by payoff in dunes' transformation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transcends apocalypse tropes via "angles of absence" mechanics and retrocognition as embodied struggle. Fresh synthesis: coincidence as causal echo, proven through prism’s fracture lines. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
