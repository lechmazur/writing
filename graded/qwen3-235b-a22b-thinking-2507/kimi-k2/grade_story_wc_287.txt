<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("wistfully pragmatic," "could shield it or smother it") drives authentic micro-choices; embodied emotion peaks when sap stirs ("throat tightened with protected vulnerability"). Slight over-reliance on grandfather memory for motivation, but anchors present action via gauge tooth use.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "pocket of protected vulnerability" crystallizes stakes through the buds' promise. Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly—the deepening "quivering hush" tightens pressure until sap responds, reconfiguring hope with felt vulnerability. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rosebush as micro-setting constrains every choice (pruning by moonlight, humming to coax sap) and charges the final image: buds "scatter light" because the canes' fragility shaped tactics. Harbor backdrop is atmospheric but the recurring object (rose) is indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by Mira's agency: humming with "rhythm of oars" narrows options from measuring sap to instilling light, with vulnerability as the price. The gulls' silence and watchman's pause deepen pressure texturally; cost is legible in "cupping a match flame in bare hands" during the sap's response.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—humming to make buds form—not abstraction. Final image ("buds tight as secrets") reweights "reflect light into dark corners" as fragile, earned hope without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality by rooting insight in the gauge tooth's "minute click of alignment."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: gardener's specificity ("skeletal rose canes," "green pearls welling"). Rhythm modulates under pressure—lyrical during memory, taut during sap response—without elision artifacts. "Rocking on her heels as if seated in a skiff" teaches the oar cadence early, paying off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion through dense imagery ("fractured moonlight," "bead of green"). Minor scaffold in "closed eyes... opened eyes" sequence, but no closure artifacts. Figurative language ("tears of relief") serves pressure without muddle; rhythm varies to mirror oar cadence during the humming climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "rose as lock" trope through lockmaster's gauge tooth—a fresh, non-obvious synthesis where occupational detail (bitting mechanics) drives the magical realism. Emotional specificity ("wistfully pragmatic") avoids templates; risk-taking (textural escalation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
