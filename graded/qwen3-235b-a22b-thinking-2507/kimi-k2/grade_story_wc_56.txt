<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses crystallize when naming self-lies aloud while sundial burns spiral onto skin—embodied cost of self-deception confronting truth. Flawed motivation (trading decade of notes for myth) intensifies to becoming part of the map without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "serene in the upheaval of knowing every map is a promise waiting to be broken" reconfigures mapping as iterative deception. Accumulative lens holds via sensory density tightening options toward the glass hatch.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Canal’s "water that forgets direction" constrains every choice—paper rope tether, spiral center location, moonlight activation of sundial. Final image ("coastline not yet imagined") charges the micro-setting with irreversible consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake ("understand architecture of lies") deepens via cadence shift: from listening to sounds to naming self-lies, narrowing options to becoming part of the map. Conceptual cost (burning spiral) feels earned but lacks visceral physicality at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Every map is a promise waiting to be broken" emerges from concrete action (stepping through glass), not moralizing. Sundial’s shadow shift from backward to forward reweights deception as inherent to navigation without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("boots soft against creaking planks," "silence of morning radio"), but "serene upheaval" phrasing briefly detaches from Elara’s urgency during high-pressure canal walk.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythmic propulsion falters in "lap of water... clink of chain... absence of birds"—slight sensory checklist. Zero loops, but near-overwriting in "serene upheaval of half-light and half-truth" risks thematic echo in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms cartographer trope via specific mechanics: sundial spinning counterclockwise, paper rope smelling of "salt and old promises." Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry—canal’s directionless water as deception’s engine.</comment>
