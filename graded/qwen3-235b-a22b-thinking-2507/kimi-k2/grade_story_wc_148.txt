<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Leif’s embodied tension between chasing hush and fearing its weight; final choice to "wear it like armor" earns cost through fused ring imagery. Sustaining impossibilities lacks visible tradeoffs until late, slightly weakening escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: Leif’s whispered story reconfigures "hush" into armor with felt cost of impending village interrogation. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—pressure builds through layered confessions and mirror reflections without causal gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lattice-as-tool constrains choices (keying door, fusing into ring) and charges final image; copperlight repose evolves from setting to thematic texture. Jagged reef’s physicality shapes Leif’s descent, avoiding generic symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Accumulative lens: "hush" transforms from silence to swallowed truths, narrowing Leif’s options until endurance becomes his only path. Cost is unmistakable in the ring’s fusion—a visible price paid for carrying legacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: mirrors braiding truths/lie, ring as earned burden. Final image rejects tidy morals—"hush" as armor answers the central question without stating it, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("copperlight repose," "salt wind hover him") modulates rhythm under pressure. Voice stays anchored in Leif’s lexicon; no head-hopping despite lyrical compression. Patterned elision (bodies, father’s death) pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; "copperlight repose" refrain deepens meaning without redundancy. Minor register drift in "sustaining impossibilities" (slightly abstract for peak beat) prevents 9.0, but propulsion remains impeccable through final whisper.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms cry-wolf trope through lighthouse prison’s physicality and "hush" as inherited burden. Risk-taking (mirror labyrinth, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity (confessional lattice, scuffed door) makes universals feel lived.</comment>
