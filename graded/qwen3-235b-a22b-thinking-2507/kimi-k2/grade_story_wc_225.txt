<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Arlen's "productive fidget" masking guilt; embodied emotion peaks when the prodigy's silent king-tip releases him. Final renunciation of guilt earns cost via prior causality—no unmotivated epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the tipped king crystallizes stance with felt cost ("weight lighten, grain separated from husk"). Accumulative lens holds throughout; thunder/rain reweights time's return without retroactive fixes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Platinum labyrinth constrains every choice—Arlen turns sideways to enter, reads chess etchings, decodes tapestry threads. Final image of rain on cobblestone charges closure by making stasis tangible; sensory hierarchy stays character-bound (chess squares over weather).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Arlen's decoding agency: each thread whisper ("You taught fear") deepens guilt until the king-tip reconfigures stakes. Cost is unmistakable in "breathed with it"—the village's first exhale mirrors his release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from chess metaphors ("winnow guilt like chaff") without moralizing. Final tapestry threads weaving "a new border" offers non-literal answer: forgiveness as ongoing process, not tidy resolution—zero thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: chess terms color all observation ("files," "knight’s tour"). Rhythm modulates under pressure—staccato drumming shifts to "quiet cadence" post-closure. Zero head-hopping; lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "polished regret" and "woven hush" deepen meaning without muddle. Final line’s "breathed with it" recharges the opening thunder—textural specificity replaces abstraction ("cobblestone," "frayed threads").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms chess tropes through specificity: guilt as unwinnable game, labyrinth as confession. Risk-taking (time-frozen village as emotional state) heightens stakes without gimmickry; the "invisible king" beat feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
