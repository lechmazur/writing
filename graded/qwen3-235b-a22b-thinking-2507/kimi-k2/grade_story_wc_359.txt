<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied ("tasted the hush," "cedar and longing") but lacks contradictory impulses; motivation clear yet no visible struggle or micro-choices under pressure beyond sensory execution, weakening earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (sculptor's kneeling, bell's trapped aurora) reweights art as felt not heard with conceptual cost, but the precise cost—his silent surrender—lacks explicit legibility in one decisive image, costing 0.4 under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ice cavern constrains every choice: frozen breath resonates as "turquoise silence," marble "refused every chisel" until aurora-charged touch; setting evolves causally (ice crystals to fractal cathedrals) and charges the final bell image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certifying silent wonder) tightens through sensory escalation, but sculptor's arrival feels coincidental rather than protagonist-driven deepening; cost (his kneeling) lands yet lacks prior pressure escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (amber sheet blanking, bell holding aurora) without moralizing, but "wonder did not need to be loud" edges toward thematic echo in climax, narrowly avoiding final-paragraph penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is indelible: synesthetic tasting of silence ("wintergreen and starlight"), rhythmic control shifts from crystalline precision to liquid glass flow under pressure, no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "breath crystallizing into brief chandeliers that shattered" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor overwriting risk in "turquoise silence, amber hush, indigo awe" but redeemed by closure integration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia and sculpture transforms "sculpted hush" from abstraction to tactile reality; risk-taking (silent bell as climax) heightens stakes without gimmickry, avoiding derivative fantasy tropes through glacial specificity.</comment>
