<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "prudently daring" micro-choices (tracing snow glyphs despite wind), but "guilt a scar" veers toward label abstraction without fresh embodiment at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "unused courage was not a place but a state" reconfigures meaning with visceral cost ("broken ties dissolve like frost"), perfectly sustaining the accumulative/textural lens through snow-code density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The pillbox functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (empty yet heart "steadier compass"), while the bluff actively constrains choices—tracing codes on its "white mantle" directly shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation via protagonist agency: decoding snow-melt letters narrows options to the glen pass, with the felt cost of dissolved past ties crystallizing in the valley’s "crystal spring" moment under accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the pillbox’s "final compartment of light" reweights "unused courage" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo while resonating via the spy’s internal shift at the altar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("silver hush," "frost and thaw") modulates rhythm under pressure, though "vouchsafe" slightly drifts from spy’s plausible lexicon in high-stakes moments without sufficient voice motivation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in reflection ("He remembered the day...") slightly dulls momentum, but zero loops in closure beats; "phoenix" light metaphor avoids muddle by charging the valley’s healing with precise textural specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms redemption tropes via snow-code mechanics and "unused courage" as state not place; risk-taking heightens stakes through the pillbox’s tangible map, avoiding derivative safety with "ash-marked" specificity.</comment>
