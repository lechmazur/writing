<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied choices ("gloved fingers trembling," "breath as heavy as fog") under pressure, but lacks contradictory impulses in the pivotal gear-assembly moment; motivation is clear though not deepened by visible internal conflict during the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the vanishing act crystallizes stakes with palpable cost ("heart heavy with driftwood nostalgia"), while the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through the library's transformation; the sunrise reweights prior frost with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frozen library actively constrains choices (frost to cut through, singing crystal volumes), and the gear assortment charges the final image; micro-setting functions as environment when the cracked clock face "like thin ice" directly alters the repair tactic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>Stakes ("broken time") remain abstract despite visceral imagery; escalation deepens through textural accumulation (mirrors rippling to corridor of time), but the tightening lacks narrowed options—pressure grows without constraining the locksmith’s agency during the critical gear placement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "rhythm of repair" and fractured reflections, avoiding moralizing; the final image ("clock ticking steady") resonates as a non-literal answer to mending brokenness, though the "endless voyages" line edges toward sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("coat frayed like old driftwood," "ink trembling like sea-foam") modulates perfectly under pressure; no head-hopping, and the Accumulative lens justifies the lyrical compression—only the "hauntingly bright" repetition slightly blurs rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, with high density ("filament of light that curled like a whisper"), but "hauntingly bright" appears 3x with minimal variation, creating a near-synonym churn in the climax; no figurative muddle, though "trembling like sea-foam" slightly strains coherence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specific, lived detail (moon-shadow keys, singing crystal volumes); the "driftwood nostalgia" synthesis feels inevitable, with risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightening stakes without obscuring closure’s emotional cost.</comment>
