<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete actions (kneeling, adjusting latch) avoids therapy-speak; contradictory impulses (vulnerability/purpose) drive planting choice. Final renunciation of solitude earns rare peace through visible cost of exposure, though secondary pressure absent due to single POV.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: harbor’s "settled chorus" crystallizes Mara’s stance with felt cost (exposed heart now "rare peace"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density shift from "quivering hush" to "steady breath" reweights light’s value. Orientation clear by line 5.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Luminous harbor constrains every choice: moonlight dictates timing ("after final petal drops"), wet planks enable vine glow, fire escape ledge necessitates precarious kneeling. Recurring lockmaster’s tooth charges final image as "smallest tool" unlocking futures, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (darkness vs. light-as-safety) tightens through Mara’s ritual timing ("after final petal drops") and physical vulnerability on ledge. Escalation via density increase—quivering hush transforming to settled chorus—reweights cost as emotional exposure, though no secondary stake deepens pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through luminous vines as "fragile offering" that "keeps night’s secrets from turning to dread." Final image reweights light as "resilient glow" without moralizing, though "truest form of care" risks slight abstraction. No thematic echo in closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: Mara notices "oil lanterns sputtering" but ignores gulls until they mirror vine light. Rhythm modulates from "soft boots" to "circles mimicking oars," with no head-hopping. Elision of backstory taught via rosebush ritual without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "moonbeams with rhythm of oars" integrates action/image without muddle. Minor overwriting in opener ("silver ribbons dancing") deducts 0.3, but peak beats ("hands moved in circles... vines responded") achieve high density. Final line resonates without telling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms gardening trope via fire escape constraints and lockmaster’s tooth as generative tool. "Quivering hush" as tangible pressure (not abstract mood) feels fresh. Avoids safety middle with "pragmatic hope" as living lantern—specific verisimilitude in bitting gauge tooth usage.</comment>
