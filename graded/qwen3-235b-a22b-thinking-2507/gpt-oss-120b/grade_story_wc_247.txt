<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation remains abstract ("soothe souls of those who remembered nothing") without embodied struggle; Arlen's vanishing lacks visible cost. Lira's sudden connection to Arlen feels unearned, violating causality in closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with thematic weight but cost remains conceptual ("joyful sorrow") rather than legible on-page consequence. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds consistently, though escalation lacks tightening pressure per Q4 constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory specificity anchors the harbor, but micro-setting fails to constrain choices—environment remains backdrop, not active pressure. Moonlight and camera imprint charge the final image, narrowly clearing the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating silence) lacks concrete escalation; pressure accumulates texturally but forecloses no path with visible cost. The "forgotten hour" concept tightens stakes yet resolves through atmospheric shift, not earned agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "joyful sorrow" paradox, but Lira’s final vow ("turning absence into endless melody") states the moral outright, triggering -0.6 penalty for thematic echo in closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("silver sigh," "mute grammar") and rhythmic control elevate tension. Elision of Arlen’s backstory taught early pays off in Lira’s inheritance, with no head-hopping in the single-POV mosaic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Overwritten cadence ("each ripple a silver sigh," "frozen memories") creates drumbeat rhythm in high-pressure beats. Template phrasing ("Arlen... Arlen... Arlen") triggers -0.4 loop penalty, muddling closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sign language reframes silence inventively, but risks feel safe—no bold structural deviation beyond lyrical mode. Emotional truth in "joyful sorrow" elevates, yet premise leans on moonlit-harbor tropes without transformative stakes.</comment>
