<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract despite poetic descriptions; "duality of his craft" states rather than embodies contradiction. Micro-choices lack visible tradeoffs—polishing marbles feels inevitable, not a hard-won hierarchy of values. Final endurance earns closure but prior struggle lacks specific, embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: "garden now recognized its keeper" crystallizes stance with felt cost in "weight of both bloom and rot." Orientation anchors by 100 words. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density increases via marble polishings—but "luck gauge" lacks causal integration, slightly muddying escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Garden maze functions as micro-setting: marbles constrain choices (each polish reveals pathways) and charge the final image (fountain whispering stone names). Sensory details ("cold edges like reminder") reflect urgency without checklist. Final mossy voice reply makes environment actively constrain closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving gardens know gardeners) tightens through marble polishings narrowing options toward the oak. But "luck gauge" coincidence complicates without raising cost—measurable hum feels unearned. Agency drives escalation, yet the cost ("fragile yet fierce triumphs") lacks concrete on-page manifestation until final lines.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through marbles: "cracked promises into shining pathways" reweights deception without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—gardener’s whispered "maze itself had learned" implies earned wisdom through action. Final image ("hopeful, measured hymn") resonates non-literally with prior "blooming withering" duality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("vines curling like whispered promises") filters details through gardener’s pragmatic lens. But peak beats overuse lyrical abstraction: "paradox of blooming withering settle in his bones" drifts into therapy-speak, dulling immediacy. Consistent voice otherwise modulates rhythm with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in high-pressure beats: "The act was not mere cleaning but a ritual..." states when showing suffices. Figurative density ("blooming withering symphony") risks muddle but pays off in closure. Strong propulsion otherwise—sentences vary rhythm to match polishing cadence without template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of garden tropes: "mended deception" via marble polishings feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Emotional specificity in "cracked marbles into lattice of truth" avoids abstraction. Risks poetic density but maintains coherence—closure image ("dew on his skin") transforms prior decay motifs with earned hope.</comment>
