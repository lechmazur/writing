<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interior consistency but lacks embodied contradiction under pressure; Mara’s logical precision dominates without visceral struggle against the waterlogged environment’s physical toll. Her micro-choices (scanner readjustment) reveal values but omit credible fatigue or doubt during critical hypothesis shifts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (truth as foundation), but cost proof fails—no exact sentence anchors emotional/relational price paid. Orientation is clear early, yet blackout’s pressure doesn’t meaningfully narrow options beyond Mara’s intellectual pivot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: the antique ink stamp’s brass impression and seeping water actively constrain choices (altering ink hue, revealing cipher), charging the final glowing slab. Sensory details (parchment’s "mournful sigh") filter through Mara’s indexing precision without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (tracing origins) tightens via hypothesis refinement, but escalation lacks visible price—Mara’s breakthroughs feel frictionless. The sacrificial flood theory deepens knowledge, yet no tangible cost (time, physical strain) alters her tactics during the blackout’s pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through stamped glyphs and tidal buoys, avoiding moralizing. Final image—ink settling on the charter slab—resonates as a non-literal answer to "honest origins," reweighting the sunken city’s rebirth without stated morals or balanced toggles.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tranquilly perceptive," water-altered ink observations) with rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulates from methodical cataloguing to reverent daring during hypothesis shifts, avoiding uniform tics. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally with lantern flickers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dappled resolve" and "reclaimed stillness" recur with purposeful specificity (lantern light → buoy glow). Final line’s "chronicle the next chapter" avoids closure muddle, but "mournful sigh" slightly risks sentimental phrasing without deeper embodiment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: logical indexer as truth-keeper transforms sunken-city tropes via ink-stamp ciphers and tidal-powered buoys. Emotional specificity in Mara’s quiet resolve avoids generic templates, though risk-taking stops short of structural boldness that heightens stakes without clarity.</comment>
