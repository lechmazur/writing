<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied choices (sidestepping scout, rope coil maneuver), but "curiously steadfast" label slightly overstates; "sound of trust breaking" motivation feels authentic in lock-crack moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: watch fob ticking metronome crystallizes truce fragility with felt cost ("seed of future conflict"), though sunrise deadline slightly softens tension; Accumulative lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pirate market micro-setting actively pressures choices (lantern storage location, vapor confusion); rotting pier and watch fob constrain tactics, charging final image where fob "pulses the fading night".</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lila's agency: decoy vial and rope maneuver directly alter truce dynamics with visible cost (darkness breaking hush), reweighting "until sunrise" deadline as unavoidable pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through watch fob's recurrence and truce temporality; final image ("market stirs under rotting boards") reweights "hush" as cyclical without moralizing, though "comforting unease" phrasing risks overstatement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct maritime voice ("rumors tasted like iron," "aromatic vapor") with character-particular perception; rhythm modulates under pressure ("dance choreographed through false starts"), no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; minor scaffold in "comforting unease" repetitions. "Brittle note that once echoed" shows textural density without muddle, final image crystallizes closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms pirate tropes through "truce of hush" specificity and moonshine runner lineage; emotional truth in Lila's quiet resolve elevates familiar heist framework with fresh stakes.</comment>
