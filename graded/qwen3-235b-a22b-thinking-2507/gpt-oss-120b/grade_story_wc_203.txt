<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's interior contradiction (burden vs. purpose) manifests in embodied micro-choices: whispering to spirits triggers phantom tug, dust analysis reveals paths. Final ledger retrieval earns quiet purpose with visceral cost—burden transformed into feather-light gratitude.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust patterns deepen into beam diagram, calliope rhythm tightens focus. Charged Poise closure crystallizes when stars blink to barrel's rhythm—cost legible in "weightless burden transformed" with no causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Circus setting actively constrains choices: broken glass ceiling reveals sky guiding her, dust motes' spiral dance dictates movement. Mainspring barrel charges final image as "ticking heart" matching stars—environment shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Mara's agency: following calliope sound escalates risk to attic hatch, where ledger discovery forces emotional trade-off (burden for purpose). Cost is felt in "strange lightness" as she lifts the weightless burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: cracks reconfigured from structural flaws to "frames" via ledger discovery. Final line—"cracked façade hiding stories"—resonates without moralizing, reweighting circus decay as truth-bearing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "skillfully observant eyes" notice dust ridges as ghost paths. Syntax tightens under pressure ("ladder creaking like mournful note"), then breathes in closure. Zero head-hopping; rhythm mirrors her focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold. Every sentence multiplies purpose: "shattered marquee flapped like tired animal" establishes mood + decay. Final line's rhythm ("stars blinking to ticking heart") crystallizes closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elevator technician ghost-seer transforms trope: mainspring barrel repurposed as spectral lantern. "Cracks as frames" insight grows inevitably from dust patterns to ledger. Bold risk in making closure a quiet transformation, not confrontation.</comment>
