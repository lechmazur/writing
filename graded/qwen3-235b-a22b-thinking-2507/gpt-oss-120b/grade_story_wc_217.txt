<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "warmly attentive" trait remains abstract label without embodied struggle or visible cost. Motivation ("discover beauty in incomplete") feels imposed rather than earned through specific pressure on the poet.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: feather settling reconfigures "woven dawns" into undeniable conceptual cost of embracing fragmentation. Accumulative lens holds with density shift in final image, though early disorientation risks orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cobalt lagoon functions as micro-setting that charges closure (ripples knitting into tapestry), but "drake's feather" lacks environmental constraint on choices. Sensory details vivid yet occasionally override urgency ("amber light brushing reeds like soft copper").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harmonizing discord) tightens through feather's placement, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure. Cost is conceptual (accepting incompleteness) yet feels abstract; kite-string snaps complicate but don't deepen the central tension meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "woven dawns" reprise, but final paragraph's explicit "beauty thrives in incomplete" triggers Thematic Echo penalty. Avoids sentimentality yet overstates wisdom ("true art was never a finished picture").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in salt-air-as-sigh imagery, but "warmly attentive" recurs as filter-verb substitute. Voice modulates effectively under pressure though lexicon occasionally drifts toward abstract ("fragment of woven dawns").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Severe overwriting: "woven dawns" (5x), "burnished hush" (3x) create synonym churn. Mixed metaphors ("kite string snaps... sending ripples") violate physical logic. Final image saved by "feather floating like solitary star" propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shoreline poet trope through "woven dawns" concept, but emotional specificity lacks bold risk. Avoids genericity via drake feather motif yet derivative in "beauty in incomplete" resolution. No safety-hedging.</comment>
