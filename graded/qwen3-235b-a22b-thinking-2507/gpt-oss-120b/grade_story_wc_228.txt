<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels ("intimate aloofness") without embodied contradiction; the chest revelation lacks causal setup, making the promise's test feel unearned despite strong melancholic voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (isolated eternity), but the chest key's retroactive connection to hidden studio art breaks causality, weakening the "test" escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid coastal atmosphere lacks constraint on choices; the cave's "shattered mirror" pool charges the final image but doesn't actively shape tactics earlier (e.g., navigation never tests perception).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes ("temporary eternity") deepen texturally, but protagonist agency evaporates during the cave sequence—pressure stems from coincidence (wrong turn), not choices that narrow options or show tangible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme collapses into final-paragraph moralizing ("moments can stretch beyond their ordinary span"), triggering Thematic Echo penalty; the "quiet oath" tells rather than reweights the premise through action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Painter's perceptual signature (color metaphors) is consistent, but rhythmic control falters under pressure—template cadence ("I reached... trembling... lifted... humming") dulls the key reveal's intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Overwritten descriptions ("shafts of golden light, a pool of crystal water reflected...") create density muddle; synonym churn ("linger longer," "dissolve with the next sunrise") in high-pressure beats obscures causal flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of painted seashells as time vessels elevates familiar "eternity" trope, but the chest/key device feels derivative (Da Vinci Code-esque), lacking transformation through painter-specific logic.</comment>
