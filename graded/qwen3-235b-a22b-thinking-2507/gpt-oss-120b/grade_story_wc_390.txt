<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s "logically emotional" contradiction drives micro-choices (calibrating amplitude while heart "whispered"), but the tear’s sentimentality slightly undermines earned emotional complexity at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("tear... logical acknowledgment of beauty"), under Accumulative lens; density peaks via vibrational precision, though lens clarity arrives just past midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina constrains choice (floes shiver to sound) and charges final image ("beam painted frozen slabs with ethereal glow"); copper drum/key as micro-setting shapes tactics decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through vibrational matching’s agency-driven deepening, with visible cost in tear and "less fractured" world; sunset’s urgency narrows options but secondary conflict with seekers remains off-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges via action (sonic absolution dissolving grief into hum), avoiding moralizing; final lullaby image reweights prior material non-literally, though "redemption" risks overstatement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature blends engineer’s precision ("432 hertz") with poetic observation ("sea’s sigh"); rhythmic control falters only in "fleshly ethereal" overwriting during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density falters with minor scaffold ("noted the note hovered") and borderline purple prose ("fleshly ethereal glow"), but propulsion remains clean; no closure-impacting artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vibrational science/spirituality avoids tropes via concrete details (copper cradle calibration), though "sonic absolution" concept edges toward familiar emotional-tech fusion.</comment>
