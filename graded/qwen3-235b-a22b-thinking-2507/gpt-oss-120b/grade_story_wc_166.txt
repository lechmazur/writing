<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in exile's purpose ("banishment" vs "pilgrimage") deepens via embodied micro-choices like tracing gaps, though "fledging limits" lacks visible struggle cost until climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost: "voluntarily imposed distance now a conduit" crystallizes exile's transformation; nostalgia ban backstory violates BRR but doesn't break causality under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Twilight garden's sighs constrain her method (observing tide gaps), and moonstone speck's physical properties directly enable the cosmic verse etching, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through pressure of "slipping through invisible cracks," but cost of fledging remains abstract until ink application; escalation lacks one visible pre-climax price for 8.2+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "gaps" motif reweighted by final dust-drift: exile's voids become conduits. Avoids moralizing but "cosmic verse" borders on abstraction without skin's heartbeat pulse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "moonlight fell like spilled ink" and tide/garden rhythm observations; rhythmic control intensifies during verse etching without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor synonym churn ("obsidian grace" repetition) and density spike in "swallowing darkness" beat; no closure-dulling artifacts but prevents 8.8+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of exile as active bridge via tide-dancer mechanics, though "nostalgia ban" feels derivative; emotional truth in dissolving self through art elevates beyond trope.</comment>
