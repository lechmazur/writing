<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "cracked saint" authenticity and embodied regret, but single-POV limits relationship crucible despite Mara's off-page presence; micro-choices (spiral arrangement) reveal value hierarchy with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("weight of ash in every breath") under Accumulative/Textural lens; orchard's fall crystallizes irreversible stakes without soft reset, though axe timing slightly blurs cost immediacy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perfume bottle and sheet music constrain choices (spiral circuit creation) and charge final image; sensory specificity ("lilies merged with pine") avoids cliché while reflecting urgency through scent-music interplay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Apology delivery tightens stakes through sensory escalation (glow to fluttering sheet), but "hush before trees cut down" lacks causal time pressure—orchard's fall occurs off-page during apology, diluting tactical urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (stitching shredded scores) not abstraction; "broken mirror" metaphor reweights closure without moralizing, though "imperfect miracles" phrasing risks thematic echo near ending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "whispered rumors turned into verses" lexicon; rhythmic control intensifies under pressure ("notes climb the stairs") with purposeful elision paid off in vapor-formed apology.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "induced currents" repetition (5x in climax) risks density overload; otherwise crystalline propulsion with textural specificity ("dusted relics can conduct grace") avoiding purple prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of gossip-as-exorcism with music archive mechanics feels inevitable; "ethereal grit" tone transformation elevates familiar apology trope through sensory alchemy without gimmickry.</comment>
