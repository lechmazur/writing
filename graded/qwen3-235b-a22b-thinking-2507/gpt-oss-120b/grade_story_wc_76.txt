<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses; "bleak exhilaration" remains a label without embodied conflict. Micro-choices like yoyo spinning show ingenuity but interiority stays abstract, weakening the Earned Stasis cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change with visceral cost: "hunger stone now dim" and vanishing into mist crystallize the conceptual price of rewriting fate under a clear Causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Yoyo constrains choices (spinning decodes gears) and charges closure via sailor's observation. Hunger stone's physical dimming reweights the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: yoyo spin narrows options as gears grind. Cost is unmistakable in the stone's dimming and his disappearance, scaling perfectly to length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through yoyo mechanics and stone's conduit role; sailor's "pulsing rhythm" reweights fate without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo but "latent radiance" lacks deeper integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cliffs rose like jagged teeth") modulates under pressure. Minor register drift in "bleak exhilaration" cliché slightly dulls voice coherence during climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density but "latent radiance" repetition creates scaffold in high-pressure beats. Final line ("rewriting fate") avoids overwriting, though "dying star" metaphor borders on purple prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Yoyo cipher transforms time tropes through specific mechanics; emotional truth in quiet victory avoids gimmickry. Risk-taking heightens stakes while maintaining causal clarity at closure.</comment>
