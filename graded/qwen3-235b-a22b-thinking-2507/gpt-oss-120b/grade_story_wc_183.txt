<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Protagonist remains abstract "chimera twin discoverer" without contradictory impulses; epiphany about "true recapture" feels unearned as no internal conflict drives choices. "Blissfully aberrant" is stated but not embodied through tradeoffs under pressure. Micro-choices lack hierarchy of values despite vivid sensory details.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Orientation Test failure: unclear who/where beyond "mist clung to hull" at 120 words, triggering -0.5 penalty. Closure as Charged Poise (ship turning toward letter-stitched horizon) lands with conceptual cost ("weight and release of unkindled solace"), but causality is passive—ink river "spills," portal opens coincidentally. Lens (Accumulative) holds but escalation lacks protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Capped at 7.0 due to Q2 orientation penalty. Vivid carnival decay ("cracked mirrors," "rust of light") lacks spatial coherence or constraint—decks "littered" but no navigation logic. Micro-setting fails: emerald card charges threads but doesn't alter tactics (e.g., no failed attempts using it). Sensory overload stalls momentum during carousel pirouette.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stakes (recapturing sea verses) signaled early but escalation is externally driven—ink river "spills," garden appears without protagonist tradeoffs. Cost ("weight and release") is conceptual but not tied to her actions; diving into ink feels inevitable, not chosen. Agency as attention (cataloging silence) forecloses no path with visible cost, weakening Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ink/garden motifs without moralizing, but "unkindled solace" repeats 5x as thematic echo rather than embodied conflict. Final image ("catalog the silence") resonates as non-literal answer to "lost syllables," though "trapped freedom" paradox stated not deepened. Avoids sentimentality but lacks complexity—no counter-readings of the garden's value.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ghostly whispers," "watercolor bleeding") with rhythmic control, but filter-verb stacks ("she cradled," "she moved," "she pressed") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Voice modulates effectively during ink dive ("water wrap around her like a storybook"), though "rust of light" metaphor violates established physical logic. No dialogue, so voice contamination penalty avoided.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops: "unkindled solace" repeated 5x with identical phrasing; "memories alter" echoed verbatim. Mixed metaphor ("rust of light") contradicts physical rules. Artifacts infect closure beat ("weight and release of unkindled solace now finally kindled"), disallowing 9+ globally. Template cadence ("She [verb]ed...") in carousel sequence triggers -0.6 penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Derivative premise: "garden of forgotten names" echoes Borges' Library without transformation; chimera twin feels like Gaiman pastiche. Fresh inflection in ink river flowing backward, but emotional truth undermined by abstract "solace" concept. Avoids safety middle with carnival decay, yet tropes remain ungrounded—no specific human complexity in "forgotten names" stakes.</comment>
