<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>No interior contradiction; epiphany feels unearned without struggle against flaw. "Resolve to mend memory" lacks genuine risk or competing impulse. Strong embodiment but motivation remains abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds but cost remains conceptual ("demure audacity") without concrete legibility. Closure (Earned Stasis) works, yet no exact sentence pinpoints paid price. Orientation anchors delayed but serve closure's whispering motif.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Parapet's rain-slick stones and fireflies create vivid atmosphere, but setting never constrains choices—puddles guide steps without friction. Bamboo whisk functions as micro-setting charging final image ("faint scent left behind"), narrowly clearing 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("appreciate hidden effort") signaled early but pressure never escalates—contemplation remains static. No tightening under Accumulative lens; "demure audacity" asserted but not earned through struggle. Stakes stay abstract despite lyrical intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: fireflies spelling "gratitude" reweights "hidden effort" without moralizing. Final image ("world stitched by hidden patterns") offers resonant non-literal answer. Avoids thematic echo by embedding insight in mending ritual, not direct statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("scintillatingly somber rhythm," "moon paths") with rhythmic control. But "demure audacity" feels imposed rather than character-particular. No head-hopping, though voice lacks modulation during revelation—lyricism stays uniformly elevated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Template cadence ("He [verb], his [noun] [verb]-ing") repeats in final third ("He walked...," "He arrived..."). Filter-verb stack ("felt the weight," "felt patterns settle") dulls immediacy. Gorgeous imagery undermined by scaffold in closure beats, disallowing 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mending philosophy with firefly patterns avoids cliché through tactile tools (bamboo whisk as loom). Emotional truth in "unseen hands" elevates trope, but "net-mender philosopher" edges toward archetype without deeper transformation.</comment>
