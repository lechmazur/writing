<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Interiority lacks embodied contradiction; "steely longing" is stated but not shown through micro-choices under pressure. Final choice feels unmotivated by prior causality beyond thematic yearning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis (clock's final tick) with conceptual cost, but "horizon invites night" timeframe lacks causal pressure. Disorientation serves closure but escalation feels atmospheric rather than driven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory language (ivory keys, silver rain) lacks constraint on choices. Tidal arbor is beautiful postcard description but never pressures tactics or alters options despite prominent placement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("surprise fate") remains abstract; no visible cost paid until closure. "Strategically creative" trait is label-only with no tradeoffs shown during escalation beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "rewriting schedules" vs time's tyranny. Final clock stop reweights time conceptually without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo in the resonant closure image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("leaves shimmering like silver rain") and rhythmic control shine, but "steely longing" repetition becomes a tic in peak beats, slightly muddying emotional specificity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>No paraphrase loops, but "flickering compasses" density in high-pressure beats borders on overwriting. Final image ("taste of steel and longing") edges toward overwritten lyricism without deepening stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of film splicing as musical composition elevates the trope, but "broken clock" and "surprise fate" lack sufficient transformation through character-specific logic.</comment>
