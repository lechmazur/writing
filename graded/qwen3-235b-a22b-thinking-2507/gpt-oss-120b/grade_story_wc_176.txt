<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (gentle fingers vs. thawing fire) and embodied emotion ("snowmelt ardor") are strong, but "after forgiving yourself" reflection lacks micro-choice anchor, risking unearned epiphany. Flaws complicate choices credibly though.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise (traveler's arrival proving memory's continuity) with felt cost (perpetual solstice duty), but the reflective block violates BRR by summarizing doubt without altering present tactics. Lens (Accumulative) holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ceremonial rope constrains choices (must reconfigure braids to unlock names) and charges the final image ("luminous tapestry"), while melting frost veins show setting affecting action. Micro-setting elevates beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stake tightening occurs when rope reconfiguration yields names (Leif/Sigrid), deepening under Accumulative lens. Cost (Mara's solstice commitment) is legible, but escalation lacks a tangible price paid mid-scene beyond emotional shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the rope's transformation—"living conduit that could thaw deepest cold"—without stated morals. Final image (traveler adding "Eira") reweights memory as active process, avoiding Thematic Echo penalties.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frost into ribbons of light") and rhythmic control shine, but "technically gentle" repeats as a tic without evolution. No dialogue, so voice evaluation focuses on internal texture coherence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("cascade of tones spelling forgotten names"), but "snowmelt ardor" repetition creates minor scaffold. No loops in peak beats; final line ("past melt into present") resolves with resonant specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lost wax casting with sound preservation transforms "save memories" trope. Specific rope mechanics and aurora response create inevitability, though occupational detail stays thin beyond tactile relevance.</comment>
