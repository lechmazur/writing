<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete ("methodical calm that felt almost like prayer") and her involuntary truthfulness drives the climax organically. Smugglers lack individuation as a monolithic "they," weakening relationship dynamics under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("greed eclipsed by sudden realization") under Accumulative lens. Minor flaw: virus backstory slightly explanatory rather than anchored in present micro-choices during Mara's confrontation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hanging orchard actively constrains choices (slippery bark, storm sealing the eye) and charges the final image ("moss seal held, glass eye glimmered"). Sensory specificity ("slick with brine") avoids white-room syndrome while filtering through forager's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (communal reflection vs. relic exploitation) tightens meaningfully at smugglers' confrontation. Cost is felt but smugglers' sudden silence lacks deeper earned escalation; their realization borders on convenient rather than pressured.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the glass eye's function, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("truth cultivated, not weaponized") offers resonant non-literal answer, though "psychological safety" terminology slightly undermines earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (forager's root-level noticing) and rhythmic control during storm surges. Minor register drift in "psychological safety" phrase disrupts otherwise consistent lexicon under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong propulsion but "fractured grace" repetition and slight overwriting ("broken cathedral of fruit") create minor loops. No artifacts in closure beat, though "old sorrow" risks abstract label-speak near climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of empathy virus and communal mirror trope through truffle-forager lens. "Hanging orchard" specificity elevates beyond post-apocalyptic clichés, though smugglers' role feels derivative of relic-trade conventions.</comment>
