<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyra’s motivation to silence guilt is clear and embodied in physical actions like stitching amber, but the unspecified nature of her "old guilt" weakens the visceral cost; her contradictory impulses (obsession vs. healing) manifest through the amber’s use yet lack deeper internal friction beyond sorrow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as the laboratory transforms into a sanctuary, with cost legible in "the dissonance inside her chest loosen"; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density, though firmware mechanics remain vague, slightly diluting causality in the resolution beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The laboratory functions as micro-setting: cracked oak desk, amber, and beetle directly constrain Lyra’s choices (e.g., stitching amber to chassis); final image of "newborn’s sigh" charges closure by reweighting the setting from mausoleum to living organ, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hushing guilt) tightens via Lyra’s firmware confrontation, narrowing options to one decisive action; cost is felt in her chest’s "loosen[ing]" but lacks concrete trade-off (e.g., expended resource), preventing higher escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "to tether a cry was to honor a memory," avoiding moralizing; final image of the city singing "a soft lullaby" offers resonant, non-literal answer to sorrow’s weight, with ambiguity in whether guilt is erased or transformed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in phrases like "neon lights flickered like dying stars," with rhythm modulating under pressure (e.g., fragmented clauses during firmware activation); compression taught early via "time folds" pays off in seamless closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in "meteor hush settled like stardust" slightly muddles closure’s clarity; otherwise, high density and propulsion prevail, though one near-synonym loop ("thrummed"/"breathed") in the final paragraph prevents 9.0+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "laboratory of lost sounds" with amber beetle transforms guilt-resolution tropes; emotional specificity in "translating each whimper into a melody" avoids generic templates, while risk-taking (haunted firmware as emotional metaphor) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
