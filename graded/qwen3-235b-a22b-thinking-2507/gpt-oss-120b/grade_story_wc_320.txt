<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Selin's motivation ("find beginning in every ending") drives concrete actions under pressure; embodied contradiction in rejecting nostalgia while trusting shard's promise. Final choice to broadcast the chord forecloses doubt with visible cost (fading glow, pragmatic dawn preparations). Micro-choices like placing shard in crystal slot reveal value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: Selin "letting its serenely electric glow fade into the night" while trusting rebirth, crystallizing decay-to-renewal reconfiguration. Accumulative lens holds—pressure tightens through sensory deepening (static→melody→chord) not causal turns. Orientation clear by word 40 with city/role anchors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Gorge luminescence directly constrains choice: chord frequency matching "hollows in the gorge below" enables village rebirth. Final image ("cables sang a low hymn") charged by setting's evolution from "rusted flagstones" to power banks "feeding light to hanging platforms." Micro-setting (quantum coil, crystal slot) shapes tuning tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transforming decay into renewal) signaled early via "city’s decay" and "final silence." Pressure deepens through Selin’s agency: discarding linear assumptions narrows options to nonlinear interpretation, with felt cost in the shard’s fading glow. Escalation under Accumulative lens via density shift (static→melodic creation).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reconfiguration: "every conclusion contains its seed" proven when chord reveals hidden pathways. Final image ("practical magic... fantasies could be engineered") offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—Selin notes "each ending held seed" as observed fact, not sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "treated whispers of starlight as practical maps" filters professional bias. Rhythm modulates under pressure—short clauses ("She knew...") amid lyrical stretches. "Serenely electric" avoids therapy-speak by anchoring to object behavior. No POV slippage; stress compresses diction during tuning.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor density risk: "discarding assumptions about linear time and linear signal" slightly overwrites core idea. "Serenely electric" repetition functional as motif (3x) but borders scaffold in tuning beat. No closure artifacts; final line’s "catalogue the next hush" propels forward. Strong verbs ("cables humming," "spiral stairwell spiraling") avoid purple prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "practical magic" of engineering wonder from rust via disciplined interpretation. Hollywood fragment transformed from relic to "living key" avoids trope safety. Emotional specificity in Selin’s pragmatism ("drafted a map... noting each node") grounds fantasy. Risk-taking (nonlinear signal as renewal engine) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
