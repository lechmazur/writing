<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation ("texture of time") is embodied through micro-choices like tracing light patterns, but "ethically playful" trait remains label-heavy until the rope-binding climax. Interior contradiction (preserving story vs. honoring escaped soul) lands with felt cost, though early emotional progression lacks sufficient irrationality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing succeeds: binding the rope crystallizes "paradoxical gift" with conceptual cost ("sealing the echo"). Accumulative lens holds through patterned escalation (multiplying choices, spiraling tunnels), though orientation anchors slightly past 120 words weaken initial causality clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Terra-cotta grotto functions as micro-setting that charges closure: walls "breathe" as rope binds, with mineral glaze constraining discovery. Sensory details (electric scent, amber veins) evolve with plot, though starlight's role remains decorative rather than tactical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Accumulative pressure (choices multiplying into "tapestry"), but firefly/lantern dilemma lacks tangible consequences, weakening mid-escalation. Dominant stake (time's texture) reweights at closure with undeniable conceptual cost, though secondary pressure feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through rope/time metaphor ("moments are both rope and thread"), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "impossible choices" as "thread in larger tapestry," but "collective longing" phrasing edges toward thematic echo, diluting earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("verses like cracked shells," "rope frays echoing sighs"), with rhythmic control modulating under pressure. Focalization stays consistent, though late backstory ("prison escape") risks retroactive knowledge without sufficient present-tense micro-choice anchoring.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with lyrical propulsion ("shadows painted ancient murals"), but stacked metaphors in peak beats ("soft, grainy, humming with residual energy") slightly blur causality. Final image avoids scaffold, though minor synonym churn ("passionate subtlety"/"ethically playful") lingers.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of time/rope motif feels inevitable, with energy beings transforming "impossible choices" into tangible stakes. Avoids safety-middle through bold lyric compression, though terra-cotta grotto risks familiar "cave revelation" trope without sufficient transformation.</comment>
