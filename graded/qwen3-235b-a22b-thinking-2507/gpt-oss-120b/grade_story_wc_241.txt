<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation ("widen perspectives responsibly") remains abstract despite grief backdrop; no contradictory impulses shown in scene—Mara's choices flow smoothly without embodied struggle against her gambler nature. Diagnostic label "theoretically rebellious" isn't tested through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure (theorem-writing) lacks visible cost—mother's heart attack is referenced but never dramatizes a trade-off; the "weight" is stated not shown. Accumulative lens holds but conceptual cost remains abstract, failing cost proof test at decisive beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: mica pane evolves from fragile object to closure image, constraining choices (flame activation) and charging final reflection. Sensory selectivity ("old paper and distant thunder") mirrors Mara's mathematical-aesthetic perception under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes (embracing chance) never face concrete test—subway discovery feels coincidental ("seat answered with soft click"), not earned agency. No visible price paid; "weight of collapse" summary replaces dramatized cost that should alter tactics in tunnel.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Lucid contradictions" concept remains a label, not lived experience—final theorem states the theme rather than offering non-literal resolution. Avoids moralizing but epiphany feels tidily earned without grappling with genuine ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (mathematical lens on sensory details) frays under pressure—elevated diction persists during high-stakes tunnel descent without thought degradation. "Clover melancholy" repetition lacks modulation with rising tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in tunnel scene ("phosphorescent symbols formed a map... each intersection corresponded") bloats momentum. No closure artifacts, but "cryptic scrawls" overuse and purple prose ("veins of possibility") dilute density in key beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of probability theory and magic realism feels fresh, but emotional arc is generic—grief resolved through intellectual epiphany lacks unexpected human complexity. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens theme without gimmickry.</comment>
