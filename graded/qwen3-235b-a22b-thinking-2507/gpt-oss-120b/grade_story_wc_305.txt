<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("heart scalloping") without contradictory impulses; forgiveness motivation remains undramatized backstory rather than active pressure. Final renunciation of treasure-hunt mindset lacks visible cost escalation beyond epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: sunrise alignment crystallizes Mara's stance with conceptual cost (abandoning hidden-treasure mythos). Orientation anchors by line 3, but causal gaps in forgiveness backstory weaken cost legibility despite strong final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Umbral grotto functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (sunrise alignment timing) and charges closure with phosphorescent lichen. Vineyard hush permeates sensory hierarchy, evolving from white noise to emotional mirror through tactile grape-scent release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes (finding contentment) remain abstract until climax; "betrayal" backstory lacks on-page test. Pressure deepens via hairpin ritual but cost feels retrospective rather than viscerally felt during the single tightening beat at sunrise alignment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</comment><question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through vine/hairpin cycles, but final paragraph's "contentment was not a hidden treasure" borders on thematic echo. Resonant wine-as-rebirth metaphor compensates, though closure leans toward tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in vineyard-tuned noticing ("breath of cooler air, whisper of pine"), with rhythmic control during ritual ascent. Single-POV stability maintained, though "scallop" motif overextends metaphorical reach in low-pressure moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Figurative muddle in climax ("fermented grapes that lingered like a quiet hymn" conflates scent/sound) disrupts density. Template cadence ("She recalled... She took... She descended") in reflection beats dulls momentum despite otherwise vivid propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms rebirth trope through vineyard-specific logic and hairpin compass utility. Fresh inflection in storm-tending sequence, though "umbral grotto above clouds" risks derivative lyricism without sufficient grounding in tactile vineyard labor.</comment>
