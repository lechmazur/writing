<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear but lacks contradictory impulses; "rest" moment feels predetermined rather than earned micro-choice. Interiority relies on abstract labels ("shadowed rapture") without embodied struggle or flawed decision-making. Final release lacks causal roots in prior character choices, failing 9+ test for earned closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with visceral cost ("sank to cold floor" exhaustion), satisfying Accumulative lens. However, escalation lacks meaningful deepening—the "rest" beat doesn't alter tactics ("merely a pause" undermines causal weight). Orientation strong but escalation insufficiently driven by protagonist agency under lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Astronomical instrument functions as micro-setting that charges the final image ("humming with memory"), satisfying 9+ gate. Weakness: aurora-archway remains atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choice. Strength: "cold stone cool his pulse" ties environment to embodied urgency during high-pressure tracing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freeing creativity) signaled early but escalation lacks protagonist-driven deepening. Pressure accumulates passively via falling stars rather than active choices; "rest" beat fails to narrow options or change knowledge. Cost (fatigue) felt but not tied to meaningful escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "crack in the night" reweights creativity's flow without moralizing. Ending delivers resonant non-literal answer via "freedom" as final word and lingering verses. Avoids thematic echo but slightly over-relies on abstraction ("sanctuary where imagination roamed free") near climax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mote held fragment of forgotten melody") with rhythmic control under pressure. Elision of instrument mechanics taught early and paid off in closure. Minor weakness: abstract phrases like "internal symphony" briefly disrupt concrete POV lexicon during high-stakes tracing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with minimal loops; "traced... traced" repetition in climax serves accumulation purpose. Final image ("crack in the night") avoids figurative muddle. Weakness: "roaring chorus" edges toward cliché in otherwise precise prose, slightly dulling closure's uniqueness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms stargazing trope through specific mechanics (astronomical instrument tracing stars on marble). "Unwritten calendar" and "stardust memory" offer fresh inflection. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes but avoids gimmickry; emotional truth anchored in tangible release ("freedom" as final word).</comment>
