<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("calm rage") and embodied emotion ("heart throbbed with fierce repose") anchor motivation, but micro-choices lack sufficient friction; the pawn sacrifice revelation feels summarily resolved without layered irrationality during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: dissolving the pawn reconfigures meaning with felt cost ("lives lost in the cascade"), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density shifts, though the backstory block slightly overextends BRR limits without altering present tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The "frayed threads" motif constrains choice (decoding entrance) and charges the final image ("banner of peace"), with tactile details like "arranging tiny stones" reflecting the tutor’s chess-centric perception; environment actively shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes (self-forgiveness) tighten through labyrinthine pressure under the Accumulative lens, but the resolution lacks a visible price beyond internal release; the dissolved pawn carries conceptual cost but misses a tangible forfeiture altering post-closure tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from chess metaphors reweighted at closure ("forgiveness was not a single move but a series of openings"), avoiding moralizing; the final image resonates as a non-literal answer to "winnowing regret" without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("traced fingertips along the woven hush") and rhythmic control under pressure shine, though minor register drift occurs in "frayed like old nerves awaiting repair"; elision of the storm’s cause is taught early and pays off in the frozen time motif.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density falters with scaffold phrases ("He remembered the day...") and near-duplicate sensory descriptions ("woven hush" repetition); propulsion slows in reflective blocks, though closure imagery ("platinum walls turning a softer hue") remains vivid and clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms exile tropes through chess-specific stakes and the platinum labyrinth’s fresh metaphor; the "fierce repose" synthesis feels inevitable, though the time-frozen device edges toward familiar magical realism without fully subverting expectations.</comment>
