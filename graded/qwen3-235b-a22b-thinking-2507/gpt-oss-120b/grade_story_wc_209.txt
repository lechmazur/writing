<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "cold doubts" versus "phosphorescent rhythm" heartbeat alignment; embodied tears and "umbral tenderness" wrap avoid therapy-speak. But grandmother backstory lacks micro-choice impact on present tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (world's sigh reweights winter's end with felt cost of relinquished doubts), but orientation delay past 120 words (no temporal anchor beyond "winter's last snow") triggers −0.4 penalty despite functional disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Amber light functions as micro-setting: constrains vision via cathedral glass refraction and charges final image ("amber light of an autumn pavilion"). Rivulets' "silver threads" evolve with plot, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mara's agency: postcard placement narrows options to visceral revelation, with "cold doubts" forfeiture as visible cost. Single deepening (glass cavity discovery) sufficiently reweights the "why flowers bloom" stake under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image ("world exhaled a gentle sigh") resonates non-literally with the central question, avoiding moralizing. "Dawning hush" transforms from atmospheric detail to conceptual cost without thematic echo—wisdom emerges from petal-glow particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("sepia face whispering," "luminous petals a tender echo") persists under pressure with rhythmic control. Minor register drift in "collective memory embedded" momentarily violates artist-POV lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold in closure beats; "rivulets glittered like silver threads" paraphrase loop in mid-scene triggers −0.2. High density ("umbral tenderness of the moment wrapping") avoids purple prose through concrete verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "quest for meaning" trope via specific mechanics: postcard-glass alchemy and "dawning hush" as active concept. Risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional truth anchors universals in amber light physics.</comment>
