<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through pyramid scheme trauma vs. quantum promise allure; micro-choice securing bolt earns closure via embodied tension ("ancient tension echo through fungal veins"). Over-tidied epiphany in final paragraph slightly undermines flaw authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: diamonds' conditional permanence ("only endure while pressure remained tangible") crystallizes conceptual cost. Orientation clear by line 3; Accumulative lens holds through pressure-density escalation. Minor causality gap between hesitation and bolt-securing action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mushroom farm functions as micro-setting: violet glow constrains choices (pressure chamber calibration) and charges final image ("kaleidoscope painting farm in shadowseam wonder"). Bioluminescent spores evolve causally from exhalation to gratitude-spores, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating pressure into diamonds) tightens through glitchy texts' algorithm, narrowing options to one decisive choice. Cost made legible via diamonds' conditional existence. "Virtuously mischievous" trait remains descriptive rather than driving Lira's pressure tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete alchemy: submarine bolt (oppression tool) becoming "beacon of creative alchemy" reweights pyramid scheme trauma. Final image ("threads that weave new futures") resonates without moralizing. Near-miss with ledger metaphor risking thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in quantum-adjacent phrasing ("song humming in fibers of reality"); rhythmic control peaks during pressure chamber sequence. Glitchy texts' playful tone modulates voice without POV leakage. Zero syntactic monotony despite high abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "phosphorescent spores" to "luminescent spores" shows purposeful recurrence. Final paragraph's "abstract weight into literal sparkle" slightly over-tells. Zero figurative muddle despite dense imagery ("seam of light thin as a thought").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms pyramid scheme trope through quantum-pressure alchemy; specificity anchors universals ("rusted submarine porthole bolt remembering ocean's crushing pressure"). Risk-taking (parallel-dimension texts) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth in survivor's righteous mischief.</comment>
