<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (regret/hope) embodied through needle vibration and stitching ritual; micro-choices like timing stitches to gutter ticks show values hierarchy. Final endurance earns closure but "palimpsest promise" backstory lacks tangible friction with present stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: gutter ticks ceasing triggers silver light reveal with felt cost in "boots sinking softly" and "purpose settle like dew." Accumulative lens holds perfectly; density peaks at river's "smooth as a finished stitch" reconfiguration. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fog and needle constrain choices (stitching requires mist-layer observation) and charge final image ("fog lifted... river kept its promise"). Sensory hierarchy flawless—calm moments admit "scent of wet stone," crisis narrows to gutter ticks. Micro-setting (needle) essential to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via gutter-tick countdown, narrowing Arlen's options to passive waiting. Cost is visible in "muddy path" steps and "mind closely attentive to lingering calm." Escalation driven by ambient awareness method, but dominant stake (distilling complexity) lacks concrete opposition beyond time pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through needle/stitching motif reweighted at closure ("not to erase, but to honor each layer"). Avoids moralizing until final paragraph's slight echo ("to distill complexity..."), which nearly triggers penalty but is redeemed by "smooth surface" image. Final line crystallizes earned wisdom without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "fog curled like spindrift," "ticks resonated like tiny bells" filtered through Arlen's textile-trained awareness. Rhythm modulates from languid ("Night fell slowly") to urgent ("final tick slipped away"). Zero POV drift; lyrical compression taught early via palimpsest metaphor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor synonym loop: "percolate through every breath" then "thoughts percolate into the mist" dulls immediacy. Otherwise stellar propulsion—sentences vary from fragments ("He began to stitch invisible threads") to flowing cadences. Final image ("surface smooth as a finished stitch") crystallizes without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms waiting trope through textile logic: distilling complexity via stitching makes emotional truth tangible. Fresh inflection in "rain gutters as metronome" reconfiguring time. Avoids abstraction via "muddy path" physicality. Derivative risk mitigated by gloom-hill specificity and palimpsest reimagining as river memory.</comment>
