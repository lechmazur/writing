<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear motivation (find echo birthplace) but lacks contradictory impulses; illustrator trait informs sketching yet fails to complicate choices under pressure. Embodied emotion strong yet interiority lacks layered conflict beyond singular pursuit, missing the 9+ requirement for simultaneous contradictory drives.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with Mira becoming the echo, but cost ("releasing pendant") feels conceptual rather than visceral—no tangible forfeiture beyond the object. Orientation anchors by line 3, yet cost proof test fails: "released the infinity pendant" lacks felt consequence, warranting the -0.4 deduction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rooftop canals create vivid atmosphere but function as postcard backdrop; they don’t constrain choices (skiff glides effortlessly) or charge the final image beyond aesthetic reflection. Micro-setting potential of pendant is strong, yet environment itself remains decorative, missing the 9+ gate requirement for setting to shape tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through the "interrupted cadence" motif, but escalation lacks tangible trade-offs: Mira’s choices face no narrowing options or tactical cost (e.g., borrowing time requires no sacrifice). Agency drives accumulation, yet the absence of visible price—like exhaustion or lost opportunity—prevents cost from being "unmistakable" per the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "echoes as moments," with the final image ("city’s rhythm restored") reweighting time without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo, yet resolution feels tidily resolved; lacks meaningful ambiguity about whether restoring rhythm sacrifices necessary pauses, missing the complexity for 9+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (illustrator’s visual precision) and rhythmic control with cadence motifs; elision of second character taught early. Near-flawless, but "giant’s nap" metaphor drifts into elevated diction during high-pressure cavern scene, slightly disrupting POV lexicon coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose dazzles with textural density yet contains a paraphrase loop: "luminous ribbon unfurled" (line 12) echoes "luminous echoes" (line 15) without added pressure. Avoids major artifacts, but this redundancy in peak beats prevents 9+ eligibility per Text-Artifact Screen.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time/echo concepts with emotional specificity, yet "giant’s nap" trope feels untransformed—replacing it with "sleeping dragon" wouldn’t alter the arc. Strong risk-taking in lyric structure, but derivative premise guardrail caps high-band potential despite coherent vision.</comment>
