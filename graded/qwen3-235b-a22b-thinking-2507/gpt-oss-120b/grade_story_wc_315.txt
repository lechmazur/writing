<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "burden lift fractionally" vs. "burden would return" shows earned endurance, but "metaphorical weight" label weakens embodiment; micro-choices like vine-reinforcement reveal values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise RR lands with "Hold fast" crystallizing trust stakes, but cost remains abstract ("fractionally lift") without visceral consequence; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through atmospheric pressure buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Parachute buckle functions as micro-setting: constrains choice during revision, charges final image as "symbol of renewed trust"; "moss-dulled metal" specificity shapes tactile resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via radio static escalation, but "Hold fast" resolution leans on coincidence; cost legibility falters as burden "lifts fractionally" without concrete sacrifice shown on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of trust reweights via buckle's transformation from "fallen skyfarer" relic to "tactile promise," avoiding moralizing; final "soundless echo of purpose" offers resonant non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "cathedral of leaves" synesthesia and "silent metronome" rhythm; voice modulates from hushed reverence to urgent action without POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Confetti" simile slightly overwrites during high-pressure revision beat; minor scaffold in "recalling...remembering" repetition, but propulsion remains strong through concrete verbs like "tightened," "slipped," "vanished."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "midnight pattern seeker" trope through tactile problem-solving (vine-reinforced harness); avoids abstraction by grounding "trust" in metal bite and muscle memory.</comment>
