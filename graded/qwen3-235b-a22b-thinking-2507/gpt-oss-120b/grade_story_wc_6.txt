<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority relies on thematic labels ("unyielding compassion") rather than contradictory impulses; the father's arsonist legacy informs backstory but fails to manifest as active internal conflict during the graft action, weakening motivation's causal link to the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Orientation debt: "scarred sky" and "black sand" obscure setting until paragraph 2, violating the 120-word anchor rule; closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost—"weight of lineage lift" is abstract without embodied consequence, failing the cost proof test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Black sand functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (harvested from volcanic beach, resonates with lineage) and charges the final image ("molten amber" at dawn); the lagoon’s physical properties actively shape Mira’s actions and the coin’s resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>No meaningful escalation under accumulative lens: the dominant stake ("scars can sing") faces no opposition or tactical shift—the villagers’ gratitude appears unearned, and the cloud migration timeframe exerts zero pressure on decisions, leaving stakes abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing by making theme emerge from concrete action (sand’s transformation), but "scars can sing" repetition risks thematic echo; the final image reweights fire/water interplay without stating a moral, though conceptual cost lacks visceral specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("kelp-drift peace," "liquid midnight") and rhythmic control under pressure; minor register drift in "unyielding compassion" label is offset by consistent lyrical compression that teaches its pattern early and pays off in the closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Severe overwriting in high-pressure beats: "sang a faint, resonant tone, as if the scar of the sand itself were humming" mixes contradictory metaphors (scar/humming), muddling causality; figurative density obscures the graft’s physical action, dulling closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Transforms "healing scars" trope through volcanic sand’s material specificity and the coin’s tangible mechanics, but red thread symbolism feels checklist-driven; emotional truth anchors universals, though risk-taking lacks conceptual novelty to reach 8.5+.</comment>
