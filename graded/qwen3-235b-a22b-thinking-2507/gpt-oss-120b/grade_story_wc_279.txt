<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied contradiction ("lilac unease dissolve into curiosity"), but motivation remains abstract despite micro-choices; "to discover meaning" lacks tangible cost escalation beyond epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong Charged Poise closure as tile transforms and grotto achieves "pastel peace," but violinist epilogue dilutes Liora's earned resolution; cost of dissolved unease feels conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grotto functions as active micro-setting: condensation-slick walls and shifting sand constrain choices, while "lilac-tinged veil" final image charges closure with environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes stay abstract—lilac unease lacks concrete cost despite vivid language; violinist's arrival introduces secondary conflict without deepening primary tension, violating single-stake focus for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Avoids moralizing through "unlearning is shedding assumptions," but final "testament that meaning can arise from mess" edges toward thematic echo; resonance emerges from sand/grain particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("whispering gallery tile flake, shimmering like a captured sigh") falters with filter-verb stacks ("feeling," "noticing," "felt") in opening beats, dulling immediacy under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stunning lyrical density marred by paraphrase loops ("each line was a question, each curve a tentative answer" adjacent to "forming a dialogue"); "as if the hush itself spoke" weakens metaphor in high-pressure climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "unlearning" via chalk art and whispering tile, but "lilac unease" leans on familiar color-emotion synesthesia; violinist epilogue risks gimmickry without transforming core premise.</comment>
