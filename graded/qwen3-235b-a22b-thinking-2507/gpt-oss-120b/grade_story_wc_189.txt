<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; "warmly observant" trait is stated but never tested with cost. Micro-choices (placing cicada, noting ripples) align with motivation but omit struggle against fatigue or doubt during high-stakes observation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when water brightens with new clarity during the thinning pause, crystallizing the cost of perceiving time's texture ("woven silk" sensation). Accumulative lens holds flawlessly: ripple density intensifies pressure until the jade cicada's glow freezes the pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The tidal pool functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice—ripples become decipherable clues, water's edge softening mirrors anger melting. Final image ("time is not a line but a sea") charges the grotto's reflective surface with conceptual cost, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation via sensory accumulation (owl call altering ripples, breeze softening water's edge) deepens the stake of reading transition periods. Cost is felt in the chronicler's expended emotional labor to "sense the texture of time," though clan conflict remains abstractly off-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment><comment>Theme emerges through tidal physics: "tides never break but always return" reframes human disputes. Final image ("time is a sea, ever ebbing") reweights the opening metaphor without moralizing, charging the "invisible lines" in her notebook with earned conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in tidal rhythm ("script curling like the tide's own handwriting"). Under tension, syntax compresses ("words fell heavy, trembling like stones"), while starlight-lacquer details filter through her scientific-poetic lens without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Minimal scaffold: "she was warmly observant" tells where showing would deepen pressure. No closure-impairing loops; lyrical density serves accumulation ("each ripple became a clue, each shimmer a sentence"). Final line’s "next ripple" recharges opening with zero muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms observation trope through tidal physics methodology—ripples as "sentences," cicada mapping time. Risk-taking heightens stakes: making perception the central action succeeds via concrete sensory logic, avoiding abstraction despite lyrical tone.</comment>
