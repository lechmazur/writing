<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction (curiosity vs. logic) drives micro-choices like transcribing the tile’s shifts, with eyes softening as skepticism transforms; cost—relinquishing pure doubt for a "bridge"—feels earned but slightly abstract in closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the tile’s "steady glow" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost ("turned skepticism into a bridge"), under Accumulative/Textural lens; density escalation via whale-song verses tightens pressure without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The magic square tile as micro-setting constrains Lira’s choices (transcribing patterns) and charges the final image as a "lighthouse for wandering thoughts," fulfilling the 9+ gate by reweighting memory through tangible object logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes (reconciling doubt/wonder) escalate via tile revelations narrowing Lira’s options, with agency in transcribing; cost—emotional shift to "rare peace"—is legible but lacks visceral tangibility in the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through whale-migration arcs and tile patterns, avoiding moralizing; the final image ("memory, like migration, repeats yet never mirrors") offers resonant, non-literal closure without stated morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "dust patterns," "soundless music") and rhythmic control under pressure; voice modulates from clinical ("disciplined precision") to lyrical ("silvered tide of bodies") without elision artifacts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>No paraphrase loops or scaffold; high density with clear propulsion ("numbers glowed faintly, aligning into a forgotten prime sequence"), though "soundless music" slightly muddles metaphor in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of math (magic square), ecology (whale migration), and memory avoids tropes; emotional specificity in "doubt and wonder entwining like whale-heart ribs" elevates beyond surface novelty.</comment>
