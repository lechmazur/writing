<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Liora's altruism lacks contradictory impulses; villagers remain faceless except for Mara's myth. "Strange surge of trust" is label-only emotion without embodied cost. No visible trade-offs in the collective action undermine motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis (continuing the bell ritual) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens, but cost proof fails: no on-page sentence shows sacrifice. Orientation is strong (anchored by paragraph 1), yet nebula's "peak" timing lacks causal pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (singing rock arches, firefly nebula) create immersive atmosphere, but setting never constrains choices—the bell's activation requires no struggle. Final violet-sky image is lyrical yet fails the 9+ gate by not charging closure through object constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("amplify hope") remains abstract; villagers gather effortlessly with zero resistance. No narrowing of options or tangible price paid—brambled hope metaphor promises tension but delivers frictionless unity, violating escalation guardrails for 8.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of unity emerges organically through fireflies and chalk, but final paragraph's "sowing messages... turned ordinary dawns into rites of unity" triggers Thematic Echo penalty. Avoids sentimentality yet states the moral instead of offering a resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "brambled hope" and nebula descriptions, with rhythmic control in dawn sequences. No head-hopping; voice modulates elegantly from hushed whispers to communal action. Lacks pressure-driven syntax shifts during the bell climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet occasionally overwrought ("brambled hope" repeated without evolution). Minor paraphrase loop in final paragraph ("forever strange yet trusted, sowing messages..."). Zero artifacts in closure beat, but "strangely trustworthy" is label-only in high-pressure context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh setting details (orchard planet, chalk messages) transform familiar unity tropes, yet avoids bold risk—no subversion of the altruistic ghost archetype. Emotional specificity in "twin suns" and fireflies feels earned, but conclusion reaffirms expectations without meaningful ambiguity.</comment>
