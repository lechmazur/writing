<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "shrewdly innocent" trait embodied in coral ritual, but child's passivity prevents mutual stakes escalation; motivation ("graft new meaning") stays abstract despite visceral cast-deciphering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure lands with coral vibration and droplet sealing, but cost ("graft won't heal instantly") remains conceptual without concrete on-page forfeiture; anesthetic dependency weakens causal escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Brain coral constrains choices by absorbing trauma mid-scene and charging the final image, but atrium mist functions as mood-setter only—no tactical pressure despite vivid "violet hue" anchoring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes ("unknot fear-laden knots") deepen through coral absorption, yet escalation relies on anesthetic coincidence rather than protagonist agency; "shared anxieties" reweighting lacks tangible tactical cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through coral’s porous lattice binding trauma, with final image rejecting erasure for growth—no moralizing, just resonant "quiet strength" blooming from scars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("foggy veil reflecting shared anxieties"), but "anesthetic kicked in" jarringly shifts into clinical diction during peak pressure, breaking translator’s poetic lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Overwriting dilutes climax: "twilight mist deepening into a dream-like veil that wrapped the translator in a lotus-hearted ache" stacks modifiers; template cadence ("She lifted... placed... When...") dulls closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh coral-trauma synthesis feels inevitable, but "shelled village" and "splint" lean on tropes; specificity ("calcium smoothing jagged edges") saves it from derivative premise guardrail.</comment>
