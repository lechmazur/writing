<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses; empathy motivation remains singular without internal conflict despite high-stakes pressure. Embodied emotion strong in map-tactility ("feeling the ragged paper like a wound") but no competing values tested under duress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: "empathy could rewrite borders" crystallizes options with felt cost of vulnerability ("delicate armor that let her receive... without being overwhelmed"). Orientation clear by word 15; Accumulative lens held through density shift at projector alignment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rain-scoured vault functions as micro-setting that charges closure: its "glistening" walls mirror the protagonist’s emotional state during the "silent hymn," constraining her methodical actions while evolving from sensory detail to thematic vessel.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes (interpreting silence) lack concrete opposition; pressure accumulates texturally but no meaningful tightening occurs—the alignment feels inevitable rather than earned through escalating resistance under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "map tear as portal" metaphor without moralizing; final image reweights borders via "empathy could rewrite" showing non-literal answer to central question about silence as language, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tracing faintest lines on vellum") persists under pressure; rhythmic control in "merged past and present in a single, silent hymn" modulates tension. Zero POV slippage despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "pallid white drizzle that seemed to wash away the edges" achieves high density without muddle. Final line’s "rewrote the borders" recharges "stone echo" with conceptual precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms mapmaking tropes through specific "methodically curious" lens; "shielded openness" reconfigures empathy as active armor. Risk-taking in silence-as-language premise feels inevitable through prior texture.</comment>
