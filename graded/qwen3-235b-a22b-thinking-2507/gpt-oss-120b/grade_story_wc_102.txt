<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Milo's spiritual curiosity drives action (breathing technique) with embodied emotion, but lacks contradictory impulses in climax; "unused love" motivation clear though cost feels conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("healing was not a single act") reweights meaning with conceptual cost (tear's dimmed glow), but cost proof test fails—no exact sentence where sacrifice lands physically or relationally.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Twilight viaduct actively constrains choices: jasmine pollen affects camera obscura mechanics, and silver pollen release charges the final image of blossoms glowing with compassion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through breathing rhythm (agency-driven escalation), but dominant stake ("free unused love") remains abstractly resolved; visible cost (tear dimming) lacks emotional weight to fully charge the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through unused love's transformation into "river of sparks," avoiding moralizing; final image reweights premise with conceptual cost (love as continual revealing), though secondary stake feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("breath syncing with wind sigh") and rhythmic control under pressure; breathing cadence modulates syntax organically without elision issues, teaching pattern early through "four seconds in, four seconds out."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density ("chest expand like a lantern" fuses physiology/theme), but minor overwriting in high-pressure beats ("silver pollen" slightly decorative); no artifacts dull closure's "foggy lucidity" charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "unused love" trope through specific mechanics (breathing as method), though "pilgrim of sparks" concept lacks fresh inflection; emotional specificity in reservoir's "lattice of glowing potential" elevates beyond generic spirituality.</comment>
