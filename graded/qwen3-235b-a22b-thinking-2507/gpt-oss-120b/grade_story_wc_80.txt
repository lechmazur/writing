<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown through embodied tension (calm face vs hammering heart during note placement), but motivation lacks deeper conflict beyond abstract "rebellion against oblivion." "Stoically sensitive" trait informs actions yet remains conceptually thin without tangible stakes beyond preservation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: Mara's whispered vow crystallizes commitment with visible cost (river's sigh acknowledging her oath), under Accumulative lens. Escalation is subtle—single deepening via ink bleeding as "quiet fire"—but sufficient for length; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Submerged pavilion functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choices (wading through cold water, moss on boots) and charges closure (moonlit inkwell reflection). Sensory details like "slick cobblestones" and "scent of algae" are purpose-driven, avoiding tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving memory against oblivion) intensifies via ink bleeding onto notes, but escalation lacks visceral weight—cost remains abstract ("rebellion") rather than concretely felt. Pressure builds coherently under Accumulative lens yet misses deeper trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (placing notes as "small rebellion") not abstraction; final image ("hush of her blaze grew louder") offers resonant answer to memory's persistence. Avoids moralizing while embracing complexity of "interlaced absence" as both loss and legacy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (surveyor noticing "interlaced absence" in architecture) anchors voice, but elevated diction like "hushed blaze of damp copper" occasionally drifts from character lexicon. Consistent psychic distance with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in reflective sections ("cataloguing ghosts of structures left to rot") and redundant "interlaced absence" repetitions (4x) dull momentum. Strong concrete verbs ("wrest," "waded") counterbalance, but figurative muddle ("hushed blaze") lingers in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms familiar "haunted ruin" trope through specific occupational lens (shore surveyor as memory-archivist) and fresh object logic (inkwell as memory vessel). Emotional truth in small acts avoids sentimentality, though "abandoned dreams" risks abstraction.</comment>
