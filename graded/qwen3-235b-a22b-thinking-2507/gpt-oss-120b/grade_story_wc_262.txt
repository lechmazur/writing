<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lacks interior contradiction; protagonist acts as conduit not agent. No visible struggle complicates choices despite high stakes. "Weight of unsent affection" shows embodied cost but no flawed trade-offs. Micro-choices absent during pivotal discoveries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with felt cost ("weight of unsent affection") but escalation falters. Pressure grows through sensory accumulation yet lacks protagonist-driven tightening. Orientation strong but lens (Accumulative) coherence weakens during film-strip expansion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Projection booth vividly rendered yet fails to constrain choices. Film strip functions as micro-setting charging final image (lens as telescope) but booth itself remains decorative. Sensory hierarchy masterful yet environmental pressure on tactics absent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake clear early but pressure never tightens through protagonist agency. Discoveries happen coincidentally (humming reveals box); no earned reversal or cost-altered tactics. "Weight" provides cost but not deepened through escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through letters' transformation; final image reweights "storage" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo but "incubate goodbye letters" slightly over-explains early. Resonant non-literal answer achieved through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature exquisite ("dust swirled like slow snow"); rhythm modulates with pressure. "Psychometry" creates minor register drift in lyrical voice. No head-hopping; compression taught early and paid off in closure's spatial expansion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose mostly lean but "spatially imaginative labyrinth" is label-only scaffolding. Near-closure risks therapy-speak ("empty chambers she had always sensed"). Final image propulsion strong yet minor synonym loops ("whispered/soft syllables") dull immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of film projection and emotional archaeology avoids cliché through specific images (letters as "tiny birds"). "Unused love" concept risks familiarity but transformed via glowing map and spatial logic. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
