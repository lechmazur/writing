<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in "calm defiance" feels thematic rather than personal; no concrete embodiment of cost during crystal transfer weakens closure's earned stakes despite vivid micro-choices like journal ink fading when read.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (dice idle, lab rising) reconfigures meaning but lacks legible cost; no exact sentence shows sacrifice, violating cost proof test despite strong Accumulative/Textural lens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sunken lab's pressure-sealed door and coral tiles function as micro-setting that constrains choice (singing lock open) and charges final image, though rust/water never actively hinder Selene's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate only once (tide rising) with minimal pressure—singing resolves lock effortlessly—failing to narrow options or impose trade-offs; "calm defiance" concept remains abstract rather than testing commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from journal/dance motifs, but final paragraph's "encoded hope" and "shared cipher" moralize explicitly, triggering Thematic Echo penalty that undermines earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (copper braid singing, algae ink) shines, but psychic distance wavers during "lab learned to breathe" anthropomorphism, muddying Selene's embodied POV in pivotal closure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Overwriting plagues closure: "encoded whispers" and "web of solidarity" stack mixed metaphors; "spider spins its web" simile recurs mechanically, dulling the final image's causal clarity per Text-Artifact rule.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms cryptographic tropes through dance/journal synthesis, but "hangman's dice" feels symbolically forced without clear rules; emotional specificity in vulnerability-as-strength elevates beyond generic lyricism.</comment>
