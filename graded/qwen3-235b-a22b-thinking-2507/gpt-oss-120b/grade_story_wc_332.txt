<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation to capture the merchant's dream is clear but lacks internal conflict; Mara's steadfastness avoids contradictory impulses under pressure. No visible cost to her final choice ("quiet joy" feels unearned), failing the 9+ quick test for contradictory causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as valid Charged Poise (longing as bridge), but cost remains conceptual without on-page legibility—no sentence shows sacrifice. Orientation succeeds early ("whispering archipelago"), yet "cost proof test" failure prevents 8.0 despite strong Accumulative lens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Setting creates vivid atmosphere ("fragments of forgotten songs"), but archipelago fails to constrain choices; the palette charges closure only thematically. Misses 9+ gate as environment doesn't alter tactics—micro-setting (camera) lacks causal pressure despite lyrical integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes (capturing runaway dream) signal early, but pressure accumulates without narrowing options—Lio's net catching light relies on coincidence, not Mara's agency. Escalation lacks felt cost; the deepening (realization about longing) forecloses no path with tangible forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "cipher of longing" and jasmine scent; final image ("islands glowed with soft, endless sunrise") offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by rooting insights in Mara's photography, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV maintains stable perceptual signature ("colors bleed into glass like tide"), with rhythmic control intensifying at sunrise climax. Avoids filter-verb pitfalls; lyrical compression taught early ("luminous absence") pays off cleanly in closure, meeting 9+ quick test despite no secondary character voice contrast.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high-density prose ("sunrays trembled over the reef") advances atmosphere without muddle. Final line ("scent of jasmine answer the unanswered questions") avoids cliché through concrete specificity, satisfying 9+ quick test with flawless propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of librarian/light-photographer transforms tropes through specific mechanics (palette's glow vitalizing photographs). Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry; "shared longing as light" feels inevitable yet non-obvious, passing 9+ quick test.</comment>
