<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("prudently adventurous" heart vs. protesting lungs) embodied in corridor entry, but "rebellion against forgetting" epiphany risks abstract moralizing without sufficient prior struggle to ground the cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost ("breath tighten" transforming into dissolving claustrophobia), but the spatial mutiny resolution lacks causal friction—the compass works too seamlessly, muting escalation stakes under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting charges closure: the organ’s pipes and fungi garden’s hum constrain choice (activating compass) and reweight the final image, with stone walls’ "sigh" making architecture an active, embodied pressure throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through spatial mutiny’s tangible cost (claustrophobia tightening breath), but the "rebellion against forgetting" moral remains abstract—pressure lacks visceral personal consequence beyond the explorer’s immediate relief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (key’s dust, fungi hum), but the final epiphany risks thematic echo; redemption arrives via "weight of centuries lift" rather than earned struggle against forgetting’s cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("walls close like a familiar wound") and rhythmic control shine, though "prudently adventurous" strains lexicon; no head-hopping, but stress-induced diction shifts feel slightly polished for peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose dazzles with "blossoming map" and "luminescent fungi," but "heart beat prudently adventurous" is label-speak, and compass/key repetitions risk synonym churn in high-stakes beats without deepening pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spatial geometry and music feels inevitable, yet claustrophobic explorer trope lacks transformation—claustrophobia resolves too neatly, missing the gritty complexity required for 9+ risk distinction.</comment>
