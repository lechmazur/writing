<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority shines through concrete sensory translation (film negative to sound) but "legacy’s burden" phrasing edges toward thematic echo; micro-choices like tracing echoes feel authentic yet the final renunciation lacks visible cost escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the shared tokens transform legacy into communion with conceptual cost (individual burden → collective ritual), though the climate shift timeframe remains atmospheric rather than tightening tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage functions as micro-setting—its seasonal dream shifts directly constrain Lira’s mapping choices, culminating in the final image of tokens nourishing walls’ dreams; sensory specificity ("ash-marred emulsion," "stone aging under new skies") charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen organically from discovery to communion, but climate shifts lack causal pressure; the "shared responsibility" shift feels earned though the cost (solitude to shared burden) isn’t viscerally tested until scholars arrive late in the timeline.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (film negative → tokens), but the final line explicitly states "collective imagination," skirting thematic echo penalty; resonance is undercut by near-moralizing in the penultimate paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exquisite (sound-to-light translation, stone "sighs"), but rhythmic control falters in reflection-heavy passages; "warm ash against her spine" repetition risks scaffold despite poetic intent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion stumbles in two spots: "wilted leaves" simile followed by "ghostly silhouettes" creates subtle synonym churn, and "rain-kissed lullabies" leans toward purple prose; otherwise, density and rhythm serve accumulation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival science and climate grief feels inevitable; "echo cartographer" trope transformed through tactile film-negative mechanics. Avoids derivative pitfalls by grounding dreams in physical objects (feathers, seeds) rather than abstraction.</comment>
