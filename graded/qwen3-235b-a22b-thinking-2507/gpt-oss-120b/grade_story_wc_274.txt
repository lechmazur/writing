<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("bravely conflicted") shown through micro-choices like slipping the letter despite risk, but "brave conflict burned brighter" veers into label-speak without embodied cost escalation during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (green shoots symbolizing hope's fragility), but the cost proof test fails—no exact line where Maren's personal sacrifice (frozen preservation risk) crystallizes beyond thematic assertion in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Snow-white walls and cryogenic coils constrain choices (ink bleeding through walls, melting snow revealing shoots), but occupational details like "cryogenic archivist" lack causal integration—tools remain atmospheric rather than shaping tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Accumulative lens: "dormant networks" humming intensifies to "thunderous echo," narrowing Maren's option to act, but the cost (personal preservation risk) feels abstract rather than viscerally felt in the final beat despite green shoots' symbolism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "contraband truths spreading like frost" and green shoots charging closure, but "symbols of hope birthed from scandal" edges toward thematic echo, nearly violating Q5 penalty for final-paragraph moralizing despite earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("breath forming brief mist that vanished as quickly as the past") shines, but high-pressure beats suffer register drift—"scandalizing the council risked her own frozen preservation" uses clinical diction that clashes with Maren's POV during crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Overwriting in peak beats: "contraband truths spread like frost on glass" followed by "reaching archivists... who had never dared to question" creates paraphrase-loop redundancy; template cadence ("each unlocking... each voice") dulls closure momentum in final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cryogenic archive as political metaphor avoids tropes, but "green shoots" symbolize hope too conventionally; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes yet lacks the irreplaceable specificity required for 8.5+.</comment>
