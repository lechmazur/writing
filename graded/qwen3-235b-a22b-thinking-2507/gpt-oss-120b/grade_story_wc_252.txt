<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("desire to protect... hunger to break free") acts simultaneously in scene; final choice earned through scrimshaw's release. "Combative tenderness" label risks thematic echo but avoids diagnostic phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("weight of centuries lift"), but scrimshaw's hidden compartment lacks causal setup. Accumulative lens holds; whale call's resolution edges toward coincidence without sufficient prior constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Scrimshaw (tool) charges final image when "released to the sea," constraining choice via unlocking mechanics. Sublittoral fringe's wet wood directly affects action ("boots slipping"), satisfying micro-setting gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mara's agency (singing hymn) under Accumulative lens; cost unmistakable in transformed "combative tenderness." Whale call's resolution slightly over-relies on external force, narrowing options without sufficient prior struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image ("island lingered, a beacon") reweights freedom theme without moralizing. "Combative tenderness" evolving into "quiet resolve" offers resonant, non-literal answer to central question through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shavings of bone glinted like moon-struck daggers") with rhythmic control under pressure. "Whispered the whale's hymn, letting the note rise like a blade" showcases syntactic precision during climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but "combative tenderness" repetition (4x) borders template cadence in final third. Salt spray forming "vortex that lifted Mara's boots" exemplifies high-density imagery without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "disappearing island" trope through specific maritime psychology; "combative tenderness" as emotional paradox feels fresh. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring closure charge.</comment>
