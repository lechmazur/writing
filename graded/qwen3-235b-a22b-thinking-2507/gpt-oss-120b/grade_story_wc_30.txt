<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("let his own identity migrate") drives closure, but micro-choices lack visceral embodiment; gears softening is felt cost yet emotional progression remains slightly abstract without specific irrationality under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the creel's glow reconfigures "preserving wonder" with conceptual cost (softened gears, visitors' subtle shifts). Accumulative lens holds perfectly as sensory density tightens toward the final beacon image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tidal atrium constrains every choice—water rising over floor, moon-phased books—and charges closure via pale teal water and fogged windows. Micro-setting (creel's brine scent) directly enables the key's integration, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving wonder after time rupture) escalates through smelting the key, narrowing options to acceptance of contradictions. Cost is legible in softened gears and visitors' quiet gratitude, though emotional weight could deepen further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through migrating stories and moon-phased books, culminating in the non-literal answer: "routine could hold a hidden tide of marvel." Avoids moralizing while charging closure with earned ambiguity about identity's beauty in paradox.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("gears turn slower when light is thin") shines, but minor register drift in "wintersun serenity" slightly disrupts pressure. Voice modulates well under stress, though final paragraph risks over-ornamentation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with zero scaffold, but "silver water lapped against marble arches" borders on decorative. Final image ("beacon for wonder in the mundane") achieves crystalline propulsion, though two adjacent "glow" metaphors dilute peak intensity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal mechanics and identity fluidity avoids tropes; "migrating identities" premise transforms librarian archetypes through moon-phased books and bamboo creel's embodied paradox. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
