<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Embodied grief avoids therapy-speak ("cloak dripping with sighs"); micro-choices like positioning the atlas page under light reveal hierarchy of values. Slight abstraction in "reaper’s grief was not just personal sorrow" edges toward telling but redeemed by concrete naming acts that earn closure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands impeccably: stars spelling the lover’s name crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost ("stone sang back... promised release"). Accumulative lens holds—each naming intensifies density and reweights stakes without causal breaks; cost proof irrefutable in final resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Observatory’s cracked dome actively constrains tactics (scattered light angle for crystallization), transforming stone pillars into "conduits of luminous memory" that charge the final sanctuary image. Sensory details like "phosphorescent blue" ink filter through Lira’s grief, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lira’s agency: naming each monster narrows options toward the final whisper, with visible cost in "echo of sacrifice pulse louder." Escalation driven by protagonist under Accumulative lens; cost unmistakable as "centuries of unfinished farewells" dissolve into aurora.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete acts (naming Astraeon/Lyrith), not statements. Final constellation image offers non-literal answer to "can nameless fears be named?" by reweighting dread into "distant intimacy," avoiding moralizing while charging prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("stone arches breathing the last amber of day") and rhythmic control under pressure: short phrases during crystallization ("Astraeon—into the night") modulate with emotional intensity. Zero head-hopping; POV consistency anchors the lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("dripping with the sighs of unkept promises" conveys emotion, setting, backstory). Figurative language serves pressure ("terror pulse like a second heart") without muddle. Minor abstraction in "resonance that bound the living to the dead" redeemed by later concrete actions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reaper trope through specific details (phosphorescent atlas, crystallizing ink) and emotional truth in "nameless shadow" of forgotten sailor. Bold lyrical structure risks obscuring stakes but maintains coherence; avoids safety middle with naming-as-release rather than conquest.</comment>
