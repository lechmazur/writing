<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marin’s deafness creates authentic contradiction: feeling vibrations as music while numb. Micro-choices like cradling the needle embody motivation without therapy-speak. Slight over-tidiness in emotional thaw—numbness to revival lacks gritty struggle in pivotal rewinding moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: mirrored hush crystallizes options with visceral cost ("frost dissolving like droplets"). Orientation perfect by line 3; Accumulative lens holds through tactile escalation. Cost unmistakable in marrow-deep pulses against the filament.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cavern walls pulsing with memory actively constrain choices—stone must be touched to feel reversed songs. Petrified drum skin turntable and filament of hush charge the final image. "Wax shells" slightly generic but outweighed by stone’s marrow-resonant specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven solely by Marin’s agency: backward songs deepen pressure, rewinding forces confrontation. Cost legible in "frost under sunrise" dissolution. Single tightening (backward→forward play) perfectly scaled for length under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tactile particulars: "filament of hush" glowing with heartbeat rhythm reweights numbness. Final "symphony of feeling" resonates without moralizing. No thematic echo—wisdom earned via drumhead metaphors and rewound wax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "silence into a shape she could feel" embodies deaf POV. Rhythm varies organically ("splintered like jagged filament of hush"). Minor cliché in "frost of apathy" but consistent psychic distance under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "invisible ribbons" metaphor sustains without muddling. Every sentence propels: "pressure pressed against filament, stretching it like taut rope of feeling." Final line avoids sentimentality through concrete action ("rewound and healed").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms deafness trope via tactile music—silence as "filament" to be rewound. Bold risk in centering non-auditory symphony fully committed. No derivative echoes; drum maker’s cavern feels mythic yet specific through petrified skin and wax mechanics.</comment>
