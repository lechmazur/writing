<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses; motivation clear but interiority leans abstract ("weight of unfinished stories") without visceral struggle during ritual execution. Final renunciation (mask removal) earns cost but micro-choices lack hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: emotion "forever etched in stone" with felt cost ("crystalline chill," mask shattering). Accumulative lens holds—density builds through powder application to lattice formation, reweighting safety/stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Gallery functions as micro-setting: vanishing point forces perspective surrender, powder settles in cracks as constellations. Constraints tactics (mask alignment with powder) but spatial choreography lacks active pressure during key ritual beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through ritual execution: "mirage of safety" dissolves into honest light as powder crystallizes emotion. Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens; cost legible in mask shattering and "bittersweet reminder" of loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image ("powdered whispers and legacy of truth") resonates non-literally with theme—true safety in feeling, not illusion. Avoids moralizing; "somber marvel" crystallizes complex loss/love without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("porcelain shards catching light like broken hopes") sustains under pressure. Minor filter verbs ("feeling the weight") but rhythmic control shines in closure ("shards clink softly, a mournful lullaby").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; high density ("powder's glittering veil" → "delicate lattice"). Slight overwriting in "frozen breaths of lost time" but pattern-taught and payoff justified in crystallization imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms ritual trope via ash scatterer's specific craft; emotional truth in "bittersweet reminder" avoids sentimentality. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without obscuring Charged Poise closure.</comment>
