<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as curiosity advocate is clear but lacks interior contradiction or meaningful struggle; her flawless success undermines earned change. No visible cost or flawed decision-making under pressure weakens character depth despite poetic interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("The quiet has spoken") lands with conceptual cost but causality breaks: window displays magically trigger sapling planting without resistance. Orientation succeeds early but escalation lacks tangible opposition under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid cobalt library mist creates atmosphere but remains decorative backdrop; magnetic grotto functions symbolically yet fails to constrain choices or charge final image. Sensory details impress but lack tactical pressure required for 9+ band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (curiosity vs. rote learning) is declared but never tested—zero obstacles or trade-offs. Rebellion succeeds frictionlessly; conceptual cost (shifted town mindset) feels asserted rather than viscerally earned through narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through window displays as "city-wide language," avoiding moralizing. Final image ("gardeners of thoughts") resonates non-literally but sapling planting borders on abstraction, slightly diluting earned complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("hearing unspoken words in rustle of pages") shines with rhythmic control. Minor register drift in "humble rebellion" phrasing and occasional overwriting ("dust danced like quiet fireflies") prevent 9+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong propulsion with clean grammar but scaffolded abstractions ("forest of second thoughts") and one paraphrase loop ("quiet revolution"/"quiet storm") dull closure's charge. Final paragraph's thematic echo narrowly avoids severe penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess as communal metaphor for curiosity avoids cliché through specific sapling/window mechanics. Emotional truth elevated by "magnetic grotto" symbolism, though rebellion's frictionless victory limits risk-taking depth.</comment>
