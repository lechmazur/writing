<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear motivation but interiority remains abstract; lacks contradictory impulses in peak beats despite embodied grief cues like "copper-stained fingers." Diagnostic "curtains of intention" concept overrides character-particular struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Valid Charged Poise closure with legible cost ("tears not sad but grateful"), but two non-closure issues (abstract motivation escalation, momentum drag in crane-folding sequence) trigger -1.5 Accumulation Cap from 8.8 base.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Observatory functions as micro-setting; vellum stencil and origami cranes constrain choices (tracing coordinates) and charge final image ("folds waiting to be opened"), though environment lacks active pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency (folding/placing cranes) reweights dominant stake with legible emotional cost; pressure deepens via Accumulative lens but stakes remain slightly abstract rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Final image ("every ending was merely a fold") reweights prior material without moralizing; earned resonance through concrete crane/rose mechanics avoids thematic echo despite "genuinely artificial" near-miss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct "genuinely artificial" lexicon sustains under pressure; rhythmic control in pivotal moments ("knelt, fingers stained") with no head-hopping, though reflective passages risk BRR limits.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("genuinely artificial" repetition) and template cadence in middle beats, but no closure artifacts; high density maintained through resonant image compression.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mourning trope via observatory logic and origami mechanics; emotional truth in "tears not sad but grateful" avoids cliché while "subdued ardor" risks mid-band hedging.</comment>
