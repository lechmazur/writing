<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("resignation and fragile curiosity") drives micro-choices like tincture adjustments; embodied emotion via "heart surged with quiet triumph" avoids labels. Final renunciation of hopelessness earns closure through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost ("weight of hopelessness lift") under Accumulative lens. Penny-drop rhythm tightens pressure meaningfully; final glow reconfigures destiny with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ember nexus constrains choices as tincture base ("grinding ash into powder") and evolves into dawn, charging closure. Sensory details filtered through alchemist’s bias ("each droplet a silent promise").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (interrupting destiny) tightens through successive tincture adjustments. Agency-driven escalation with visible cost ("hopelessness lift") forecloses predetermined path via crozier’s revival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action ("creative destruction" as method, not statement). Final image reweights "broken things can bloom anew" without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "cold to the touch" flame.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("trembling hue mirrors frozen bloom") with rhythmic control. Compression during high-pressure beats ("Nothing sparked...") taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor synonym churn in "frozen bloom" repetitions; filter verbs ("he sensed") justified by contemplative mood. Zero loops in closure beat; final line avoids overwriting with concrete propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tropes transformed via specific mechanics (penny-drop timing, cold flame). Emotional truth in "hopeless alchemist" forging change; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
