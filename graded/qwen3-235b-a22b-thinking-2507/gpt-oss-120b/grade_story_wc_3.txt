<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (preservation vs. new purpose) shown through embodied actions like tracing grooves and recording fluctuations; "haunted ambitions" backstory anchors motivation but lacks concrete mistakes that compound, slightly thinning emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly with visible cost ("distance between her and the spirit close to a touching point"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through magnetic resonance patterns, though valley journey transition lacks causal weight in final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Magnetic arbor actively constrains choices (frequencies as experimental variables) and charges closure via "roots sinking into magnetic bark"; iron-kissed leaves and silver particles directly enable the proof of transition physics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lira's agency: seed planting proves theory, narrowing options to valley journey; cost is legible in spirit's departure and "calm after the storm of ambition," perfectly scaling to length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (knowledge fruit growth = ambition cultivation), avoiding moralizing; final line reweights "haunted ambitions" as "shared enlightenment" without stating morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("wind whisper ancient codes," frequency-based observation) modulates with emotional intensity; minor academic drift in "physics of transition" risks POV lexicon but stays character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops in closure beats, but template cadence in "She had spent decades... Now, with the spirit..." and "She remembered... Now, the ladder..." slightly dulls momentum in reflection block.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms cuneiform translation tropes via magnetic botany; "knowledge fruit" mechanics feel inevitable through glyph-to-pulse mapping, avoiding quirkiness with profession-specific logic.</comment>
