<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Anara's contradictory impulses (tradition vs insurgency) drive choices, but her "insurgent" identity lacks concrete friction; the memory sacrifice earns closure but feels abstract without deeper emotional layering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with memory sacrifice cost, but the kite's coincidental discovery weakens causal escalation; lens holds as Accumulative/Textural with sensory density shift at unsealing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Volcanic springs constrain every choice (kite retrieval, unsealing ritual) and charge the final image; steam/moss details evolve with plot pressure, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("evolve tradition") tightens via decoding/unsealing, but elder's off-page warning dilutes on-page pressure; memory sacrifice provides cost yet stakes remain conceptually abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (kite decoding, vine cradle), avoiding moralizing; "implanted destiny as invitation" reweights tradition organically without stated morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("moss sang back in hushed green whispers") modulates under pressure; minor register drift in "implanted destiny" explanation slightly dilutes voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>No fatal artifacts, but "amber cracked, a golden light spilled" suffers from sequential simultaneity error; high density in ritual beats compensates for isolated scaffold phrasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms grandmother archetype through telepathic botany and volcanic setting; risk-taking in quiet closure (collective heartbeat) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
