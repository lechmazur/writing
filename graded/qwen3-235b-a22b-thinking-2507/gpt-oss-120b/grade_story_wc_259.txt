<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract ("mind steadily unpredictable") with diagnostic label-speak in peak beats; emotions labeled ("anguished joy") without embodied contradiction. Final choice lacks visible cost beyond generic "heavy heart," failing micro-choice under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with legible cost ("heart heavy yet uplifted"), lens (Accumulative/Textural) held via pattern-break escalation. Minor flaw: escalation lacks concrete price paid during attempt, weakening stakes depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bronze prism pagoda constrains choice (pattern avoidance) and charges final image as "beacon," meeting 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency, with floor echoes evolving causally to alter tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency (deliberate missteps) reweights stake through density increase, but cost remains abstract emotional weight without visible tradeoff (e.g., injury, time loss) during the attempt phase.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action ("purification is... transformation"), final image reweights "atoms of nostalgia" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo but minor abstraction ("reclaiming heritage") slightly dilutes resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("walls breathed a sigh of anguished joy") with rhythmic control; minor register drift ("steadily unpredictable" abstraction) disrupts POV lexicon during climax tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density but "prismatic shards" repetition creates synonym churn; "smiled through tears" cliché dulls closure image. No artifacts in final beat, avoiding severe penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tropes transformed through specific voice ("saffron-veil," "steady unpredictability"), but bronze prism pagoda feels derivative. Risk-taking in accumulative structure elevates emotional truth without gimmickry.</comment>
