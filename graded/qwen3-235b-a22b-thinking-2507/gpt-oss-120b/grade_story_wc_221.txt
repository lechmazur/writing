<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority feels authentic in moments ("confusion melt into quiet resolve"), but motivation lacks contradictory impulses; the "blessed pariah" status remains abstract without embodied struggle against its constraints during pivotal choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise when the compass needle shifts true north within dilated time, with visible cost in enduring the "blank map" reality; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds as sensory density peaks during the star-sketching vision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The gilded compass rose functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (aligning sketches) and charging the final image; "time dilation observation deck" evolves from static backdrop to pliable canvas that actively shapes the ritual’s outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen when the temporal field enables the glimpse, narrowing options to ritual continuation; cost is legible in the "confusion melt into quiet resolve" shift, though the dominant stake (direction amid loss) lacks visceral escalation beyond thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the compass’s dual inward/outward pull, reweighting "true north" as both ancestral memory and self-navigation; avoids moralizing by letting the pulsing constellation map embody hope without explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "minutes stretched like taffy" and "charcoal bearing ash scent" sustains voice under pressure; rhythmic control elevates the vision sequence without disrupting the accumulative lens or diluting emotional weight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; "smear of violet and ash" and "pulse like a heartbeat" achieve high density without figurative muddle; minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" phrasing barely touches closure’s lyrical propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms apocalypse tropes via time-dilation ritual specificity; the "blank map" synthesis feels inevitable, though risk-taking (temporal mechanics) lacks deeper integration with emotional stakes beyond surface metaphor.</comment>
