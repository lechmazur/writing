<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "splinters into bridges" epiphany, but flaws lack visible struggle; scars signal growth without showing active resistance to learning. Micro-choices like slide placement feel motivated yet lack layered conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise where the compass sculpture makes "learning never ends" legible with cost (scars as earned endurance), but turbine-hum sync with heartbeat feels coincidental rather than earned escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Driftwood functions as micro-setting: natural scars constrain carving choices, and the archway’s "stone shifting like grain" charges the final image where wood "whispers new possibilities," fulfilling 9+ gate through tactile constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Mira’s agency as she reimagines the archway, narrowing options from solitary craft to communal reflection; cost is visible in scars and "endless tide of learning," though turbine sync slightly softens pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "splinters into bridges" metaphor—concrete actions (carving knots, child vision) reweight learning as perpetual process without moralizing; final compass image resonates as non-literal answer to "how learning never ends."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "palms smelling of salt and pine" and "turbine-hum reverie" modulates with emotional intensity; consistent psychic distance avoids head-hopping, though repeated "reverie" phrasing slightly dilutes rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose excels with "weathered throat" metaphors and purposeful fragments, but "turbine-hum reverie" repeats verbatim three times, creating paraphrase loops that dull closure momentum despite strong cadence elsewhere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms driftwood sculpting through "timewoven alliances" lens—concrete scars and lantern mechanics avoid abstraction; risks lyrical density yet maintains emotional truth, though "magic" element borders on convenient without deeper world logic.</comment>
