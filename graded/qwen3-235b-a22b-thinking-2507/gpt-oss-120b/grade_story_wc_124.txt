<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via embodied scent triggers (lavender/tears) and micro-choices (checking oil lamp scent before blooms), but the epiphany lacks visible struggle—grief shifts too smoothly from mother to "every fragment of history" without authentic resistance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: sealing the vial with copper embodies Earned Stasis ("profound peace" after tears), with conceptual cost ("grief transformed into a lantern") legible in the final image. Accumulative lens holds as scent layers reweight memory’s "living current" with escalating density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Greenhouse setting actively constrains choices (UV light enables revelation) and charges closure—"crystal shadows cling to his coat" reweights extinct flora as silent witnesses. Micro-setting triumph: the vial’s copper seal becomes a tactile symbol of transformed grief.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen organically as scent collage shifts from personal (mother’s death) to universal ("every fragment of history"), narrowing Arlen’s goal to cataloging sorrow. Cost is visceral: tears for lost cities, yet the escalation lacks friction—no active resistance to his new mission weakens the trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment>Theme emerges purely through sensory accumulation ("petrichor blending with perfume"), avoiding moralizing. Final image—"lantern that might teach how tears were born"—resonates as non-literal answer to the central question, with extinction’s fragility underscoring memory’s fragility without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exquisite: Arlen’s scent-based noticing ("ozone after a storm," "sweet decay of old paper") filters all description. But voice slightly overreaches in climax ("grief transformed into a lantern of understanding")—a hairline slip into abstraction that dilutes earlier precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet controlled ("vapor curled around dead petals, filament catching UV glow"), but "collage of moments" phrasing risks thematic echo. Near-closure density stumbles: "delicate dance of memory and scent" verges on cliché, slightly dulling the final image’s charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes through hyper-specific sensory alchemy (oil lamps on coat, copper-sealed vial). Freshness lies in treating scent as historical archive—extinct orchids "speaking through aroma" avoids sentimentality by grounding universality in petrified leaves.</comment>
