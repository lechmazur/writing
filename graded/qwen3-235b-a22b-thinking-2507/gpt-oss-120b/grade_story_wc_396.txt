<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Limited interior contradiction; "calmly intuitive" trait is stated but not tested through embodied micro-choices under pressure. Strength lies in consistent sensory perception ("steps echoing like a ticking metronome"), but emotional progression lacks visceral contradiction beyond implied resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (world breathing in unison) with legible cost ("weight of unspoken hopes pressing against the ice"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, though the "ancient method" introduction risks convenient resolution despite anchoring in dusty manuscript.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lighthouse orchard functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (frost-bound steps echoing metronome) and charges the final image (blossoming leaves). Ice floes actively pressure the scene by shifting, making environment indispensable to closure’s renewal theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconstituting wholeness) tightens through mirror sequence, but cost remains abstract ("weight of unspoken hopes") without tangible forfeiture. Escalation via protagonist’s alignment of shards feels earned, yet lacks concrete trade-off beyond emotional resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "courageous anomaly" reweighted by final image (shared understanding). Avoids moralizing, but "map empathy onto action" risks thematic echo; saved by concrete execution (child reaching shard) rather than abstract assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lantern casting wavering glow on frosted roots") and rhythmic control under pressure. Minor filter-verb accumulation ("she felt," "she sensed") in high-stakes beats slightly dulls immediacy without breaking coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful imagery, but figurative strings risk muddle in restoration beat ("scattering into a thousand specks... mirrors sighed"). Template cadence in mirror descriptions ("Another mirror showed...") triggers minor momentum drag without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Synthesizes lighthouse/ice tropes through specific "lighthouse orchard" logic and anomaly-as-renewal. Transformation test passed: plot fails with generic setting; emotional specificity ("child trembling in cold") avoids abstraction. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
