<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses; priest's unwavering ritual shows embodied emotion but no internal conflict under pressure. "Soul might be consumed" threat remains abstract, not dramatized through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully: "stillness shattered" exposes "hidden assumptions" with felt cost (soul consumption risk). Accumulative lens holds through resonant spiral to indigo flare, reconfiguring the city's reality with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dimensional anchor functions as micro-setting that charges the final image ("anchor steadied, its pull no longer a threat"). Cathedral's silence actively constrains action ("muted reverence"), but indigo palette lacks tangible interaction beyond symbolic spilling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes ("possession completes") lack operational tension; the "clock of possession" isn't a live constraint altering tactics. Pressure accumulates texturally through looping resonance rather than protagonist agency narrowing options under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "exposing hidden assumptions that shackled the city's heart" reweights the indigo ritual without moralizing. Final image ("bathed the world in calm resolve") resonates as earned answer to "what is louder than a scream in vacuum?" avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "resonant currents," "silence decorated the cathedral" reflect priest's sonic worldview. Rhythmic control shines in looping pedal descriptions, though indigo fixation borders on repetitive. No head-hopping; lyric compression taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in adjacent metaphors ("rhetorical devices that dripped like honey," "each phrase was a mirror") slightly muddles high-pressure beats. Otherwise, vivid propulsion: "sound looped back upon itself" crystallizes tension with zero redundancy in closure sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms ritual tropes through specific sonic mechanics (loop pedal as rosary, indigo as heartbeat). Fresh synthesis: "muffled clarity of truth reverberate through their bones" avoids abstraction. Risks poetic density without sacrificing coherence or closure charge.</comment>
