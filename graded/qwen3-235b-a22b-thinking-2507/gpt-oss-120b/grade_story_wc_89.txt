<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract ("yearning," "tremor of change") without contradictory impulses in action; "reluctant metamorphosis" told not shown through micro-choices under pressure. No visible tradeoffs for "paradoxically steady" trait beyond label repetition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with legible cost (bark patterns), but escalation under Accumulative lens lacks density increase—ritual proceeds procedurally without narrowing options or deepening pressure before the stag's appearance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory tapestry, yet orchard setting functions as backdrop without constraining choices; moonlight permanence fails to pressure tactics. Micro-setting potential (spices) underutilized despite humming jars.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reforging bond) remains abstractly declared; no meaningful tightening—ritual executes flawlessly without viscerally tested stakes or protagonist-driven escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Thematic echo dominates final paragraph ("true magic was cosmic intimacy"), violating organic emergence; tidy resolution ("humble tribute to rebirth") replaces earned ambiguity with moralizing closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose overflows with ornamental description ("luminous grove," "filament of starlight"), diluting perceptual signature; repetitive syntax ("She moved... She had... She gathered...") creates drumbeat rhythm under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("paradoxically steady" reused), template cadence in ritual sequence, and mixed metaphors ("space thinned to filament of shared breath") dull closure image; artifacts pervasive in final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Derivative premise (magical reunion ritual) lacks fresh inflection; emotional resolution too neat, avoiding authentic struggle. Tropes (phoenix, fortune cookie) deployed generically without transformation.</comment>
