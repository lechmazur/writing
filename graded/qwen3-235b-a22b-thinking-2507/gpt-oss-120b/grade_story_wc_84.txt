<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "perpetually surprised" trait is stated but doesn't drive micro-choices under pressure. Final endurance feels earned yet motivation remains abstract without tangible cost scaling to length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("harmony coaxed from cosmos"), but causal links between star trails and chip activation lack motivation. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds though causality thinness caps score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory setting actively constrains action (marble star trails guiding drone), with "brilliant dimness" charging the final image. Micro-setting (matrix chip's copper veins) directly shapes the climax by demanding precise drone positioning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (assembling "missing pieces") lacks tangible escalation; pressure rises through lyrical accumulation but cost remains conceptual. Agency in pulling lever is clear, yet no live option foreclosed or tactical shift occurs during the beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (star trails, chip resonance), avoiding moralizing. Final image ("night sky stitched with fresh star trails") offers non-literal answer to belonging, though "pulse of every living star" risks thematic echo in closing beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("visor reflecting constellations," drone's "whispering rotors"), with rhythmic control modulating under pressure. Zero head-hopping; lyric compression taught early via "brilliant dimness" paradox pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "perpetually surprised" repetitions dulls momentum. Otherwise, high density ("crystal prism shimmer like distant sunrise trapped inside stone") avoids muddle, though "last sigh of day" borders on stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone tech and ancient observatory avoids trope through specific execution (type foundry matrix chip). Emotional truth in "collaborative pulse of human curiosity" elevates beyond surface novelty, though pilgrim archetype limits risk.</comment>
