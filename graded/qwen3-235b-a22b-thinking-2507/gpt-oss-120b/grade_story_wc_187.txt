<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear but static; no authentic internal conflict or evolving tradeoffs beyond labeled 'preemptive nostalgia'. Final endurance unearned as no struggle precedes resolve. Strength: embodied grief for unlived moments ('feeling grief for moments not yet lived'). Weakness: identity sculpting lacks friction despite 'weight of centuries' pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (realizing conjecture bridges past/future) with felt cost (nostalgia→resolve). Lens ambiguity early (causal hints vs. accumulative payoff) slightly undermines escalation. Strength: 'fog thickened... lanterns flickered' tightens pressure under accumulative lens. Weakness: no meaningful mid-scene deepening beyond environmental shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Crystal and shadows constrain choices (tracing noon shadow to resonance point) and charge final image ('shadows remained, each line a quiet testament'). Strength: 'solid fog' physically alters shadow measurements, making setting causally active. Weakness: 'pale marble' simile feels generic amid otherwise precise texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes (sculpting identity from memory) signaled early but pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation; fog/shadow shifts complicate but don't narrow his options. Cost legible ('preemptive nostalgia turn[ing] into steady resolve') yet feels atmospheric rather than earned through struggle. Strength: coherent accumulative tightening via deepening hush. Weakness: passive observation dominates over active choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: 'identity... forever be a collage of shared memory' reweights shadow/crystal motifs without moralizing. Strength: final image (shadows as 'quiet testament') answers 'how societies retain pasts' through geometry. Weakness: 'collective memory' named too abstractly early on. Meets 9+ gate but capped per high-band entry (Q4<8.2).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ('feathered pen tip humming with latent histories') and rhythmic control ('mind deepened into a hush, each breath a softer echo'). Strength: syntax compresses under pressure ('He recorded... noting...'). Weakness: 'preemptively nostalgic' diction feels authorial, not character-bound. Meets 9+ quick test despite minor register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Synonym loops ('solid fog... translucent slab... pale marble') and template cadence ('He began... He moved... He recorded') dull momentum in critical beats. Strength: 'stormlit hall seemed to inhale the clouds' shows textural specificity. Weakness: 'deepening hush settled like dust' muddles closure metaphor. Text-artifact penalty (-0.7) applied for final-third density issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory as geometric pattern (shadows mapping collective echoes) avoids abstraction through crystal/obelisk mechanics. Strength: 'examining shadow lengths' transforms trope into active ritual. Weakness: 'collective memory' concept lacks radical reinvention. Risk-taking (textural structure) heightens stakes but emotional specificity prevents gimmickry.</comment>
