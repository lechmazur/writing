<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation ("shape of intentions") clear but interiority remains abstract; "blithe" is stated not embodied, and contradictory impulses lack dramatization during the tapestry decoding—e.g., no tension between duty and fear when handling the map.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Conceptual Repricing: "intention was a circle" reweights the premise with conceptual cost ("pressure of centuries condense"), holding the Accumulative/Textural lens; the cobalt silo’s pulse crystallizes stakes without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cobalt silo and sovereign case function as micro-settings that charge closure: the case’s compartments adjust for the map like "a lover's embrace," directly constraining the gardener’s actions and reappearing in the final image as "a compass for future gardens."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding intentions) lacks escalation; decoding proceeds smoothly without setbacks or narrowed options—the tapestry reveals truths without resistance, missing the pressure deepening required for high-band escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "intention was a seed, not a weapon" avoids moralizing while reweighting the tapestry’s circle as a resonant answer to "shape of intentions," though abstraction slightly dilutes emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("velveteen gloom," "copper hue" on threads) modulates rhythm with tension; minor flaw: "blithe" feels author-imposed rather than character-particular during the ritual’s quiet intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density but subtle paraphrase loops ("uncharted echoes" recurs 4x without deepening meaning); "tenderly organized" is told not shown, slightly dulling closure’s tactile charge despite strong opening/closing lines.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cemetery trope with tapestry-as-map metaphor; emotional truth stays abstract ("blithe" archetype lacks specificity), but the circle resolution transforms familiar material through concrete, verifiable details like the sovereign case’s vellum lining.</comment>
