<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority leans on abstract labels ("storm of loss," "fragile trust") rather than embodied contradiction; the pivotal meteorite-sliver attachment shows alignment with motivation but lacks specific micro-choices under pressure that would elevate it beyond poetic assertion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with felt cost ("inevitable wilt of memory") under Accumulative/Textural lens; density builds through dust-pigeon-map integration, though the community humming resolution edges toward coincidence rather than earned causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Attic micro-setting constrains choice (dust mapping under skylight) and charges the final image (glowing map); recurring meteorite chip evolves from discovery to fragmented delivery device, making environment indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through accumulating paper trails, but escalation relies on external validation (community humming) rather than protagonist agency; the "wilt of memory" cost is legible yet the resolution softens pressure via coincidental chorus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "moss blooming over stone" reframing reinvention as layering, avoiding moralizing; final image reweights loss/renewal without abstraction, though "lost songs" phrasing occasionally drifts toward vagueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust turned to gold," "withering grace") with rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping, but abstract terms like "fragile trust" slightly dilute embodied POV during key decisions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, though "believed that preserving these trails could echo lost songs" edges into telling; final line’s abstraction ("balance and memory can coexist") is redeemed by the concrete glowing map image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pigeon training, meteorite, and dust motes avoids quirkiness; "paper trails" as literal/digital hybrid feels inevitable, though "reinventing history" premise borders on familiar without deeper transformation of the trope.</comment>
