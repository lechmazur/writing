<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("weighty lightness") without embodied contradiction; micro-choices like narrating tasks lack tension. Strengths in craft-specific perception ("edges frayed like cracked surface") but emotional progression feels over-tidy despite strong motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "abandon the illusion of control" crystallizes stakes with visible cost (bookmark as compass). Orientation anchors by line 5, but escalation lacks meaningful tightening until final paragraph where Mara’s realization reconfigures options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice and glass function as micro-setting that charges closure: meltwater pools like "liquid glass" directly constrains Mara’s work, and the furnace’s glow on panels creates the kaleidoscope payoff. Environment actively shapes tactics (vials storing melt fractions), avoiding ornamental description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (crafting safe zones) is clear early, but conflict lacks tangible pressure escalation—no moment where thawing ice actively threatens her work. The "abandon illusion of control" turn deepens stakes conceptually, but cost remains felt rather than viscerally dramatized until the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete craft metaphors without moralizing; the final image ("kaleidoscope of colors that seemed to laugh") reweights the premise non-literally. Avoids sentimentality by grounding "thawing heart" in glass vials and bookmark, with no thematic echo in closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("silica into life," "meltwater pooled like liquid glass") with rhythmic control in task narration. Minor register drift in "weighty lightness" repetitions, but compression (e.g., "narrated the task: ‘I lift the rod...’") teaches its pattern and pays off in liturgical closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity ("creases catching a sliver of sunrise") but scaffold issues: "weighty lightness" repeats 4x, and template cadence in task narration ("I lift... I breathe...") creates minor loops. No figurative muddle in peak beats, though "frozen veins opened like veins of glass" strains cohesion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of climate crisis through glassblower’s craft avoids disaster tropes; "safe zones for inquiry" angle feels urgent and specific. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off, but some familiar beats (abandoned tech) prevent 9.0+. Transformation test passed via Mara’s tactile methods.</comment>
