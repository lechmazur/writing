<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "staying while leaving" duality, but the abandoned friend backstory lacks embodied cost in present action, reducing epiphany stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (mirror reflection), but the attic-to-library transition lacks causal motivation under Accumulative lens despite strong final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cobblestones and oak desk constrain choices (hiding invitation), while market/library duality charges the sunrise resolution; only minor vagueness in "dimension stitched between shadows."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the recluse's internal agency as he interprets nested paradoxes, with visible cost in his transformed perspective; "within arm's reach of midnight" lacks tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the mirror's whisper ("to hide it was to deny the very heart"), avoiding moralizing; "nested paradoxes" occasionally drifts toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cobblestones whispered history") modulates with tension, but "enlarged tranquility" recurs with slight thematic echo risk in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong rhythm and specificity marred by minor synonym loops ("humming with hidden dialogues"/"volumes humming with riddles") and two "enlarged tranquility" repetitions diluting climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms recluse/library tropes through market facade and "staying while leaving" synthesis; risk-taking in conceptual closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
