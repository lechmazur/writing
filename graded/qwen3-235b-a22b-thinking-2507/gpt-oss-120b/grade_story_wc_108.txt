<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("trembling certainty") and embodied fear ("heart pounded louder than explosions") drive choices, but "the betrayal of the self I had hidden" slips into diagnostic label-speak during peak pressure, undermining authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Earned Stasis via lever step with conceptual cost ("vulnerability is power"), but constellations rearranging into her name backwards strains the causal lens as unearned coincidence rather than motivated escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rusted library functions as micro-setting: shelves' "rusted bones" constrain movement during lever step, and dust cascade directly alters tactics; stars' constellations charge final image with identity theme through physical pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully as decoding method (stunt moves as cipher keys) narrows options, but library's near-collapse resolution lacks sufficient visible cost—the "cascade of dust" feels underweighted against the vial's demanded "confession."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (amber fire in veins, lever step), avoiding moralizing; however, "every betrayal can be turned into a beacon" risks thematic echo by stating the central question rather than reweighting it through the final action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct stunt-double lexicon ("backflips for circles") creates perceptual signature, but "firmly adaptive" repetition in high-stress beats forms a scaffold loop, and final paragraph's "hovered on the edge of the universe" shifts into unearned lyrical register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dense figurative language ("spilling a single silver thread that unspooled into a scroll") muddles the pivotal decoding sequence, triggering tightened penalties for coherence in a high-pressure beat despite strong opening texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stunt craft and mythic transformation (child's cast as cipher medium) elevates tropes, but leviathan heart remains derivative without sufficient grounding in Mara's specific vulnerability beyond symbolic convenience.</comment>
