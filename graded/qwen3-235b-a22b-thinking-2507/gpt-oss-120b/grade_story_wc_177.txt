<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction under pressure is absent; epiphany feels unearned despite clear motivation. "Precisely playful" trait remains label-only without constraining choices during storm escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost but cost proof fails—no on-page sentence shows sacrifice. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, yet storm pressure never concretely tightens tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vine-draped bunker micro-setting charges the final image as vines "stretch outward" to welcome travelers. Sensory details like "phosphorescent spores" constrain choice by guiding the trail, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (paths choosing walkers) deepens via interpreted dreams, but storm pressure remains atmospheric rather than viscerally felt. No visible price paid until final image, weakening escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through "paths listen, they decide" reconfiguration. Avoids moralizing but secondary "beauty in wreckage" insight edges toward pseudo-profundity without concrete grounding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "luminous trail" and "ethereal grit" descriptions. Rhythmic control shines in storm climax, though "precisely playful" repetition strains lexicon consistency under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Ethereal grit seep into her bones" triggers therapy-speak label penalty. Template cadence in bunker descriptions (-0.4) and synonym churn ("mournful yet mischievously hopeful") dull closure momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "paths as sentient filaments" transforms tropes, but "wafer seal" object risks derivativeness. Bold structural choice in temporal transcendence heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
