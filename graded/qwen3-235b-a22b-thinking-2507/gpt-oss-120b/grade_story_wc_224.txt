<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied ("pain was a clue," "shards of doubt") with contradictory impulses (fear vs. curiosity driving feather use), though "buried talents" risks abstraction without sufficient flaw manifestation during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully ("shape of home became a melody") with undeniable cost in shattered memory; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density escalation (feather strokes → corridor revelation) and coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Mountain setting actively constrains choices (stone's vibration through "marrow," breathing stone ribs) and charges closure; "pine resin and old ink" sensory hierarchy perfectly reflects Lira's urgency and bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency (pressing feather despite pain), narrowing options toward realization; cost ("image shattered like glass") is visceral and conceptually reweights home as resonance, not place.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "maps of feeling" and final melody image, avoiding moralizing; slight overreliance on "shape of home" risks abstraction, but earned by concrete feather-stone mechanics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("liquid metal" eyes, "feather light as a sigh") with rhythmic control during tension; non-standard semicolons and fragmented cadence teach lyric pattern early, paid off in closure's "silence of daylight."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; "vellum that pulsed with thunder" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor deduction for "buried talents" (abstract phrasing) but redeemed by immediate concrete action ("pressed the feather deeper").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specific mechanics (feather texture as translation method); emotional truth in "home as resonance" avoids genericity, with mountain's breathing closure feeling inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
