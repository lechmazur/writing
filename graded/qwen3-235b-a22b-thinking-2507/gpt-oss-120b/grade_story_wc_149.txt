<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ghost bride's motivation to repay debt is clear and embodied through actions (placing bead, releasing sigh), with visible cost in dissolution. Contradictory impulses (longing vs. duty) surface in key beats but interiority leans poetic over deeply particularized under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost (her fading into ash), and Accumulative lens holds through resonant awakenings tightening the debt-repayment stakes. Minor deduction: debt mechanics remain abstract despite visceral sensory escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The carved stone bead functions as micro-setting object that constrains choices (placement on branches) and charges the final image (pulsing amber light). Sensory details are purposefully selective, with frost and alchemy evolving causally to mirror internal stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency as bead placements narrow options toward the fatal sigh, with cost unmistakable in her dissolution. Debt-repayment stake tightens through textural density, though the "final payment" mechanism lacks concrete friction before climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: the orchard's "mournful elation" reweights debt repayment as eternal resonance, avoiding moralizing. Final image (bead pulsing with promise) offers non-literal answer to redemption without stating a moral, fulfilling CR closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ash that clung to her shoulders as if grieving the sun") shows selective POV bias, with rhythmic control tightening under pressure ("sigh that tasted of roses and rust"). Minor deduction: "lovingly venomous" repetition edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion through concrete verbs ("coaxed dormant roots," "soil drank"). Figurative language maintains coherence ("liquid amber"), though high-density metaphors in early beats risk ornamental dilution without full payoff in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope via alchemical specificity (resonant awakenings, bead sigils) and emotional truth in tender/fatal duality. Risk-taking heightens stakes through "mournful elation" synthesis, with closure feeling inevitable through prior particulars.</comment>
