<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "wryly earnest" pursuit and embodied "haggard awe" elevates beyond stock grief, but micro-choices lack concrete tradeoffs; the exchange feels fated rather than earned by prior causality under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: mist preserving colors charges the cost of surrendered paintings, but the "island exhaled" anthropomorphism slightly softens the felt cost in the final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rain trails function as micro-setting that constrains choices (slipping on algae) and charges the final image (mist as varnish), with sensory specificity ("salt-slick stones," "serpentine path") avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (art for convergence) tightens via the exchange, but the cost of surrendered paintings feels abstract when Mara immediately paints the convergence; stakes lack visceral escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through rain trails as conduits of memory without moralizing, though "true compass was her own pursuit" edges toward thematic echo but avoids final-paragraph sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("flicker of candlelight as clue") and rhythmic control in high-pressure beats; lyrical compression taught early pays off in the convergence's "trembling note of hope" without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops and high density, but "haggard awe" risks label-only feeling; elevated diction ("serpentine path," "unearthed convergence") stays within POV lexicon without muddling the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes through specific "convergence" mechanics and tidal island constraints; the brooch-as-compass risks familiarity but gains freshness via rain trails as memory conduits.</comment>
