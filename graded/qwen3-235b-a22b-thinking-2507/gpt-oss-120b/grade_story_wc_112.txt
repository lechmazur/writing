<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear motivation but shallow interiority; "obliging" trait lacks contradiction under pressure. No meaningful internal conflict beyond professional focus, though lever-pull choice aligns with goal. Embodied detail ("mechanically warm hands") anchors emotion but epiphany feels unearned without struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds toward Charged Poise closure. Cost legible in crew's altered perception ("icy warmth... chilling and comforting"). Orientation clear by line 1, but lens ambiguity early (causal vs. textural) slightly weakens escalation coherence despite strong final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choice: aviary stillness enables experiment, turbines sync heartbeat with station. "Holographic lattice" functions as micro-setting charging closure. Sensory details (bioluminescent vines, steel beams) evolve causally with events, avoiding static description. Final image reweights environment as "living organism."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving temporal drift) signaled immediately. Escalation via textural deepening: hum → amber arcs → unfurling buds. Cost is conceptual (altered worldview), but stakes remain abstract—no personal risk beyond professional validation. Agency clear but pressure lacks visceral urgency despite poetic intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through flora/birds: time's sideways movement reweights "subdued awakenings" as ongoing state. Final image ("station to breathe in its own quiet awakenings") offers non-literal resolution without moralizing. Slight thematic echo early ("time moves sideways" stated baldly) but redeemed by earned sensory payoff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Lira's sensory focus on textures ("frozen strings," "icy warmth") reflects her mechanical role. Voice modulates effectively from clinical ("magnetic nexus") to lyrical ("feeling both freeze and soothe"). Minor register drift in "coax the right signal" slightly jars POV's technical lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong rhythm in climax ("amber arcs... illuminating chambers") but synonym loops ("soft, otherworldly glow" → "soft glow" later) and repetitive "subdued awakenings" reduce density. "Mechanically warm" lacks functional connection to lever mechanics. Final image clarity preserved despite minor scaffold in reflective passages.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms sci-fi tropes: "time moves sideways" embodied through xenobiology (flora unfurling sideways). Risk-taking in textural escalation pays off with coherent closure. Fresh synthesis in "icy warmth" paradox charging final image, though "sky mechanic" verges on cliché without deeper occupational specificity.</comment>
