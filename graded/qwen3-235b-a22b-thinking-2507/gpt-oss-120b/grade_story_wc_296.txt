<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "warlike serenity" functions as label-only motivation without visible struggle. Seed's hunger shift demonstrates earned change but micro-choices under pressure remain underdeveloped beyond the final amulet retrieval.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost (seed's inward hunger), but the Accumulative/Textural lens falters mid-scene where vortex mechanics lack causal linkage to the druid's chant. Cost proof weakens at "shards melt onto her palm."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Swirling orchard vortex functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (bending trees during entry) and charges the final image (unwinding circles). Sensory specificity in "frost-rimmed eyes" and "hungry green glow" avoids tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unbending confession) tightens via chant's expanding rings, but pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation; the vortex's surrender feels coincidental rather than earned by the druid's actions. Cost remains conceptual without tactical consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truth emerges through "shards like silver birds" and seed's transformation, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("mirror that finally reflects truths beneath") reweights the premise non-literally, though "warlike serenity" terminology risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "branches twisting into water" and "calm blade ready for battle" sustains Accumulative rhythm. Purposeful compression in confession-shattering sequence taught early pays off, though "frost-rimmed eyes" repeats visual motif excessively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Figurative muddle in "sword unsheathed in peace" (9.3%) and paraphrase loop ("swirling orchard vortex"/"radiant garden of possibility") dulls closure. Strong propulsion in chant sequence but "hungry green glow" stock phrasing triggers -0.3.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "flesh-eating seed as truth guardian" transforms horror tropes, but "cursed lake" setting relies on familiar archetypes. Emotional truth in lost amulet recovery compensates for derivative "frost-rimmed druid" surface.</comment>
