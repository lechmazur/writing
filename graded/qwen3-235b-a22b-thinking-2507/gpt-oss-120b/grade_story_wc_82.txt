<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction absent; grief portrayed as singular force without competing impulses. Micro-choices (polishing gems) lack value hierarchy—no visible trade-offs during ritual. "Raw grief into luminous threads" triggers diagnostic label-speak penalty in peak beats. Strength: embodied sorrow in "luminous torment fills the air" avoids abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost in "heart that ascends while descending," but escalation lacks pressure tightening under Accumulative lens. Cost proof fails: "grief begins to dissolve" lacks concrete on-page price—no forfeiture or adaptation. Shadow detachment triggers action but doesn't narrow options. Orientation clear by para 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tea garden's jasmine steam and dew-slick stone create vivid atmosphere but never constrain choices—polishing could occur anywhere. Glass basilica charges final image ("translucent gold") yet supplies no resources or pressure during climax. Micro-setting (sapphire gem) is handled but static; fails 9+ gate by not shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transforming grief) signaled early, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven deepening. Pressure comes from natural phenomena (shadow detachment), not agency—no meaningful tightening of options. "Luminous torment eases" presents unearned resolution without visible price paid. Band guardrail for 8.0+ fails: no foreclosed path or trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: origami cranes as "folded fragments of sorrow turned into hope" avoids moralizing. Final image reweights premise via paradox ("ascend while descending") without stating moral. Near-miss with "luminous torment of memory" in climax—avoids full thematic echo but borders on sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines: "weaving light into filaments as if coaxing fireflies." Rhythmic control in "amber horizon refracting rainbows that sang to the wind." Overwriting in climax ("glows faintly, its paper veins lit by polished dream-light") slightly dulls immediacy. No head-hopping; POV stable throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Overwriting check fails: figurative language saturates climax ("origami cranes now swirl among stars... sorrow turned into hope") without pattern-teaching. Mixed metaphor: "glass envelope thin as a sigh" then "light ripple like water" violates physical logic. Template cadence in para 3 ("He works... He lifts... He watches...") triggers -0.6 penalty. Final third artifacts disallow 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-recording + origami grief avoids derivative tropes through specific glasswork mechanics. Emotional arc feels universal yet grounded in "roasted jasmine and sandalwood" sensory details. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes, but "grief dissolves" resolution lacks complexity—avoids safety middle yet feels slightly predictable.</comment>
