<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "scattered memory keeper" concept remains abstract label without embodied conflict in choices. Final renunciation of silence lacks micro-choice showing value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost ("weight of memories settle into purpose"), but cost proof is oblique. Accumulative lens holds though density increase lacks sufficient pressure tightening in final beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard functions as micro-setting that charges closure (vines intertwining sky), though copper/jasmine scent lacks causal constraint on choices. Sensory hierarchy masterfully reflects urgency during song sequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through atmospheric escalation (night softening to twilight), but dominant pressure lacks protagonist agency-driven trade-offs. "Knits communities" repetition substitutes for earned cost in communal gathering beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Thematic echo in final paragraph ("true alchemy was not in transmuting metal...") triggers -0.7 penalty. Conceptual repricing emerges implicitly earlier but moralizing undercuts earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("bark glimmering with scent of copper and jasmine"), though late arrival of spirits creates subtle POV leakage. Rhythmic control during song sequence exemplifies pressure modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Figurative density overwhelms closure beat: "ribbons of light seeped into soil" + "vines of silver bark rose" + "darkness pulling back" creates muddle. Template cadence in "Lira felt... Lira raised... Lira whispered" triggers -0.4 loop penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-keeping and alchemy avoids trope clichés, though "mirror world" proximity to common fantasy tropes limits distinction. Risk-taking in lyric escalation elevates within band despite minor derivative echoes.</comment>
