<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction under pressure is absent; "cool-headed" trait remains untested despite climax. Diagnostic label-speak ("vessel that transliterates emotions") undermines embodied emotion. No visible cost to character change despite closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise works under Accumulative lens, but conceptual cost ("promise of journeys yet untamed") lacks on-page legibility. Orientation clear early, but sky-tilting climax relies on coincidence rather than protagonist agency tightening options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sound wave garden functions as essential micro-setting: pathways as "invisible chords" constrain movement, reeds' chorus charges final image. Rail spike's physicality (rusted, vibrating) integrates with closure etching. No white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through density increase (constellations tangling, patterns breaking), but cost remains abstract. Dominant stake ("catch the echo") lacks visible price; "lingering pulse" feels unearned as payoff. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sonic particulars ("feral lullaby," "transliterates emotions into light"), but final paragraph moralizing ("not to trap it, but to set it free") replaces earned resonance. Avoids tidy binaries but lacks concrete emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sonic focus ("murmurs of water as notes"), but POV leaks omniscient phrasing ("the garden seemed to breathe"). Rhythmic control falters in climax ("He lifted... shouted..."). No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Severe overwriting: 15+ stacked metaphors in climax ("wounded bird," "silver tide," "fireflies in dusk"). Template cadence in pressure beats ("He felt... He knew... He lifted"). Filter-verb stack ("He sensed the echo was not...") dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fishing myth with sonic cosmology, but "goddess who sang world into being" echoes derivative creation tropes. Bold Accumulative structure heightens stakes, yet "feral lullaby" feels forced rather than earned.</comment>
