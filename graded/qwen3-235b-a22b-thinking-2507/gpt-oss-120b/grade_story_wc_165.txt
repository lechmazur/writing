<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation ("serenade monotony") lacks testing; interior contradiction absent as performer never faces meaningful failure. Epiphany feels unearned despite vivid embodied details like "hands trembling with purpose" during the ink drop.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure (Earned Stasis) works under Accumulative lens but cost ambiguity undermines it—the washed-away ink carries no felt loss, violating cost proof test. Strong orientation early, yet tidal resolution lacks irreversible consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tidal arcade actively constrains choices: water washes ink, dictates "next step," and charges final image with bishops clean. Neon ribbons evolve from decoration to "dancing shadows," making setting indispensable to closure’s meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes ("ordering randomness") remain abstract—no narrowing of options or visible price paid. Ink washes away harmlessly; performer immediately plans next sequence. Escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars but final whisper ("serenade monotony...") is thematic echo in closing lines, triggering -0.6 penalty. Conceptual repricing fails as "quiet revelation" lacks undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice distinct via "calculated wilderness" rhythm and perceptual bias ("gust remind him chaos could be a melody"). Minor psychic distance slip when child "giggled, claiming music made pieces wobble" without performer’s interpretation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose lush but scaffold in high-pressure beats: "calculated wilderness" repeats mechanically, and "twin guardians of chance" stacks abstraction. Final image suffers slight muddle from "faint imprint of a bishop’s crown" after physical wash.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chaos/order via tidal mechanics, but "calculated wilderness" trope lacks transformation. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure elevates it, yet emotional specificity falters without genuine struggle.</comment>
