<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction lacks embodied struggle; "quietly analytic" trait manifests as philosophical insight rather than flawed action. Final epiphany ("tension minus attachment") risks diagnostic label-speak without sufficient prior micro-choices showing contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise via snow globe's shattering into stars, reconfiguring "letting go" with felt cost ("his own story would soon dissolve"). Accumulative lens holds as sensory density builds toward crystallized final image without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting details vividly anchor atmosphere but fail to constrain choices; sunken library functions as static backdrop rather than active pressure. Micro-setting (snow globe) charges closure image yet doesn't alter Mort's tactics during exploration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Accumulative lens as wire-untangling shifts from task to metaphor, narrowing options toward surrender. Cost legible in Mort's dissolution ("story dissolve into deep"), but pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation—physics insights emerge passively rather than through active choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from snow globe/transmission motifs, avoiding moralizing. Final equation ("tension minus attachment") risks thematic echo but gains legitimacy through Charged Poise closure, reweighting "letting go" as transformative energy rather than surrender.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinct perceptual signature ("breath a silent bubble," "knots of his past") with rhythmic control. Minor register drift when physics metaphors override character-plausible lexicon ("luminous path of release" feels authorial rather than Mort's voice).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Severe overwriting in high-pressure beats: "frozen flakes that swirled like memory," "pulse of light to travel," and "melancholic tone reminded him of the world above" create figurative muddle. Template cadence in wire-untangling sequence dulls immediacy despite lyrical intent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ingenuity in synthesizing Earhart's legacy with physics metaphor feels fresh, but "sophisticated melancholy" risks generic abstraction. Bold structural choice (Accumulative lens) heightens stakes, though closure's reliance on scientific equation slightly undermines emotional specificity.</comment>
