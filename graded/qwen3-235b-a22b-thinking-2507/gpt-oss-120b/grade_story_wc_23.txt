<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "raw solace" borders on label-speak despite strong motivation. Final choice earned but micro-choices under pressure remain underdeveloped, weakening emotional layering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: ships' arrival crystallizes the reverse migration's success with conceptual cost (absorbed sorrow in censer patina). Accumulative lens holds through moon-phase cadence shifts without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Censer foot functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (moon-phase operation) and charges the final image (hollow coordinates). Patina's deepening directly alters tactics, satisfying 9+ gate for environment-as-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's engine construction narrows options toward reverse migration. Cost legible in censer's sorrow-absorbing patina, but hydraulic failure setup lacks sustained pressure evolution beyond initial atmosphere.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image of ships mirroring constellations offers non-literal answer to "geography of loss" without moralizing. Theme emerges through censer's evolving role, avoiding abstraction while embracing ambiguity in grief's necessity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("eyes sewn from half-remembered maps") and rhythmic control under pressure shine, though "raw solace" repetition slightly fractures voice consistency in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>No scaffold loops or figurative muddle; sentences like "lanterns flickering like the censer foot’s patina" achieve high density. Minor cliché ("cracked hush") prevents 9-band but closure remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "reverse migration" trope through concrete mechanics (censer engine, moon phases). Emotional specificity in mapping loss avoids generic templates, with risk-taking elevating stakes without obscurity.</comment>
