<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Reactively visionary" functions as diagnostic label-speak without embodied contradiction; exile motivation lacks visceral cost despite poetic interiority. Archivist's choices show no friction between compiling fragments and "letting gaps breathe" until abstract resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when the valve releases the chord, crystallizing communal meaning with conceptual cost of embracing absence. But exile backstory exceeds reflection ceiling without concrete anchoring (e.g., no micro-choice altering present tactics), triggering -0.4 penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ivory harbor's rain-soaked piers and brass valve actively constrain choices (e.g., metal "soaking" stories, staggered intervals shaping gathering). Micro-setting charges final image with "harbor holding its breath," satisfying 9+ gate. Occupational archiving details lack plausibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (compiling fragments despite absences) tightens through density increase as fragments accumulate, but protagonist agency remains passive reception rather than active choice. "Courage to let gaps breathe" lacks visible on-page cost demonstration per band guardrails.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through valve's transformation from announcement tool to memory repository; final chord reweights "navigated absences" without moralizing. "Reactively visionary" skirts thematic echo but avoids final-paragraph sermonizing, allowing near-9+ resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("pier soaking last sighs of storm," gulls' soft sighs), with rhythm mirroring archivist's methodical process. But "reactively visionary" causes register drift into clinical abstraction during high-pressure gathering sequences.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Template cadence ("Days turned into weeks... each morning... each new sound") triggers -0.4; mixed metaphor ("brass chamber sang a complex melody") violates physical logic. Final-third artifacts disallow 9+ despite otherwise vivid texture and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archive tropes via "cracked coral maps" and valve's evolving function, but "ivory harbor" leans toward cliché. Bold Accumulative structure pays off, though exile backstory feels derivative rather than transformed through specific detail.</comment>
