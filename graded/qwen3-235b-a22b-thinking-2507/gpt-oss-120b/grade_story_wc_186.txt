<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Interiority relies on thematic labels ("stubborn motivation") rather than embodied contradiction; final choice lacks visible cost or earned renunciation despite "felt cost" requirement. No micro-choices reveal value hierarchy under pressure—rekindling succeeds without struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation succeeds early with "lone beacon tower" and "glass humming pavilion," but closure lacks legible cost. Charged Poise forms when the lantern "sputters, then steadies," yet no tangible price (physical/emotional) is dramatized for rekindling, violating cost-proof test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass pavilion functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: "glass walls... sing like thistle" directly constrains the beacon's relighting. Sensory details ("cracked stone floor," "wind's memory") are selective, purposeful, and filtered through the custodian’s hope-driven perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("prove coincidences have meaning") is signaled early, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening. The caravan’s arrival resolves the conflict coincidentally rather than through earned agency, violating "coincidence may complicate, not resolve" rule. No visible price paid for rekindling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "thistle-blown hope" evolves from metaphor to tangible resonance in the final image. Avoids moralizing, but "renewal is possible when old eyes learn new sight" edges toward thematic echo, slightly muddying earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "glass walls vibrate softly with the wind’s memory," with rhythmic control modulating under pressure. Minor register drift in "retrocognitively blessed" slightly jars the custodian’s voice, but elision (star-tracking rituals) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with near-zero loops, but "thin ribbon of light unfurls" risks purple prose in a high-pressure beat. Strategic telling compresses backstory efficiently, though "my motivation is simple yet stubborn" tells rather than shows, slightly dulling immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes through specific sensory alchemy (glass humming, thistle resonance). Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes coherently, but "shard of hush" concept borders on familiar hope-magic without sufficient grounding in lived detail.</comment>
