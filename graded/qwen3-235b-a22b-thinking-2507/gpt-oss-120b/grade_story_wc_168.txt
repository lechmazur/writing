<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("hard softness") manifests in micro-choices like placing the box on the stone altar, but hiker backstory leans tell-over-show in the reflective block, slightly diluting earned motivation for the enlightenment quest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with the box's transformation and "felt cost" in Maren's "fire-scarred skin," but escalation lacks meaningful pressure tightening—the stakes remain abstract until the town square resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The ash valley and porcelain box constrain choices (e.g., setting the box on the stone altar) and charge the final image, yet the celestial bodies' "slow dance" feels decorative rather than pressuring decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating pain) is signaled early, but pressure never escalates beyond internal reflection; the town square resolution arrives without prior tactical shifts or earned cost demonstration in the ridge scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through the porcelain box's evolution—"cracked porcelain turned whole... by collective understanding" avoids moralizing while reweighting the "bargained innocence" premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in firefighter-specific details ("smoldering ash," "stitching wounds with silence"), but "bargained innocence" phrasing risks thematic echo, slightly muddying voice under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops and high density ("pine needles like distant applause"), yet "stars twirling in patient arcs that seemed to echo the beats of her own heart" edges into overwriting, dulling momentum in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "bargained innocence" via the porcelain box avoids firefighter clichés, but the pain-to-hope arc lacks a non-obvious moral calculus to reach higher bands.</comment>
