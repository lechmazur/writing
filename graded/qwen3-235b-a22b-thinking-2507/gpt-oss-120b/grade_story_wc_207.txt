<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through Mara's "sensibly eccentric" quest—her psychometry method and surrender to dissolution feel earned. Only missing a visible flaw complicating her choice earlier; "weight of every rain-kissed stone" embodies emotion without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Mara's realization that explanations fail is a "state of quiet surrender" carries conceptual cost ("explanations dissolved"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via sensory density escalation to the water staircase.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lagoon functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (stepping onto liquid glass) and charges the final image (compass pointing to rain). "Mineral musk" and "bioluminescent algae" filter through Mara's petrichor-collecting bias with purposeful specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mara's agency: her psychometry readings deepen the dominant stake (seeking meaning vs. embracing void). Cost is unmistakable—"explanations dissolved" and the compass's shift to pointing toward rain reweights her entire quest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the compass's needle steadying in the vortex reweights "hinged awakenings" as surrender, not location. Avoids moralizing; final image ("compass pointing toward rain clouds") resonates without stating the insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice modulates perfectly under pressure—lyric density ("slow, breathing sigh") tightens as the lagoon vibrates. Perceptual signature (scent-focused, tactile) remains consistent; no head-hopping despite mystical elements.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "water trembling in the dark" exemplifies triple-duty prose. Final line ("ready to delve deeper") recharges "delve" with new meaning. Only hairline slip: "psychometry read those fragments" slightly abstract but redeemed by "sigh of tectonic plates."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: petrichor obsession transforms mystical quest tropes through scent-based specificity. Transformation test fails if swapped (e.g., "birdsong collector" would collapse the emotional arc). Risk-taking (quiet closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
