<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels ("clear complexity," "noctilucent reckonings") without embodied contradiction; final choice lacks earned causality despite poetic resonance. Diagnostic label-speak in peak beats ("gratitude to the sunrise") triggers deduction without sufficient physical cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stakes but cost remains conceptual ("ledger of deeds forgotten") without legible on-page price. Accumulative lens holds, yet pressure lacks deepening driven by agency—the ritual's repetition feels predetermined, not earned through active choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prism atrium and stone constrain the ritual’s mechanics, charging the final image (stone as talisman). However, Pearl Bay’s setting functions as postcard backdrop; micro-setting fails to alter tactics beyond observation, missing 9+ gate for environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes (finding value in mundane) remain abstract without visceral escalation; pressure stagnates as passive observation. "Before everything shifts" implies time pressure but lacks live-clock consequences, failing to narrow options or generate trade-offs under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ripples/stone motif, avoiding direct moralizing, but final line ("value lives in every ripple") borders on thematic echo. Resonant reconfiguration succeeds via concrete particulars, though conceptual cost lacks emotional specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("noctilucent veil," "prismatic shards") modulates rhythm under pressure. Minor deduction: "noctilucent reckonings" drifts into academic diction, slightly violating harbor glazier’s plausible lexicon during peak reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but "clear complexity" and "noctilucent reckonings" verge on stock metaphor strings in high-pressure beats. No closure-dulling artifacts, though repetitive abstract phrasing limits propulsion near climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of harbor ritual and light physics, yet "stone-tossing for meaning" trope remains recognizable. Specificity (prism atrium’s refractions) elevates, but risk-taking doesn’t transform stakes enough for 8.5+ band.</comment>
