<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority leans poetic over embodied; "hopeful melancholy" label recurs without sufficient physical manifestation of contradictory impulses beyond stone interactions. Micro-choices during celestial alignment reveal hierarchy of values but lack visceral struggle in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: the glowing stone dent proves altered reality while exile's sorrow becomes a "compass." Orientation anchors by word 15; Accumulative lens holds through magnetic pulse cadence shifts that reweight the covenant's fracture into renewal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Basalt stone constrains choices and charges the final image—its dent transitions from anxiety scar to "quiet beacon," directly shaping the rook placement. Twilight's magnetic nexus pressures every action, with sensory details (crimson sky pulses, stone's hum) woven into tactical decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the tutor's agency: correlating sky patterns forces the bishop/rook placements that narrow options toward covenant rebirth. Cost is legible in "sorrow can be a compass" and the stone's dent glowing—a conceptual price paid through exile's endurance under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing by embedding theme in action: the final rook placement answers "beauty in difficulty" through chess-cosmic synthesis, not abstraction. But "sorrow can be a compass" edges toward thematic echo, slightly undermining the earned resonance of the glowing stone dent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines via chess-inflected noticing ("eclipsed covenant lingered," "pawn’s sacrifice echoed"); rhythm modulates from contemplative to urgent during celestial alignment. Zero head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure’s crystallized image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "whispered to the stone... stone responded" (adjacent paraphrase loop) triggers -0.2. Otherwise flawless propulsion: "magnetic currents waned, but the stone’s dent glowed" compresses consequence without redundancy. Figurative language serves momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms chess tropes through cosmic stakes—the pawn’s advance lesson reframed as covenant rebirth feels inevitable. Specificity anchors universals ("rust-colored dunes," basalt dent), but "hopeful melancholy" risks middle-ground hedging despite lyrical execution.</comment>
