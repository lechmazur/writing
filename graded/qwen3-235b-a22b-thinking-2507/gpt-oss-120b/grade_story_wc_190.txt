<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear but lacks interior contradiction; serene competence shows no struggle against her own agitation. "Believed the vial could catalyze calm" triggers diagnostic label penalty. Micro-choices (whispering counter-tones) exist but aren't pressured enough to reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: the empty vial and passengers carrying "vaulting hush" show visible cost of silencing the world. Orientation is perfect within 120 words. Accumulative lens holds consistently through density buildup to silver cascade.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prism terrace functions as micro-setting that charges the final image ("ship of glass over thought") and constrains choice via singing stones requiring noise monitoring. Storm glass vial qualifies as tool setting. Misses 9+ by not having environment directly alter a mid-scene tactic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stake (silence as comfort) signaled early with one meaningful deepening (amber to silver cascade). Pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens but lacks protagonist agency—Lira observes/reacts rather than makes contested choices. Cost (empty vial) is visible but not tied to her action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: vial's color shifts, whispered counter-tones teaching silence. Final whisper "Listen, and let quiet become your guide" avoids moralizing by being dramatized. Landing at the quiet garden offers resonant non-literal answer to "in transit" through passengers carrying hush.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("translucent stones that sang with wind, each note a reminder") with rhythmic control under pressure. "Fluidly logical" phrase risks register drift but saved by context. Zero head-hopping; sensory selection reflects Lira's priorities ("monitored noise levels with a small brass ear").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion but "in the quiet that follows a train whistle’s echo" repeats verbatim—minor scaffold loop preventing 9+. Final paragraph ("Dreams lingered") achieves perfect textural specificity. No figurative muddle; "prism facets catching light like fractured lullabies" integrates metaphor with action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "silence as comfort" trope through storm glass chemistry and prism physics. Emotional truth in making silence active ("whispered counter-tone to soften it"). Avoids sentimentality via concrete mechanics. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off with indigo sky humming faintly.</comment>
