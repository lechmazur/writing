<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "letting go" epiphany feels told ("reminding me why I sought...") not earned through struggle. No second character tests relationships, weakening "familiar strangers" as crucible. Diagnostic phrasing triggers Q1 penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Closure fails cost proof test: storm resolution lacks visible price ("farm survived untouched"). Drive lens ambiguity (hybrid but unresolved) and coincidence-driven solution violate "coincidence may complicate but not resolve." No legible cost at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Bioluminescent setting vividly anchors atmosphere ("caps pulsed like soft lanterns"), but micro-setting only pressures choices late (storm sequence). Misses 9+ gate: environment constrains tactics only in final third, too late to charge closure image holistically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("revolutionize protection") until storm, which feels coincidental not earned. No visible price paid—farm survives "untouched," violating band guardrail requiring "visible or felt price." Pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation under any lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme derailed by thematic echo: "letting go - was not surrender but..." states thesis outright. Final image ("revolution can begin with a single press") avoids moralizing but lacks conceptual repricing; cost remains abstract, failing Q5's resonance test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sense subtle warps in the field") shines, but "quiet wildfire" and "spatially gifted" feel jargon-y. Rhythmic control strong until storm sequence, where template cadence ("The permeable barriers flexed...") dulls immediacy under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Overwriting in peak beats: "quiet surge, like embers sparking under ash" strains metaphor. Syntactic monotony in storm resolution ("The permeable barriers flexed...") and thematic echo in final paragraph trigger artifact deductions. Momentum loss from scaffold loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bioluminescence and laser tech elevates premise, but "familiar strangers" and "quiet wildfire" feel derivative. Emotional specificity lacks in protagonist's arc; risk-taking (permeable barriers as metaphor) undermined by tell-don't-show execution.</comment>
