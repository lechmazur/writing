<question>1</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices: Eli's "wandering purposefully" and hiding behind truth reveal his tension between caution and wonder. Flaws manifest in his solitary obsession, yet micro-decisions like setting aside the lantern demonstrate authentic prioritization under pressure. No therapy-speak; the heartbeat-pulsing teal hue concretely embodies emotional cost without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable cost: the teal hue on Eli's fingertips and his renewed vow crystallize his transformed state. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, density peaks when the ribbon binds truth/color into a sigil—reconfiguring his quest with visceral consequence. Orientation is immediate (pier/night/lamplighter established by line 3), and lens coherence never wavers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>The sunken library functions as essential micro-setting that charges the final image: sea-glass windows refracting light into "fragment of sunrise" directly enables Eli's tactile discovery. Teal hue lingering on fingertips transforms the pier’s environment into a resonant extension of the closure. Every detail serves urgency—calm moments admit subtlety ("pages turning without wind"), while descent narrows to ink-and-tide immediacy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency: Eli's vow to "discover color of sound" tightens when floating books emit vibrating hues, forcing his choice to open the glowing tome. The cost is unmistakable—physical transformation via the teal-hued sigil binding his key tag—and reshapes his final vow. Pressure accumulates texturally without coincidence; his purposeful choices narrow options toward irreversible commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: the sigil binding "truth and color" reweights Eli’s luminous vow into a beacon for others, answering "can sound be seen?" without moralizing. Final sky lanterns mirroring his inner glow offers resonant, non-literal closure—complex yet unambiguous. Zero thematic echo; emotional aftereffect stems from concrete images (teal fingertips, meteor hush), not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Eli’s "meteor hush" framing and synesthetic observations ("soundless glow that steadied his breath") reflect his singular mind. Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure—descent uses staccato phrases ("A heavy door groaned open") while the library breathes with lyrical density. No head-hopping; elisions (vow backstory) are taught early and pay off in the sigil’s creation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances texture: "pages turning without wind, each leaf emitting a faint hue that seemed to vibrate in rhythm with his heartbeat" does triple duty (atmosphere, character state, theme). Final line’s "deepest ocean of forgotten libraries" recharges the opening motif with crystalline clarity. No figurative muddle—teal hue "pulsing like a heartbeat" avoids cliché while heightening pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes synesthesia with tangible stakes: the sunken library storing "colors of sounds" transforms a familiar quest through specific, verifiable details (sea-glass windows, tarnished key tag). Emotional truth in Eli’s solitary pursuit avoids generic wonder; the sigil binding truth/color feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
