<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prince's motivation is clear but interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "flaw mirrored his own" uses diagnostic label-speak (-0.5). Change feels earned yet passive—egg hatching resolves conflict without genuine struggle, missing visceral cost escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong accumulative lens builds pressure through sensory density, but closure lacks cost proof: phoenix instantly fixes systemic flaws with no sacrifice. "Flawed genesis" vanishes without struggle, violating "coincidence may complicate but not resolve" rule—fatal for closure validity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Suspended palace actively constrains choices (water stream for cradle assembly, stalactite anchoring), charging the final swaying image. Gears and egg iridescence reweight closure—environment shapes tactics without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake tightens through assembly process, but resolution violates accumulative lens: egg hatching requires zero cost (no failed attempts, resource loss). "Bitterly sweet" promise isn't paid in visceral tradeoffs—coincidence solves the central conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (salvaged gears, displaced ecosystems), but final line states thesis: "beauty could be forged as surely as steel." Avoids moralizing yet over-promises redemption, flattening complexity with unrealistic systemic fix.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("heart beat for something softer") reflects prince's state, but filter verbs ("he sensed," "he knew") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Rhythmic control shifts from mechanical cadence to fluidity, though "quaking reverie" repetition becomes scaffold loop.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Severe figurative muddle in climax: "burst of feathered light erupted, scattering... igniting pistons with song of wind" obscures cause/effect. "Bitterly sweet" label appears 3x as empty repetition; final thematic statement triggers -0.8 artifact penalty in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Suspended garden of gears and feathers" transforms phoenix trope through mechanical specificity, but redemption arc follows predictable beats. Fresh synthesis lacks non-obvious moral calculus—no genuine tension between precision and fragility beyond surface imagery.</comment>
