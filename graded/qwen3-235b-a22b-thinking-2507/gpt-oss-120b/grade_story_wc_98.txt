<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("luminous doubt" as catalyst) and embodied emotion ("air tasted of citrus and rain") feel authentic, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses during the pivotal translation sequence where stress would fracture thought.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with "weight of storm/lightness of hope" crystallizing stakes; monsoon deadline creates visible cost. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds consistently through ridge's physical response to translations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ancient ridge functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (translations tied to its memory) and charges closure ("ridge stood radiant"); jade vines/orchids evolve causally from description to translation anchors under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Monsoon deadline tightens decisions effectively, but dream translation sequence reads as mechanical checklist ("became a map... became a rhythm") rather than organic escalation; cost is legible but deepening lacks visceral progression.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "petals a repository of forgotten chants" reweights cultural memory without moralizing; final image of "balance she vowed to keep" offers resonant non-literal answer to preservation dilemma.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Empirically whimsical" establishes distinct perceptual signature; rhythmic control shines in incantation ("Let the seed awaken...") but dream translations suffer uniform syntax ("X became Y") during high-pressure sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop in dream translations ("jade vine became... orchid's pulse became...") triggers -0.3 deduction; otherwise crystalline density ("leaves shimmering like silvered pages") with purposeful cadence shifts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "cultural memory" trope through specific mechanics (knowledge fruit as living archive, doubt as catalyst); risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off with ridge's physical response to translations.</comment>
