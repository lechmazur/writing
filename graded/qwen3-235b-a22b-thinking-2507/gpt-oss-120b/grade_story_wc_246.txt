<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses during pivotal editing moment; "confidently uncertain" is embodied but internal conflict remains abstract rather than simultaneous struggle in action. Micro-choices like pen manipulation reveal values but without layered irrationality under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Valid Earned Stasis closure with conceptual cost ("echo lingered" makes permanent uncertainty legible). Accumulative lens holds through density increase in "luminescent buds" sequence. Minor deduction for no mid-scene setback testing commitment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pen (micro-setting) charges final image as "beacon," but gravitational anomaly remains atmospheric rather than constraining choices. Sensory details vivid yet fail the 9+ gate—environment doesn't shape tactics, only mood. "Exotic nib" specificity elevates tool integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stake tightening occurs when pen "drinks ambient gravity," narrowing options through protagonist agency. Conceptual cost (permanent uncertainty) is legible but doesn't visibly charge the final image per 8.8+ band guardrail. One meaningful deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "garden pruning itself" metaphor without moralizing. Final image ("beacon for all who dare to unbend reality") reweights prior chaos with earned resonance. Loses points for near-abstraction in "willingness to edit history without erasing identity."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tangled ribbons of light") and rhythmic control under pressure. Register drift in "threshed meaning from experience" (academic diction) violates POV lexicon. No head-hopping; elision taught early via anomaly's "tides."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "pen... inhale the altered history" (action/image/theme in one stroke). Minor purple prose in "luminescent buds that glowed with corrected data" costs 0.2. Final line propulsion flawless with "quiet rebellion against chaos."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scientific/gardening metaphors ("orchard of data," "pruning after storm") transforms tropes. Emotional specificity in "strange comfort" avoids generic templates. Derivative guardrail avoided, but "gravitational anomaly" lacks transformative specificity for 9.0+.</comment>
