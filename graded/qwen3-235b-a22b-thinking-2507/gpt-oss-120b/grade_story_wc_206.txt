<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses; Alder's flawless competence undercuts struggle. Micro-choices (aligning teeth, humming) exist but lack pressured value hierarchy. Interiority stays abstract despite vivid action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: covenant repaired but perpetually fragile, with conceptual cost ("any future dishonesty would cause it to wilt") made undeniable in the final image. Accumulative lens holds through rhythmic density escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rust functions as micro-setting that charges the final image ("luminous lattice" binding covenant), constraining Alder's mending method. Sensory details stay POV-filtered (e.g., "air humming with low brass tones" reflecting his expertise).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Time pressure ("midnight had already begun to steal...") meaningfully tightens tactics, narrowing options to the final gear alignment. Conceptual cost (covenant's truth-dependence) is legible in the resolution beat without retroactive fixes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through rust's transformation from "living curse" to "garden of iron vines," but final moralizing ("as long as honest hands tended... light would never again be stolen") triggers -0.6 penalty for thematic echo in closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("tinkersong wonder," gear-focused metaphors), but uniform stress-response cadence ("He circled... humming... for he knew...") flattens peak-beat rhythm during midnight pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Template cadence in high-pressure beat ("He circled... humming... for he knew...") triggers -0.4 penalty. Stock phrases ("garden of iron vines," "luminescence rose") clutter the midnight escalation, dulling immediacy despite lyrical strengths.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rust-as-covenant avoids trope clichés, with specificity ("philosopher's stone chip glowed amber") grounding the magic. Risks pay off through earned coherence, though emotional complexity stays surface-level.</comment>
