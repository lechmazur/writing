<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels like "affectionate detachment" without embodied contradiction; the servant's pivotal emotional shift lacks concrete physicality ("ache melt" feels diagnostic, not visceral), violating core requirement for contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with visible cost ("journey recorded not in triumphs but in soft affectionate detachment"), but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural vs. Situational) past midpoint triggers -0.3 penalty despite functional closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Icebound spire functions as micro-setting through light-refraction mechanics that constrain choices (e.g., scattered light guiding descent), though environmental specificity rarely tightens tactics beyond atmospheric resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes ("joy beneath anguish") are clear early but lack meaningful escalation; discovery feels effortless with no active opposition or tactical cost during quest, failing the 8.8+ requirement for visible price charging the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete actions (goggles unlocking diary), but final line ("quiet resilience of those who ascend") edges toward thematic echo, diluting earned resonance despite avoiding direct moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with distinct perceptual signature (light/ice focus), but "affectionate detachment" repeats as conceptual crutch without modulation under stress, flattening emotional texture during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Overwriting dominates peak beats: "prismatic shards that danced" and "thrums with a low, melodic hum" stack metaphors without pattern-teaching; template cadence ("He lifted... He read... He returned") triggers -0.6 penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Synthesizes tropes (lone seeker, magical object) with fresh specificity (copper-rimmed goggles decoding via light), but "joy in crystal jars" feels derivative; no bold risk-taking elevates beyond competent execution.</comment>
