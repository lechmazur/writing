<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Selene's "uncommonly serene" trait manifests concretely in her dish arrangement under pressure and argument memory, with embodied contradiction (calm motions vs snowfall-dense hush). Final renunciation of control ("strings of conscience unspooling") earns cost through the dying ember's ash settlement, though "ethical storytelling" labels slightly undermine interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "meteor hush that followed her steps" crystallizes the ethical storytelling shift with conceptual cost (ember as memory, not tool). Orientation anchors at 38 words; Accumulative lens holds via sensory density buildup to the string-reversal revelation, where pressure narrows options through the waning fire.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Radar dome's inverted dishes actively constrain choices—they become reflective tools for Selene's experiment, not backdrop. The campfire stick's ember directly charges closure as "lantern of ethical wonder," with pine scent and concrete cracks evolving causally to enable the pivotal shadow-play revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stake (ethical storytelling method) tightens when the waning ember forces Selene's agency—"lifted the stick, and the fire's glow brightened"—changing knowledge about puppet strings. Cost is visible in "let the fire die" (sacrificing physical tool) and ash settlement, driving the Accumulative escalation toward conceptual reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image ("strings of conscience unspooling like ribbons of starlight") offers non-literal answer to central question without moralizing. Theme emerges through "half-lit" motif reweighted from "fleeting flashes" to "chorus of truth," avoiding thematic echo despite "ethical storytelling" mentions early on.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "ember-kissed tip flickering like a quiet comet" and "hush as dense as fresh snowfall" reflect her calligrapher's precision. Minor flaw: "uncommonly serene" appears twice as label, but compression ("meteor hush") is taught early and paid off in closure's atmospheric modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "ribbons of starlight" avoids cliché by connecting to earlier comet simile. Deduction for paraphrase loop—adjacent beats repeat "uncommonly serene" without added pressure—dulling immediacy slightly in high-pressure revelation moment, but closure image remains crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms puppet trope through specific mechanics (dishes as mirrors, ember-light revelation). "Half-lit epiphanies" feels fresh, not derivative; +0.3 risk distinction for lyrical density payoff in Charged Poise closure. Avoids safety middle with "reverse exploitation" moral calculus.</comment>
