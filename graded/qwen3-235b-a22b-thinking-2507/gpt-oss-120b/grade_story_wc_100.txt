<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract ("carrier of silence") with therapy-speak labels; embodied contradiction is underdeveloped despite strong motivation. Final endurance earns cost through dissolution into light, but micro-choices lack specific trade-offs under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost (Marlow's dissolution into the light), crystallizing rest as permanent address. Accumulative lens holds, though reflection block slightly dilutes present-frame pressure near midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Submerged library actively constrains choices (water pressure fights light, floating pedestal), with the broken lens charging the final image. "Chased stillness" motif delayed but reweights closure powerfully; micro-setting excellence elevates beyond vivid description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stake (rest for the dead) tightens through light pulses that transform spirits' state, but escalation relies more on environmental accumulation than Marlow's agency. Cost is visible (his vanishing) yet one concrete trade-off during reassembly would deepen tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from lens reassembly into "fractured hope," avoiding moralizing. Final image ("never be truly forgotten") resonates through particulars, though "revitalize rest" risks thematic echo without sufficient prior struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("boots echoing as footsteps on a grave") and rhythmic control under pressure; lyrical compression taught early. Zero register drift even during high-stakes reassembly, with marine lexicon reinforcing undertaker's worldview.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with varied sentence rhythms, but "chased stillness" repeats identically at 60% and 80% marks. Minor paraphrase loop ("impossible spaces") prevents 9.0 despite exceptional density in light-pulse sequences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "lighthouse for souls" trope through tactile specificity (phosphorescent ink, marble tablets). Emotional truth in Marlow's quiet dissolution avoids sentimentality, though undertaker archetype isn't fully subverted beyond occupational lens.</comment>
