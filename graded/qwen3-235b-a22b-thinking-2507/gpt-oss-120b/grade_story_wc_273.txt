<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Label-heavy emotions ("serene anger," "calm fury") lack embodied contradiction; albino trait unused for sensory specificity. No micro-choices under pressure—Kael observes passively without internal conflict. Diagnostic label-speak in peak beats triggers -0.5 penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost ("histories erased like ink"), but lens ambiguity persists past midpoint—Accumulative/Textural only crystallizes late during ink patterns. Fails lens clarity check (-0.4), though cost proof ("paid the price of oblivion") is concrete.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Wind-carved stones and disappearing ink actively constrain choices: ink vanishing enables the "conduit" revelation, while drone flight depends on wind currents. Final image ("patterns etched in sand") charges closure by making setting a legacy of crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen as ink patterns rise, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—Kael triggers events yet pressure stems from ink's behavior, not his choices. No visible price paid; conceptual cost ("oblivion") remains abstract without on-page forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ink’s transformation: "world’s collective pause" reweights time as fragile thread without moralizing. Final spiral’s "whisper of scent" offers resonant answer—time flows when danger recedes—avoiding thematic echo in closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct tracker voice ("wind-carved alcoves," "cracked ground") with rhythmic control during high-pressure beats. Minor register drift in "conduit" and "calm fury" label slightly undermines embodied urgency near climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong density in desert descriptions, but adjacent synonym loops ("ephemeral patterns... ghostly tide") and overwriting ("serene anger melt into purpose, a fire") in final beat. Artifacts don’t touch closure but dull momentum (-0.3).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: disappearing ink as temporal map transforms crisis tropes. Wind-carved setting actively shapes ritual, but albino tracker leans on mystical-outsider archetype without sufficient grounding. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
