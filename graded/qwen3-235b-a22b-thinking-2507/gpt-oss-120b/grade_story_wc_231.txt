<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied in micro-choices (aligning flower with tide lull), but "borrowed memories" concept leans abstract without sufficient physical friction; emotional progression lacks contradictory impulses at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (isolation transformed into witness), Accumulative lens held through tide-rhythm pattern; one decisive deepening (decoding pauses) reweights stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Opal dock constrains choice (aligning flower to tide lull) and charges final image; "softly persistent" motif shifts from description to embodied rhythm in closure beat, avoiding static symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via nautical twilight deadline, but pressure lacks tangible cost escalation; "decode gesture" motivation remains abstract without concrete obstacle beyond fading light.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through Edelweiss/tide interplay ("imprint remained" reweights memory); avoids moralizing, though "borrowed memories" risks abstraction without sufficient physical stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("opal surface reflected isolation") with rhythmic control; syntactic variation mirrors tide cadence under pressure, no head-hopping in single-POV frame.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density, but "invisible ink" metaphor slightly muddles closure beat; strategic lyricism serves Accumulative lens without obscuring cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse trope via tide-rhythm decoding; emotional specificity avoids sentimentality, though Edelweiss risks symbolic convenience without deeper constraint.</comment>
