<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; dissolution choice feels earned yet emotional progression too smooth without visceral struggle during climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with conceptual cost (fragment dissolving into shared memory), but felt cost remains oblique; accumulative lens holds though causal triggers for pattern convergence lack specificity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Alchemist’s market constrains choices (paintings as maps) and charges final image; lighthouse fragment as micro-setting drives tactics and closure, meeting 9+ gate for environment shaping outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes (honoring overlooked histories) tighten via pattern alignment, but escalation lacks visceral pressure; cost is conceptual (dissolution) yet insufficiently felt during the pivotal unfastening moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through lighthouse-as-metaphor ("beacon for those who could not read the tide"), though final whisper risks bordering on moralizing without full dramatic integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("tracing curve of gull’s wing to lantern’s flame"); rhythmic control under pressure elevates lyric mode, with patterned elision taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor overwriting ("breath for the living") and repetitive "elusively tangible" usage; high density maintained but slight figurative muddle in high-pressure alignment beat reduces propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "between-worlds translator" trope through alchemist-market specificity; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes, though "overlooked histories" theme leans familiar without deeper moral complexity.</comment>
