<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Embodied emotion shines (pine needle skin tingle), but "quietly talented gait" feels like a label without demonstrated tradeoffs; final renunciation earned through somatic micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost ("faint ridge of paper" as love's scar), but the accumulative lens lacks a persistent constraint shaping tactics; the cost proof is palpable yet narrowly contained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The arboretum functions as micro-setting—pine needle triggers somatic safety, storm-scarred sapling mirrors her resilience—constraining choice and charging the final beacon-planting image with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize around anchoring hope in tragedy, but escalation relies on internal density shifts rather than protagonist-driven narrowing; the cost ("love survived" via photo ridge) is felt but not leveraged to alter tactics meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "cracked soil of tragedy" and resilient pines, avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights loss/hope without stating a moral, offering earned resonance through the planted beacon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("edges frayed like coastline"), but "quietly talented" introduces generic voice drift; rhythmic control wavers in mid-stress description despite strong lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with clear propulsion ("wind tugged a pine needle across her cheek" embodies tension), though "pearl of stillness" risks metaphorical muddle if over-abstracted.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Transforms trauma tropes via somatic markers ("pearl of stillness"), but "drone strike wedding survivor" premise lacks fresh inflection; emotional specificity in the sapling whisper elevates it beyond generic resilience narratives.</comment>
