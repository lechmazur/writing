<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in weighing dream vs empire is embodied via "mulberry ache" flavoring decisions, but telepathic bond with vines lacks prior causality and feels unearned, weakening final choice motivation despite strong micro-choices like aligning violin with coffee rings.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (humbled empire sharing resources), but the envoy's sudden appearance and sword-lowering resolution relies on coincidence rather than protagonist agency, failing cost proof test for visible legible sacrifice at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Velvet observatory's micro-setting constrains choices decisively: vines become city foundations, coffee stains guide decisions, and brass desk enables violin alignment—environment actively charges the final image of autonomous skyward garden.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through coffee stain readings narrowing options under Accumulative lens, but the "weeks" timeframe remains abstract rather than a live clock altering tactics, missing band guardrail requirement for visible price charging the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through final image of shared iron resources and skyward garden, avoiding moralizing, but "a dream could outweigh an empire" borders on thematic echo, nearly triggering penalty for stated moral in closing reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines via "mulberry ache" and coffee-ring lattices, with rhythmic compression under pressure; minor register drift when violin "mapped perforated destiny" slightly clashes with researcher POV lexicon in high-stakes beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-zero loops with high density, but paraphrase redundancy in "propagate hope by reading... interpreting curling shadows" dulls immediacy; no figurative muddle in closure beat preserves momentum despite minor scaffold in mid-scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of coffee-stain oracles and vine-propagated dissent transforms "dream vs empire" trope, though provenance researcher role remains underutilized as mere verification tool rather than driving conflict with expertise.</comment>
