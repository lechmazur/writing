<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown via "vigilant" duty versus reverence for memory; embodied emotion in "heart beat with calm certainty." But "precisely humane" trait remains label without sufficient action demonstration under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as townspeople's "mirrored hush" crystallizes reconfigured meaning with felt cost ("weight of truth lift"). Accumulative lens holds through photographic revelations, though photograph discovery edges toward convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ridgeway embankment actively constrains movement while water reflections charge closure ("reservoir glimmered like ancient eye"). Sapphire label functions as micro-setting object altering tactics when placed beside chime.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expunging myth) tightens through photographic revelations, with cost unmistakable in "dam inside them cracked open." Agency slightly undermined by photographs feeling discovered rather than earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars: lantern glow as "promise," final reservoir as "ancient eye" offers resonant answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo though "shared narrative" phrasing risks abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in water/light observations ("silver ribbon," "deep blue swirl echoing water’s memory"). Minor register drift in "precisely humane" but rhythmic control holds through wind chime's "faint tinkle."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density ("lantern glow reflected like a promise" does triple duty) but paraphrase loop in "hush" repetitions ("hush that fell," "mirrored hush") dulls closure beat. No figurative muddle in peak moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of flood myth through sensory-specific details (sapphire label trade, wind chime crystals). Transforms trope via "quiet construction of truth" angle without gimmickry, though reservoir premise has real-world echoes.</comment>
