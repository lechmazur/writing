<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Interiority poetic but lacks contradictory impulses; "chronologically homesick" functions as diagnostic label without embodied cost within 2-3 lines, triggering -0.5 penalty. Closure (Earned Stasis) feels unmotivated by prior struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost reweighting longing as compass, but cost isn't legible on-page per "cost proof test"—"no longer burden" is stated not shown. Accumulative lens holds though pressure lacks meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting (glass spire/frozen lake) charges final image as vibrating membrane, but fails 9+ gate by not constraining choices—Lian's actions aren't shaped by physical environment. Sensory details vivid yet occasionally generic ("upended hush").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hearing symphonies) signaled early but pressure doesn't escalate through protagonist agency; lake's transformation feels coincidental not earned. Band guardrail violated—no visible price charging final image despite conceptual shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "mirrored horizon" reweighted at closure (triumph reflection), avoiding moralizing. Final fortune resonates non-literally but "chronologically homesick" label slightly undermines subtext. Strong organic emergence from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("phosphorescent memory," "frost-etched glass") and rhythmic control under pressure. "Upended hush" repetition slightly mannered but pattern taught early and paid off in final "orchestra" image. No POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("wave travelled through glass, ice, lake" does triple duty). "Upended hush" repetition triggers -0.2 paraphrase loop penalty. Final beat crystalline: "shimmering with color, each ripple a note" avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: fortune cookie writer as symphony conductor using nautilus as memory compass transforms tropes through sensory logic (ice as sound membrane). Emotional truth in "homesick as compass" reconfiguration justifies risk-taking without gimmickry.</comment>
