<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lacks concrete interiority and contradictory impulses; emotional shifts like "surge of longing" feel summarized rather than embodied through micro-choices under pressure. No visible cost to the guard’s change from dreamless to feeling warmth, rendering the endurance unearned despite poetic phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with the dune’s renewal, but the cost proof test fails—the guard’s persistent dreamlessness isn’t dramatized as a meaningful price paid. Accumulative lens holds, yet the felt cost remains abstract despite vivid imagery of ash-to-seed transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The chess clock constrains choice (frozen state reversed to birth dawn) and charges the final image; the dune’s micro-setting directly alters tactics by absorbing sparks. Sensory hierarchy excels—violet sand petals and fractured lullaby evolve causally with the guard’s actions, avoiding static symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes (renewing forests from ash) deepen through density increase as the dune shifts color and the clock ticks, but no tangible trade-off or visible price narrows options. Agency feels passive—the guard’s chants succeed without struggle, weakening escalation under the accumulative lens despite lyrical pressure buildup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the dune’s transformation (ashes to seed) and the lullaby’s evolution, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights renewal as "trees formed from pure light," but "proof that sparks had taken root" slightly overstates, diluting the earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in phrases like "metronome of sighs" and "sand learning to breathe," with rhythmic control intensifying under pressure. Elision of backstory is taught early via the clock’s lore, paying off in the archive’s blooming without POV leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fractured lullaby" repetition is pattern-taught and reweighted meaningfully. High density ("lattice of wave functions charming existence") risks muddle but remains legible within the established lexicon, with final lines charging closure through concrete action ("sparks fell like rain").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of eco-apocalypse and quantum lyricism avoids tropes—violet sand dunes and reverse-ticking clocks feel inevitable. Risk-taking heightens stakes (dreamless guard igniting renewal), though "wave functions" slightly echoes familiar sci-fi without full transformation.</comment>
