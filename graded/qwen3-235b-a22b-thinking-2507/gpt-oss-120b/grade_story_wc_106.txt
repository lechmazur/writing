<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; epiphany feels unearned without prior struggle. "Realized the thief’s true calling" uses diagnostic label-speak in peak beat without embodied cost, triggering penalty. Conductor serves as prop, not pressure source.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost: lantern ignition symbolizes surrender of thievery for guardianship. But cost remains abstract—no visible sacrifice like destroyed tools or exposure. Orientation clear by line 1; Accumulative lens holds through closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Emerald station evolves from setting to active constraint: jade door requires moonbeam unlocking, library shelves charge final image. Micro-setting (jar) drives tactics—flower codes alter access. "Velvet case" ornamental, but station’s light-reflective quality is indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Accumulative pressure: rose unlocks jar, lilies reconfigure purpose, map reveals chamber. But no opposition or cost—conductor aids her, no trade-off paid. "Heart raced, not for riches" hints at internal conflict but lacks dramatized friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "preserve fleeting brilliance" crystallizes via lantern ignition reweighting "illuminated moments" as collective heritage. Avoids moralizing; final image ("beacon inviting...") offers non-literal answer. "Destiny’s door" borders on thematic echo but not in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Lira notices light textures ("liquid silver ribbons," "luminous disbelief"). Rhythm modulates from lyrical ("whispers of forgotten travelers") to sparse during action. Minor register drift in "destiny’s symphony" but consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Adjacent paraphrase loops: "painting the sky in whispers" followed by "moved like liquid dusk" restates atmosphere. Template cadence in high-pressure beats ("Lira gently pressed... Lira felt... Lira arranged"). Overwritten metaphors ("moonbeams that danced like liquid silver ribbons. Each photon seemed to remember...") blur clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms "thief" trope through specific mechanics: flower-code decryption and moonbeam physics. Emerald station’s light-reflective quality is irreplaceable—swap generic "train station" and library revelation fails. "Crystal scrolls recording every sunrise" synthesizes freshness with emotional truth.</comment>
