<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in scientific humility ("tending to garden ghosts") avoids stock epiphanies; contradictory impulses (cosmic scale vs. micro-observation) drive the final whisper. Single-character constraint limits relationship dynamics slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "decay never truly ends, it only cycles" crystallizes the Accumulative lens. Orientation clear by word 40; cost legible in the greenhouse's "scarred yet hopeful" transformation foreclosing grandiosity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse constrains choices (aligning vial with light patterns) and charges closure; "cool sigh" of temperature dip embodies decay-as-breath. Dust's "iridescent particles arranging along cracks" transforms setting from tomb to active participant in the premise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake (microscopic patterns preprocessing reality) tightens via Mara's agency: humidity observations prove dust alters environment. Cost is conceptual—abandoning supernova-scale drama for "garden ghosts"—felt in the final pulse of change beneath her boots.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (dust binding nutrients), not abstraction. Final line—"smallest speck can steer fate"—resonates without moralizing, reweighting "stripped drama" through the greenhouse's quiet revival as a "participant in a larger narrative."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: scientific precision ("humidity gradients") merges with lyrical restraint ("dust settled like snowfall"). Rhythm modulates under pressure—short clauses during vial collection, flowing sentences in reflection—without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffolding; "fractured beams highlighting slow decay" compresses setting/theme. Minor abstraction in "kindled humility" (word 150) is redeemed by embodied context. Final line’s cadence ("scarred yet hopeful, mirrored her own journey") avoids cliché.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astrophysics and decay avoids tropes; "butterfly dust as catalyst" transforms a common motif through iridescent specificity. Risk-taking (quiet causality over drama) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, passing the transformation test.</comment>
