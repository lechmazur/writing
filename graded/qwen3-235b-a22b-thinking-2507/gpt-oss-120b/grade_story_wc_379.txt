<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion in locket's "cool memory," but Mara's flawlessness lacks contradictory impulses; "motivation steadied her hands" triggers diagnostic label-speak penalty undercutting earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with sandstorm calm reconfiguration, but cost remains conceptual/oblique; no exact on-page sentence makes cost legible per Q2's strict proof test, preventing 8.0+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vibrant courtyard details (wet stone, blossoms) anchor early, yet setting functions as passive backdrop; micro-setting of locket constrains choices but fails to charge final image per Q3's 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes (listening vs. city noise) signaled early, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening; Mara's calm persists effortlessly without visible price altering tactics, failing Q4's 8.8+ band requirement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Listening truly healed" in final paragraph commits Thematic Echo, overriding earned resonance; theme emerges organically through letters but moralizing caps score despite strong subtext in whispers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cracked mugs, whispered story") shines, yet "catalogued letters like artifacts of empathy" violates POV plausibility with academic diction during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Repetitive "sandstorm calm" (5x) and "led through following" create text loops; thematic echo in final paragraph triggers -1.1 artifact penalty, dulling closure's resonance despite lyrical strengths.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis in thrift-store curator framing neighborhood memory, but "calm before storm" metaphor feels derivative; emotional truth lifts tropes yet avoids bold risk-taking required for 8.5+.</comment>
