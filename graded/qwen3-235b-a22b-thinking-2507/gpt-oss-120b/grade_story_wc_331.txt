<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; Mara’s "sanely eccentric" trait enables success without struggle or tradeoffs. Final choice (tucking scarf) lacks earned cost despite "continual care" mention, feeling like maintenance rather than renunciation. Interiority vivid but avoids authentic conflict escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with conceptual cost ("not permanent; required continual care") legible in final image. Accumulative lens holds via density escalation (scarf vibrations → lattice dissolution → star projection), though pressure leans atmospheric over agency-driven. Orientation clear by line 20 anchors the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (scarf as tool) constrains choices during climax (adjusting frayed edges amplifies field) and charges final image ("fibers humming softly"). Library’s sensory details vivid but don’t actively shape tactics beyond providing ritual space; environment functions as atmospheric container rather than pressure point.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early ("reawaken analog memories"), escalation via density increase (patrons’ solitary reading → shared communion) reweights dominant stake under Accumulative lens. Cost ("continual care") is felt but not viscerally dramatized; Mara’s agency drives pressure yet feels secondary to the library’s autonomous mechanics during climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (walnut tree memory, star chronicle), avoiding abstraction. Final image reweights "place where stories truly lived" with conceptual cost (stewardship requires perpetual effort), offering non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic echo; resonance stems from scarf’s humming promise in closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("vellum and electronic sighs," "ozone and ink") with rhythmic control sustaining calm-to-intensified cadence. Psychic distance stays tightly focalized, though "observed solitude" appears as label without full embodiment in peak beats. Zero head-hopping; syntax mirrors Mara’s hyperbolic focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with high density ("rustle of vellum and electronic sighs"). Minor deduction for "observed solitude" scaffold (label reused line 24/42 without deepening), bordering paraphrase loop. No figurative muddle; final line’s "soft sigh of pages turning" crystallizes closure without ornament.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scientific poetry + hyperbolic geometry transforms librarian trope. Scarf’s evolution from "forgotten stanza" to emerald conduit feels inevitable, avoiding derivative safety middle. Risk-taking heightens stakes via "analog memories" premise without gimmickry; emotional truth anchors universals in ledger’s "bridge between measurable and mythic."</comment>
