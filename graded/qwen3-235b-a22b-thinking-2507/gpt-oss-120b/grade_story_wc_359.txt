<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Diagnostic label-speak ("certify wonder as essential") in peak beats triggers -0.5 penalty; motivation told not shown through conflict, no embodied struggle or contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("beauty could be both still and moving"), but cost proof is abstract; Accumulative lens holds though escalation lacks tangible pressure narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ice cavern charges final image ("vessel for aurora’s hues") yet fails 9+ gate—environment doesn’t constrain choices; micro-setting (amber sheet) partially compensates through recurring tactile use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certifying wonder) signaled early but never pressured; Accumulative escalation lacks narrowing of options or felt cost during action—relies on abstract conceptual payoff at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sensory particulars ("oscillating repose," "sculpted hush") without moralizing; final image reweights wonder’s cost via "beauty could be both still and moving" as non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature ("hearing colors as notes") creates distinct rhythmic control; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure’s "promise" resonance without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Figurative density risks overwriting ("tide of luminous chords," "brushstroke that opened fissures") but avoids closure-dulling; minor synonym loops ("colors of the aurora" repetitions) limit higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia/ice/aurora feels inevitable, but "certify wonder" abstraction prevents 9+; risk-taking heightens coherence without gimmickry despite middle-ground hedging on stakes.</comment>
