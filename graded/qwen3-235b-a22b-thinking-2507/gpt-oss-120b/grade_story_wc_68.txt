<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "rationally rebellious" paradox driving the preservation choice, but embodied struggle during the agonizing moment remains cerebral rather than visceral; micro-choices like placing the cog on the notebook reveal value hierarchy with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully with the cog's "common pulse" crystallizing abandonment of singular truth; cost is unmistakable in "agonizing over a single truth is less fruitful," with accumulative/textural lens holding through sedimentary rhythm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The chronometer cog constrains choices and charges the final image relentlessly—from syncing with sediment layers to anchoring the notebook entry; sewer setting's silt directly shapes water management tactics with tactile, lived-in specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency as sediment analysis forces narrative convergence; the cost of sacrificing singular truth crystallizes in the earned renunciation, though external pressure could deepen the dominant stake beyond internal dilemma.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the cog's physical sync with sediment layers, avoiding moralizing until the near-fatal final line "agonizing over a single truth is less fruitful" edges toward thematic echo, slightly dulling the earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature dazzles—"abrasive calm" and "sedimentary layers of silt" reflect the philosopher's mind; rhythmic control under pressure with purposeful repetition taught early, though "rationally rebellious" borders on academic register in peak realization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; "cog placed at the page’s edge" charges closure with crystalline specificity. Minor register drift in "nurturing a chorus of truths" risks thesaurus-itis but stays voice-coherent; propulsion flawless through concrete verbs like "sift" and "churn."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms drowned-city trope through sedimentary archaeology as narrative method; the synthesis of seafarers/subterraneans feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in merging philosophy/engineering elevates stakes without gimmickry, though "rational rebellion" borders on familiar framing.</comment>
