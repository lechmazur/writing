<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority remains poetic but abstract; "quiet rebellion" lacks concrete contradiction beyond humming. Micro-choices like drumming on objects show agency, but emotional progression feels curated rather than organically flawed under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density escalates through drumming intensifying garden responses. Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (sorrow transformed to hope), but escalation lacks one decisive intensification narrowing options earlier in the beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sound wave garden functions as micro-setting; vibrating blossoms constrain Lira’s drumming tactics and charge the final image. Sensory details (humming grass, auric lagoon) are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding static description through action-integrated evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (turning sorrow into shared hope) tightens via drumming’s escalating impact, but pressure lacks visible price paid mid-beat that alters tactics. Cost remains conceptual (sorrow→hope) rather than visceral, weakening escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "sorrow can birth light" crystallizes in the lagoon’s transformation without stated moral. Final image reweights entangled memories as luminous orbs, offering resonant non-literal answer to "shared dream" question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in synesthetic descriptions ("scent of sound wave garden"), but rhythmic control falters in high-pressure beats with repetitive cadence ("each ripple sang... each beat sending..."). No head-hopping; voice modulates effectively with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops in closure beats ("night after night... each shimmering ripple... each drumbeat") dull immediacy. Otherwise high density with strategic telling; no figurative muddle, but cadence shifts lack variation in pivotal drumming sequences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lab-guinea pig trope through sound-wave physics and collective memory. Emotional specificity in "auroral sorrow" avoids generic templates, with risk-taking (non-human POV) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
