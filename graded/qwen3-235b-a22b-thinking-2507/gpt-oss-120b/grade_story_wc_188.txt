<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "serious playfulness" paradox and embodied defiance, but motivation lacks concrete opposition; "gravity of hopelessness" remains abstract without dramatized struggle beyond internal monologue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with the fortress holding "serious playful dream," but cost feels conceptual rather than visceral—no tangible price paid for the triumph beyond abstract "vow," weakening escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Ivy/roses and rag knot create vivid atmosphere, yet setting never pressures choices; fortress blooms "applaud" but don’t constrain tactics, failing Q3’s 9+ gate for environment-driven closure charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes ("defy gravity of hopelessness") intensify through chant/spark rituals, but lack concrete opposition—hopelessness remains ambient rather than testing commitment with visible trade-offs during the firework burst.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges elegantly through mosaic/fireworks synthesis, but final vow ("crafting fireworks that filter sorrow") edges toward thematic echo, slightly undermining earned resonance despite strong "note in mosaic" closure image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice dazzles with lyrical precision ("velvet blank that swallowed hope"), yet "chants while walking" repetition creates subtle cadence loops under pressure, diluting the perceptual signature’s consistency at climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stunning imagery marred by late-third artifacts: "cascade of colored ribbons that spiraled like the kerosene rag knot itself" features mixed metaphor and synonym churn, dulling closure per Text-Artifact Screen.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mosaic/fireworks elevates cliché, but "defying hopelessness" premise lacks risky specificity; emotional truth is beautiful yet safe, avoiding the "bold risk-taking" required for 9+ distinction.</comment>
