<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("grim optimist") manifests in embodied choices like incorporating the die's flaw into proofs; micro-choices under pressure (adjusting incline) reveal value hierarchy. Lacks sufficient physical stress degradation during peak tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: the chipped die's scar becomes "a faint scar turned triumph" reconfiguring perpetual motion. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through mathematical density shifts; cost legible in "deliberate imbalance that paradoxically stabilized."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Staircase functions as micro-setting constraining choices (shifting steps force recalibration); the chipped die charges the final image. Marble arches description slightly ornamental; "breathing" metaphor risks overstatement without deeper physical constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake escalation driven by Aric's agency (programming frame, adjusting incline) narrows options toward mathematical tolerance of flaws. Cost crystallizes in "permanent flaw" acceptance, charging the final image. Motivation intensity could feel more viscerally urgent earlier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the chipped die's transformation from "wounded star" to "imperfection that propelled perpetual motion," rejecting tidy redemption. Final image reweights "boundless confinement" as creative catalyst without moralizing; avoids thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice modulates rhythm with emotional intensity ("dice clicked against the glass" vs. lyrical "circle drawn around a single point"). "Balancedly daring" adverb fits mathematician's lexicon but borders on jargon; minor register drift in "mathematically" during climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops in closure beat; high density ("deliberate imbalance that paradoxically stabilized"). Synonym loop in "whisper of kinetic potential"/"metaphor for boundless confinement" loses 0.3. Final image crystallizes with clean propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms perpetual motion trope through mathematical texture obsession; chipped die mechanic creates fresh emotional calculus. Avoids safety middle by embracing flaw as engine. "Grim optimist" archetype slightly familiar but redeemed by specific execution.</comment>
