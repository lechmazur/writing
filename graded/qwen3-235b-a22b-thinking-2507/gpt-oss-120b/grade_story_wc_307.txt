<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (withholding vs seeking revelation) drives micro-choices like stone placement, but epiphany lacks visible struggle; reverse aging motivation clear yet transformation feels too smooth without earned cost in the climax beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise CR) lands with conceptual cost—reframing reverse aging as gift—but escalation falters; the "withholding" constraint isn't dramatized as active pressure, relying on passive waiting rather than narrowing options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Environment constrains choice: magnetic pull guides Mira's steps through the grotto, and pond rings charge the final image; sycamore motif overused but "iron filings gathering like night moths" offers tactile specificity that shapes her approach.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reverse aging as curse/gift) signaled early, but pressure never tightens—Mira's "withholding" lacks active resistance, and the grotto reveal happens without earned struggle; conceptual cost is felt but not viscerally tested under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "teaching vanishing to appear" crystallizes in the final ripple image without moralizing; conceptual cost (her lifelong struggle inverted) resonates through the stone ritual, avoiding sentimentality via concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cells rewound like moonlit tide") modulates rhythm under pressure, but "sycamore hush" repetition becomes tic-like; deep third POV remains stable, though grotto entrance description risks overwriting with "ozone and ancient bark" density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong propulsion overall, but "sycamore" loops (4x) and mixed metaphor "age peeled away in reverse" muddy peak beats; final line's slight awkwardness ("teach the vanishing to appear") avoids major closure impact but caps high-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reverse aging + magnetic grotto transforms tropes, yet sycamore motif feels like stock symbolism; emotional truth in quiet acceptance earns risk points, but "oak" could swap for "sycamore" without structural loss, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>
