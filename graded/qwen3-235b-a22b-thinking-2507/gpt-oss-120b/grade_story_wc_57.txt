<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("infinitely patient" vs. urgency to preserve) is concrete but cost remains abstract; no visible trade-off for his patience despite "fragile glass of understanding" metaphor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with "weight of centuries" but conceptual cost lacks on-page legibility; no tangible consequence for failure weakens escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Golden dock's snow-fog interplay constrains action (frost-slick rope, glinting wood) and charges final aurora image; micro-setting elevates beyond atmosphere to pressure decoding choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes ("preserve ancient methods") remain abstract despite knot-decoding tension; no credible cost (e.g., time loss, physical strain) materializes to narrow options or alter tactics during escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of patience/resonance emerges through rope-fulgurite symbiosis but final "sow knowledge like seeds" risks thematic echo; wisdom feels earned yet closure lacks irreversible consequence to deepen complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fulgurite sang of storm-born memories") with rhythmic control in decoding sequence; lyrical compression taught early pays off in fog-thickening climax without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Template cadence ("He was... He knelt... He traced") triggers -0.5 penalty; otherwise vivid propulsion, but figurative density ("breath held by sea") occasionally obscures tactile immediacy in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seed-collecting/knot-weaving tropes feels inevitable through specific rope-decoding mechanics; avoids abstraction via fulgurite's physical constraints yet stakes lack transformative risk.</comment>
