<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses; motivation clear but interior conflict superficial. No visible flaw-driven tradeoffs despite strong embodied emotion ("feeling vibrations through damp earth"). Final choice feels earned yet lacks micro-struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost ("chronic hush was not a void but a space waiting to be filled"). Orientation clear by line 3; Accumulative/Textural lens holds. Minor ambiguity in how bowl "sings a chord" slightly weakens cost legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: waterlogged floorboards transmit sound, shipwreck ribs resonate, bowl constrains choices. Charges final image ("copper surface reflecting stars"). Environment actively shapes tactics without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen as violinist transforms silence ("gentle hum that cradled the fire's glow"), but pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation. Conceptual cost legible though tangible tradeoffs absent. Meets one-tightening requirement under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action ("unfinished was a canvas of endless light"), no moralizing. Final image reweights silence as active space. Avoids thematic echo despite "beauty lay not in what was completed" bordering on abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("crackling tongues of flame"), rhythmic control peaks during playing scene ("first note slipped out, soft as a seed"). Zero head-hopping; compression taught early via sensory density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion but "soft" modifier overused ("softly," "soft sigh," "soft as a seed"). No loops or scaffold; final line ("act of unbinding silence") echoes earlier phrase purposefully. Figurative language never muddles closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via acoustic metaphor ("bow hums with memory of wind through dead leaves"). Fresh angle on imperfection avoids sentimentality. Missing one bold risk to reach 9+ band despite organic synthesis.</comment>
