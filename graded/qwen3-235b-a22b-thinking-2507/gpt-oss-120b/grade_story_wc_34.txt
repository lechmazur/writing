<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction under pressure lacks depth; "driftingly alert" shows embodied focus but final endurance lacks visible cost. Micro-choices (wilted vs. sunrise tulip) reveal value hierarchy yet ghost's "satisfaction" feels unearned without character-specific struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (ghost folding into mural), but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the third lightning flash coincidentally triggers resolution, not the tulip imprint's action. Orientation clear by line 5.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Flower press bolt plate functions as micro-setting constraining choices and charging the final image, yet the misty courtyard itself remains decorative; "above clouds" setting fails to pressure tactics or alter options despite spatial potential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through lightning sequence but lack tangible cost—ghost's transformation into "satisfied" mural resolves without trade-off. Balladeer's agency in encoding the tulip feels insufficiently pressured; no path foreclosed beyond abstract "belonging" realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (binary blossoms → humming graffiti), avoiding moralizing. Final image offers resonant answer yet "plea for connection" risks thematic echo; ghost's projection of the balladeer's name edges toward symmetric satisfaction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("harp string" tremors, "tinkersong hues") and rhythmic control under pressure. Register drift mars authenticity—balladeer's archaic role clashes with "algorithm" and "binary sighs" during high-stakes thunder sequences.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops with strong propulsion, yet "tinkersong wonder that stitched sky to earth" suffers mixed metaphor in climax. Technical terms ("fragmented consciousness") blur clarity where concrete sensory detail would heighten pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "ghost in code" as forgotten programmers' consciousness made tangible through flower imprints. Emotional specificity avoids tropes but lacks bold risk-taking; courtyard setting feels derivative of magical realism without non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>
