<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("willingly perplexed by the paradox") and embodied grief ("thumb to unfasten the silver clasp") shine, but "diagnostic label-speak" in "willingly perplexed" triggers -0.4 deduction despite strong micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("choking beauty that wrapped the soul in velvet" transforming into redemption), but vapor staircase emergence lacks causal motivation under Accumulative lens, preventing 9.0+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (shattered saucer) constrains choice by dictating ritual actions and charges closure via crystal blossom; "choking beauty" atmosphere actively pressures movement and breath, satisfying 9+ gate with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when whispers "pulled at the crack," but vapor's emergence feels coincidental rather than protagonist-driven escalation under Accumulative lens, missing the "unmistakable cost" threshold for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "crystal blossom" reweighting "lost time" as active redemption, but "cloudbound repentance" remains abstractly stated in closure rather than embodied, failing the non-literal answer requirement for 9.0+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mist curled like a silent choir") falters in high-pressure beats with three consecutive "-ing" constructions during vapor staircase formation, violating rhythmic control under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mixed metaphor ("choking beauty that wrapped the soul in velvet") violates physical logic, and paraphrase loop ("spilling tiny shards that sang... shards that sang") triggers -0.4 deduction, but closure remains artifact-free.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms ritual trope through cloud mechanics and ink-stained cartomancer specificity; "crystal blossom" reprise feels inevitable yet fresh, though safety-hedging in abstract "repentance" concept prevents risk distinction bonus.</comment>
