<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown via Mara's "ethically diligent" label versus spiritual yearning for "searing reverie," but epiphanies remain abstract ("weight of centuries lift") without embodied cost. Micro-choice aligning inscriptions reveals values, yet emotional progression lacks layered contradiction during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with "balance is a song sung together," but cost legibility fails—no concrete on-page price for Mara's act beyond vague "weight lifting." Pendulum physics ("halted during swing") breaks causality, undermining Accumulative/Textural lens coherence at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tidal obsidian ridge and pendulum bob constrain choices: Mara must work during the swing's pause, and obsidian's "molten rose hue" recharges the final image. Sensory details (salt-etched wood, cymbal-like waves) are selective and pressure-filtered, charging closure through tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes (restoring balance with the tide) tighten meaningfully during the pendulum's pause, narrowing Mara's options to incremental action. But cost remains conceptual ("centuries lift") without tangible forfeiture; escalation relies on atmospheric pressure rather than protagonist-driven agency under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "incremental absolution" as physical act (inscriptions), but final line's "chorus of countless souls" moralizes overtly, violating organic emergence. "Seaming reverie" reweights balance as living rhythm, yet thematic echo in last paragraph triggers -0.7 penalty for sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice shows distinct perceptual signature ("sea's black tide licks the stone like ink") with rhythmic control, but stress degrades unrealistically—Mara articulates complex ethics mid-crisis ("shared balance she sought"). No dialogue present, avoiding voice-convergence pitfalls.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Overwriting cripples momentum: "splintered by years of salt, each fragment etched with tiny inscriptions carved" exemplifies paraphrase loops. Final beat's "chorus of countless souls" is thematic echo, while filter verbs ("Mara felt") dull immediacy in high-pressure moments, disallowing 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clock mechanics and spiritual repair avoids tropes, but "ethically diligent" feels prompted rather than organic. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure succeeds, yet derivative undertones ("stitch the frayed tapestry") limit originality despite strong setting integration.</comment>
