<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation evolves credibly from personal treasure hunt to altruistic sharing, with micro-choices (vial placement, beacon sacrifice) revealing her shifting values. However, internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; panic "unsnarls" too neatly into resolve without layered irrationality during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: Mara’s beacon sacrifice creates undeniable conceptual cost (forfeiting safety for shared hope), validated by the temple’s fish spelling "unsnarl" and the scent’s release. Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently through sensory density shifts, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The temple’s basalt column actively constrains choice when Mara places the vial there, triggering the hush. Final image of shore release charges the setting’s purpose, but micro-setting (vial’s cool surface) could more tightly alter tactics beyond symbolic placement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mara’s agency: battery waning forces beacon sacrifice, narrowing options to "share scent or save self." Cost is unmistakable—beacon fade—reconfiguring her goal from capture to release. Pressure tightens via Accumulative lens without coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "lonesome splendor" reweighted in the final uncorking: the scent’s release answers the central question ("harness the ephemeral") by transforming it into shared, fleeting hope without moralizing. No thematic echo; ambiguity lingers in "temple awaiting the next brave soul."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("HUD flickered," "scent unsnarl panic") sustains rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift in "overriding instinct" explanation risks academic tone, but elision (memory flashes) is taught early and pays off in the hush’s release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose excels in texture ("churned silver to calm amber hush") but has a paraphrase loop: "gathered hush" repeats identically in consecutive sentences near climax, slightly dulling closure propulsion. No figurative muddle, though "lonesome splendor" recurs without sufficient variation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms fantasy tropes through specific, verifiable details (bioluminescent fish spelling glyphs, "moonlit glass" vial). Risk-taking heightens stakes: quiet climax subverts treasure-hunt expectations, with "unsnarl" redefined as communal hope rather than personal power, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
