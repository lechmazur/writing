<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority lacks embodied conflict; Mara’s "exhaustion" from charity work remains abstract despite volcanic setting pressure. No visible struggle with destitution contradicts "meager supplies" label, weakening motivation for detour. Final choice feels unearned as prophecy alignment occurs via convenient fisherman.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (Mara’s future charity gains "uncanny timing"), but fisherman’s prophecy revelation strains Accumulative/Textural lens via coincidence. Orientation clear by line 3, though volcanic rumble escalation lacks causal link to her transformation realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Volcanic grit and glass jar constrain choices (jar trembles/releasing sparks), charging final image. Black sand’s light absorption creates luminous carpet that mirrors celestial dance, directly shaping closure’s "texture of transformation" insight. Sensory hierarchy excels but over-reliance on visual in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("texture of transformation") signaled early but remains abstract until final paragraph; no tangible cost emerges until prophecy alignment. Fisherman’s appearance complicates via coincidence but fails to deepen pressure—his prophecy merely confirms rather than tests Mara’s motivation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Thematic echo in final paragraph ("learned that to understand the texture...") explicitly states the lesson, replacing earned resonance with moralizing. Firefly release charges closure image, but prophecy fulfillment undermines organic emergence by resolving through external validation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in volcanic grit’s warmth and firefly "luminescent chorus," modulating rhythm during transformation realization. However, "vibrant hush" abstraction dilutes POV specificity in climax, and fisherman’s dialogue lacks distinct voice (identical reflective tone).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Overwritten density in peak beats: "whispering hush that seemed to hum with unseen currents" compounds sonic metaphors. Template cadence ("Mara believed... Mara recalled... Mara lifted") dulls immediacy during prophecy reflection, violating propulsion standards for Accumulative design.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of volcanic rebirth with firefly transformation avoids cliché, but "destitute philanthropist" feels derivative without lived detail. Risk-taking in lyric structure succeeds, yet prophecy reliance leans on familiar archetype without sufficient personalization.</comment>
