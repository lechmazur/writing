<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "affectionate detachment" shown through gardener metaphor and measured calculations, but "half truths" motivation lacks embodied friction; micro-choices like sealing the vial reveal hierarchy of values without sufficient struggle against the trade-off of commodifying emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("weight of half truths settle like dust"), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density escalation; orientation anchors within 40 words, though the final courier interaction slightly dilutes the grotto's crystallized pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Amber grotto functions as micro-setting: its static constrains Mara's method (rubbing petal against stone) and charges the final image ("amber light that still lingered in memory"); sensory hierarchy perfectly reflects her professional urgency, with scent and static dominating over visual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harvesting sellable emotion) tightens via Mara's ritual, but pressure lacks visible cost escalation; the "weight of half truths" implies conceptual cost yet feels abstract without concrete forfeiture (e.g., emotional toll on Mara) to charge the closure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of commodified empathy emerges through "subsume" motif and "half truths," with final image ("half truths of the city aligning with her own") offering non-literal answer; avoids moralizing but "bridge between raw insight and empathy" edges toward thematic echo in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("static seemed to taste of old rain") and rhythmic control under pressure; compression of the chemist's backstory taught early via "rogue fragrance chemist" cue, though "affectionate detachment" phrasing momentarily drifts into diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-zero loops with high density, but "static seemed to taste of old rain" risks mixed metaphor (tactile/static vs. gustatory), and "scent of the petal lingering on her skin like a secret promise" leans toward cliché; final image retains clarity despite minor figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "emotion dealer" trope through specific mechanics (static electricity, blotter petals) and moral ambiguity; the synthesis of scent chemistry with emotional commerce feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking (Accumulative lens) heightening stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
