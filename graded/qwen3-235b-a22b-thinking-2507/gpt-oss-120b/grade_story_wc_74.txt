<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara’s insomnia and methodical hope are embodied in her brushstrokes and note-leaving, but her interior contradiction (isolation vs. connection) remains thematic rather than driving concrete choices; Jiro’s reaction feels externally imposed, weakening earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: Mara’s continued painting after Jiro’s departure forecloses isolation with visible cost (her exhaustion, the smog’s "pulse less heavily"), under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost legibility in "city’s smog pulse less heavily" anchors conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The moon-tipped brush constrains tactics (moonlight dependency) and charges the final image ("crescent edge sharpening the brush’s tip"); greenhouse’s glass actively scatters light that enables the magic system, making environment indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Jiro reads the note, but his appearance relies on coincidence resolving the core conflict (proving kindness remembered), violating "coincidence may complicate, not resolve" under Accumulative lens; cost feels earned but escalation lacks Mara’s agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (brush’s glow, folded notes), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "lost languages" as embodied kindness without abstraction, but near-miss on non-literal answer due to slightly overt "sanctuary" phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("saffron quiet," "smog lingered like a heavy sigh") modulates with pressure, but "methodically hopeful" repeats mechanically, flattening voice during high-stakes moments like Jiro’s arrival.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Overwriting in "bristles forged from silvered sap that seemed to capture the moon itself" dilutes momentum; paraphrase loop ("methodically hopeful"/"worked methodically") triggers -0.3, but propulsion recovers before closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Transforms "kindness ripple" trope through linguistic specificity (lost scripts as visual lexicon), but rooftop artist in smoggy city risks familiarity; emotional truth in "cold cup of tea" memory elevates beyond template.</comment>
