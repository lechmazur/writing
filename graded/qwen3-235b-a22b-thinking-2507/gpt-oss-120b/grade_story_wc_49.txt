<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lacks flaw-driven struggle; Mara succeeds seamlessly without internal contradiction complicating choices beyond abstract "vow." Motivation clear but missing blind spots that compound choices, reducing felt cost despite strong embodied emotion ("resonance vibrate within her chest").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with legible cost ("sealed vow" pollen settling on shoulders), but persistent constraint shaping tactics absent. Accumulative lens holds as moon's ascent tightens pressure via sensory density, though orientation clarity by line 3 avoids penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory specificity ("dew," "copper-capped finger") anchors setting, but arbor environment never constrains choices or alters tactics. Micro-setting (lyre, vine) enriches atmosphere yet fails the 9+ gate by not charging the final image causally—rustling canopy mirrors theme but lacks pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore rites before moonrise) tightens via moon's ascent, with agency-driven escalation (lyre adjustments deepen ritual). Cost ("sealed vow" pollen) is felt but slightly abstract; physical burden on shoulders lacks visceral consequence to elevate beyond strong execution under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "remedy for loss lay not in steel or fire, but in memory sung" crystallized through children learning to listen. Final image reweights "forgotten songs" as living practice without moralizing, avoiding sentimentality via concrete action ("whispered melodies in the vines").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (tinkerer's focus on tools/sound) and rhythmic control shine: lyrical flow during ritual, compressed syntax at climax ("The harvest moon burst..."). Zero head-hopping; peak stress narrows to tactile details ("copper-capped finger," "resonance vibrate within her chest").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with minor redundancy ("golden threads... spinning golden stories"). No closure-dulling artifacts, but "forest seemed to smile" edges toward cliché, slightly diluting final image. Propulsion strong through varied syntax and purposeful concrete nouns ("brass instrument," "glowing pollen").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms ritual trope via specific tinkerer lens (copper caps, brass lyre) and emotional truth: magic as reenactment, not invention. Risk-taking in quiet climax (pollen as covenant) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable through prior particulars like "vines sang only when moon’s silver turned gold."</comment>
