<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Interiority lacks concrete embodiment; "mildly obsessed" is stated not demonstrated through micro-choices under pressure. No visible cost or contradiction in the oracle's endurance, rendering the final stance unmotivated despite vivid atmosphere.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands but cost remains abstract; "map dissolving into air" lacks tangible consequence. Two distinct non-closure issues (cost ambiguity + lens consistency at climax) trigger -1.5 cap from 8.6 baseline.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fort actively constrains choices (sheltering ritual during gale) and the breath-as-tool charges the final image. "Marbled hush" evolves from atmosphere to embodied action ("sealing map within breath"), meeting Q3 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes remain poetic abstraction ("charting void") without concrete cost; storm pressure intensifies atmospherically but doesn't narrow options through oracle's agency. Escalation lacks felt trade-off despite lyrical density.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing but "endless night" theme stays abstract; final image ("dissolve into marbled hush") echoes early motifs without reweighting meaning. Misses Q5 9+ test by lacking resonant non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ambered hush of forgotten tides") and rhythmic control under storm pressure. Minor flaw: "mildly obsessed" label slightly disrupts voice consistency in high-stakes moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero closure artifacts but mid-story paraphrase loops ("gale curled... rattling battlements" then "storm intensified... rain lashing") and one strained metaphor ("whispering equations"). Prevents 9+ eligibility per global rules.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mapmaking trope through sensory specificity ("salt and ambered hush" as navigational tools). Avoids derivative mysticism via concrete ritual actions, but risk-taking doesn't fully heighten stakes beyond poetic resonance.</comment>
