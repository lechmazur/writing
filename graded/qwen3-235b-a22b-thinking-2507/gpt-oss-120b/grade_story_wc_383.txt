<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident (skeptic seeking solace) but "quarantined memory" backstory lacks causal pressure; epiphany feels unearned as the seashell's role remains mystical rather than driving tangible choices under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (shell's dimming pulse = sacrifice of sorrow), but orientation fails—gender/location unclear past 120 words, capping potential; Accumulative lens holds though causality remains atmospheric.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Violet garden constrains choice only abstractly (roses as "pale hands"), missing 9+ gate; seashell’s physicality charges the final image, but sensory details often ornamental ("velvet" over tactile specificity).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes (isolation→independence) deepen through seashell’s resonance but lack tangible pressure; cost is felt (pulse dimming) yet escalation remains atmospheric without narrowing Lira’s options beyond internal shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically via seashell’s transformation ("sorrow into strength"), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights quarantine as "living library," though "ghostly resolve" borders on thematic echo in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fragrant air weaving through vines like ghostly resolve") with rhythmic control, but "resonance structures" repetition creates subtle voice convergence under emotional peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Overwriting in high-pressure beats: "tragically radiant" (x3) and "resonance structures" (x5) form synonym loops; lyrical density obscures causality though final image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pandemic isolation with lyrical alchemy, yet "quarantined memory" risks derivative premise; emotional truth elevates beyond tropes but lacks one bold risk-taking turn to breach 8.5.</comment>
