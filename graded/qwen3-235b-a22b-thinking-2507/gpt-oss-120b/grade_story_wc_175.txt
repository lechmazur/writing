<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority concrete but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; "whispered promise" shows motivation yet no visible internal struggle during pivotal knot-tying. Micro-choices absent when structures dissolve—endurance feels passive rather than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) valid but cost illegible; "structures dissolve with sunrise" states loss abstractly without on-page emotional or tactical consequence. Missing exact sentence where cost lands per rubric's cost proof test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Grotto functions as micro-setting: bioluminescent moss and reeds directly constrain knot-building tactics and charge the final image ("outlines etched in memory of sky"). Environment shapes every choice, hitting Q3's 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>No protagonist-driven escalation; monarchs' departure happens independently, leaving Lira reactive. Her knot-tying lacks narrowing options or trade-offs—pressure from migration is atmospheric, not causal under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme resonates through "fleeting threads" motif but capped by Q4's escalation failure; "ripples forward" ending avoids moralizing yet lacks the non-literal answer Q5's 9+ test requires due to passive conflict resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice distinctive ("blushing stillness" cadence) but density overwhelms clarity in climax; "amber veil that made the grotto blush" repeats tone without modulation under pressure, violating perceptual signature requirement.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Overwriting in final beat: 5 consecutive metaphorical phrases ("soft glow," "lingering knot," "dewy poetry") trigger density penalty. Paraphrase loops ("blushing stillness" x3) dull closure's momentum per Text-Artifact Screen.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "esoteric realist" with physical ritual avoids cliché, but middle-ground hedging in risk-taking; poetic safety prevents the bold structural choice Q8's 9+ test demands for emotional specificity.</comment>
