<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses (doubts/dreams) but "tremor of certainty" lacks escalation; micro-choices under pressure remain abstract without embodied cost scaling to closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with conceptual cost (old prohibitions folding like paper), but "tremor of certainty" repetition creates minor escalation drag; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Frozen lake’s boundary dissolution directly charges closure ("water/air dissolve like sugar"), yet cobalt atrium functions more as backdrop than constraint; quartz colonnade’s hue shift lacks causal pressure on choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dissolving boundaries) tightens through paraphrasing, but "tremor of certainty" deepening feels repetitive; cost (prohibitions folding) is conceptual yet unmistakable in final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through boundary dissolution imagery, but final line’s "boundaries meant to be explored" risks thematic echo; avoids moralizing via star-tapestry reflection charging closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lantern-moth hush," "brushstroke syllables") modulates rhythm under pressure; no head-hopping, though "cloud-shadow poet" label slightly flattens interiority in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion falters with paraphrase loops ("tremor of certainty" x4); "watercolor of doubts" strains metaphor coherence, yet final image ("verse hangs like frost") achieves crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms boundary trope through quartz/ice physics; "sugar in tea" dissolution feels fresh, but "amber lake defying chill" edges toward symbolic convenience without deeper causal integration.</comment>
