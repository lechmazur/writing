<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lacks interior contradiction; motivation ("preserve weight") is clear but static with no meaningful change or flaw-complicated choices. Strength: embodied emotion in "cold hinge settle against skin," but final endurance lacks earned cost escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation perfect ("blooming jetty at twilight" anchors early), closure as Charged Poise crystallizes covenant renewal, but cost remains abstract ("reverence for tiny moments") without concrete on-page price. Escalation via tide turning lacks protagonist-driven tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jetty functions as micro-setting: "crimson and white flowers unfurled like ink strokes" constrains perception and charges closure ("promise settle like dew"). Minor flaw: "melancholy and hope" tells rather than embodies mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (covenant preservation) signaled early, but pressure from tide/context changes doesn't narrow options—protagonist merely writes without altered tactics. Cost ("haunted euphoria") is felt but not unmistakable; agency lacks trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "history beats in smallest things" earns resonance via locket’s "cool metal pulse," avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights premise without abstraction, though "luminous reminder" edges toward tell.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("violet and amber steeped sighs of sea") with rhythmic control, but "haunted euphoria" repetition (4x) creates subtle tic under pressure. No head-hopping; compression taught early pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density marred by scaffolding: "perfume of salt and memory" redundantly follows "steep the sighs of sea." Template cadence in "He moved... each step..." dulls immediacy, though closure image ("dew on soul") remains pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms memory trope via walnut ink/locket rituals; emotional specificity in "dread and delight" duality avoids safety middle. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes coherently without gimmickry.</comment>
