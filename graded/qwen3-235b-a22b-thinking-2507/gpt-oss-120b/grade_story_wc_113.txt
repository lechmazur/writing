<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to "unravel the code" is clear and embodied through Mara's tracing of water patterns, but internal conflict lacks layered contradiction beyond reverence—no competing impulses like fear of failure versus obsession weaken the 9+ gate. Final chord press earns closure, yet cost remains abstract (ghost's departure) without visceral character-specific sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: lanterns steadying after the chord reveals cost (ghost's dissolution as "presence fading like mist"), with the dry program proving conceptual reweighting. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—water patterns intensify density until the silence-revelation reconfigures meaning with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The flooded opera house constrains every choice: swollen violin forces adaptation, water ripples as staff lines directly enable the climax, and the receding river charges the final image. Micro-setting (antique program) evolves from warped relic to dry testament, meeting the 9+ gate by altering tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through textural accumulation (water patterns → shifting symbols), but escalation lacks protagonist-driven friction—Mara discovers rather than earns the solution. Cost is felt ("ghost seemed to smile... fading") yet ambiguous; the ghost's departure lacks concrete tradeoff Mara actively chooses, missing the 8.8+ band guardrail.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: "in between spaces" evolves from physical gaps to musical silences, reweighted in closure as the ghost's true message. Final image (dry program, calm amber light) answers the central question without moralizing—pure earned resonance where silence holds meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("amber light trembling like breath on wet wood"), but phrases like "unplayed notes hung like ghosts" flirt with cliché. Under pressure, syntax tightens effectively ("She pressed the final chord..."), though "reverence" slightly abstracts the climax's emotional texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "water ripples on the floor responded" avoids filter verbs while advancing plot. Minor density dip in opening ("trembling" x2) deducts 0.3, but payoff justifies it—climax avoids figurative muddle with visceral clarity ("lanterns steadied, their light no longer trembling").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms ghost-story tropes through water-as-notation, committing fully to poetic logic. "Silences as code" subverts expectations with emotional specificity, avoiding middle-ground hedging. One deduction: prima donna backstory feels familiar despite strong integration.</comment>
