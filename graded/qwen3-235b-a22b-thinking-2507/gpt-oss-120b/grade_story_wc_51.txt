<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character remains purely symbolic vessel; no interior contradiction or embodied conflict beyond ritual performance. "Whispered to each weight" lacks specific emotional contradiction, reducing motivation to thematic function rather than character-driven choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Orientation test fails: who/where unclear past 120 words ("cavernous seashell" offers no spatial anchor), triggering -0.3 penalty. Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost ("forgotten promise slipping into flame"), but Accumulative lens lacks meaningful pressure escalation beyond atmospheric density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Bronze grotto functions as micro-setting: moon-aligned lamp orientation constrains ritual tactics, and calcified water statues charge the final image ("constellation of tiny whales"). Sensory details ("mineral smoke," "shingled hush") are purpose-driven and filtered through weaver's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (releasing sorrow) remains abstract; no viscerally felt pressure or narrowing of options. Ritual mechanics ("air still as sea's depth") create procedural tension but lack emotional trade-offs or earned cost escalation beyond conceptual transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through calcification-as-art motif, but final paragraph's explicit promise ("any soul who entered... let it calcify into art") triggers Thematic Echo penalty (-0.5), undermining earned resonance with near-sermonizing language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("whalebone reverie," "shingled hush") maintains consistent lyrical rhythm under pressure. Voice modulates effectively during ritual climax ("thrumbmed," "crystal that hung like drop of midnight"), with no POV leakage despite poetic compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Severe overwriting: 72% of high-pressure beats deploy stacked metaphors ("eyes braided with patterns of light," "dreamlike fog of memory"), triggering -0.7 penalty. "Shingled hush" repetition (5x) crosses into scaffold without sufficient pattern payoff, dulling closure's emotional charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of geological and emotional processes ("calcify into art"), but ritual framework feels archetypal. Transformation test fails: swap "grotto" for "temple" and core mechanics remain unchanged, limiting specificity despite vivid "constellation of tiny whales" inflection.</comment>
