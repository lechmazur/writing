<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (isolation vs connection) is clear but embodied emotion remains abstract; "tender shadow keeper" label overpowers specific micro-choices during threshold encroachment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visible cost (ring left behind), but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural vs Hybrid) weakens escalation; "burning bridges" repetition dilutes pressure tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ashen walls constraining choice via starlight fractures charge the final image; "doorknocker ring" as micro-setting evolves from echo to key to relic with tactile purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (teaching darkness to breathe) tightens through encroachment beats, but "burning bridges" lacks visible tactical cost; pressure accumulates without narrowing options sufficiently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through scar-veins and ring relic without moralizing; final image reweights "loaded emptiness" as charged quiet, avoiding thematic echo in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "stitched darkness" and "luminescent veins," but psychic distance wavers between intimate ("warmed by his pulse") and detached ("within this hollowed hall").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to inhale," "sensed an audience") in high-pressure beats dull immediacy; paraphrase loops ("burned bridges carefully" x2) trigger -0.5 penalty in climax sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of "scars as conduits" transforms isolation trope; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry despite minor prose muddle.</comment>
