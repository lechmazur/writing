<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete action ("traced swirling patterns, recording each shift") and embodied emotion ("weight of each vow settle onto her shoulders") avoids therapy-speak. Final renunciation of oblivion feels earned through meticulous measurement ritual, though contradictory impulses lack simultaneous tension during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "memory, measured gently, could outlast oblivion" crystallizes options through the awakened slide's constellation. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—frequency measurements tighten meaning-making pressure with each shift, narrowing options to the ledger's hum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The glacial marble pedestal isn't décor but constraint—the slide's activation requires its cold surface, charging the final constellation. Ice library actively shapes tactics: frequencies shift with the library's "exhale," making environment indispensable to closure's luminous map.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (memory vs. oblivion) tighten through the chief's agency: measuring frequencies transforms vapor into testimony. Cost is legible in "weight of each vow" becoming a map, not burden. Pressure accumulates via the slide's pulse resonating with her heartbeat—a single deepening that reconfigures stakes under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the ledger's "quartz hush" glimmer recharging the opening library description, avoiding moralizing. Final whisper reweights "luminous vows" as active preservation ("memory... could outlast oblivion"), with conceptual cost made undeniable by the silence's answer—no thematic echo, pure earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "frequencies shifted as the library exhaled"—character-specific bias in noticing data as breath. Rhythm modulates perfectly: short phrases during pulse resonance ("single pulse... echoing her heartbeat") contrast lyrical buildup, with no head-hopping in this single-POV tour de force.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("quartz hush settled like snowfall on her shoulders" echoes earlier descriptions) dulls closure's edge. Otherwise, propulsion is flawless: "shedding shards of silver that pierced the library's ceiling like needles of revelation" does triple duty advancing plot, atmosphere, and theme without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms library tropes through the book spine frequency device—a fresh inflection where data becomes sacred. Emotional truth in "personal pilgrimage toward forgotten syllables" avoids generic nostalgia; specificity of glacial marble pedestal and ledger hum creates irreplaceable authenticity.</comment>
