<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; motivation ("decode universal riddle") remains abstract without embodied struggle against tangible limits. Selene’s epiphany feels unearned as her curiosity faces no active resistance beyond atmospheric melancholy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: "myths survive when retold through art" reweights the premise with conceptual cost (fixed truth sacrificed for fluid meaning). Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density increase in resonant hums, though escalation lacks one decisive intensification beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Abandoned observatory functions as micro-setting—cracked dome and ledger constrain discovery—but fails to charge the final image meaningfully. Sensory details (shifting shell colors, cello vibrations) vividly filter through Selene’s myth-busting lens yet don’t alter tactics beyond passive observation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (how myths endure) tightens via the shell-led ledger discovery, but pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation. Selene’s agency is reactive (following clues), not active; cost (accepting truth’s fluidity) feels intellectual rather than visceral, weakening stakes’ emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the shell’s transformation from "talisman" to "heart," avoiding moralizing. Final image ("symphony of gloom turned bright") resonates non-literally with the riddle’s answer, though "stubborn optimism" edges toward thematic echo without sufficient counterweight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in synesthetic descriptions ("hum turned strings into conduits"), but "gloomy cheerfulness" recurs as unearned label rather than embodied contradiction. Voice modulates effectively under pressure, though reflection on Dr. Hale risks over-explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose loops mar momentum: "resonant hums" repeats identically across beats, and "gloomy cheerfulness" appears 4x with minimal variation. Strong textural specificity ("colors shifting like sunrise on a stormy sea") is undermined by paraphrase cycles in the cello’s description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of myth-busting with sonic archaeology elevates tropes, but "ephemeral compass" feels derivative of magical realism templates. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off via the CR closure, though observatory setting lacks specific verifiable detail to avoid generality.</comment>
