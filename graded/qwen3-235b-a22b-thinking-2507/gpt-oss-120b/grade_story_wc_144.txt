<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s blindness isn’t a label but a lived constraint driving her tactile ingenuity; her contradictory impulses—crafting precision while acknowledging the drone’s "slight lag"—manifest in micro-choices like water-refraction examination. Final data recording earns endurance with visible cost (the lag as a future burden), avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options: Mara’s "magnetic calm" reconfigures the drone’s purpose with conceptual cost (the lag as an unavoidable data point). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation; anchor clanging’s vibration echoing in her chest makes cost legible without melodrama.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The water basin isn’t decorative—it constrains Mara’s repair method, forcing her to "examine light refraction" to map the tear. Mist transforms light into a "precise measuring tool," directly charging the final image where she traces the wing’s "subtle curvature" matching "water’s refracted arcs."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation via sensory deepening: water’s ripples reveal hidden membrane curvature, narrowing options to the polymer patch. The "slight lag" is a felt price altering future tactics (noted in her data log), with Mara’s agency driving the tightening—no coincidence resolves the tear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the drone’s repair as a "bridge between broken things and new horizons," never stated outright. The final image—"drone hover[ing] above rail tracks," syncing with train clatter—resonantly answers the central question: broken precision guides journeys, with the lag’s cost reweighting "luminous futures."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: Mara’s world is sound/vibration/scent ("soft whirr," "vapor’s quiet partnership"), not sight. Rhythmic control under pressure—short, tactile phrases during repair ("applied the thin polymer strip, it adhered... with a quiet sigh")—avoids head-hopping while modulating intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Minor density slip: "magnetic calm" repetition slightly blurs focus in the climax beat. Otherwise, propulsion is flawless—e.g., "vapor had turned ordinary illumination into a precise measuring tool" compresses setting/theme. Closure image ("drone’s tiny propellers whispered in sync with distant clatter") avoids muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Blind artisan repairing a drone via water-refraction is a fresh synthesis: the method feels necessary, not gimmicky. Risk-taking heightens stakes—her blindness transforms tech into tactile artistry—while the drone’s "slight lag" avoids sentimental triumph, grounding ingenuity in earned limitation.</comment>
