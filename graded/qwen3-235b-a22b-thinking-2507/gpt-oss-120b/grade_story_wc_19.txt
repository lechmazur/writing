<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority excels with embodied contradiction ("fear dissolve like chalk in rain"), but flaw integration lacks depth—claustrophobia's cost isn't tested beyond dissolution during climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "heart no longer cramped but expanding" crystallizes cost via spatial reconfiguration. Lens (Accumulative) holds; gravity snapback dissolves filaments with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Doll's amber eyes constrain choice (limiting exposure) and charge closure ("porcelain pulse with gilded hush"), but xenial trellis remains ornamental—no pressure on tactics during ascent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation ("sour bite... sweet aftertaste"), yet escalation lacks narrowing—no moment where exposure limit risks failure, missing Band 8.8+ requirement for visible price altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "cramped space could hold vastness of sky" reweights premise without moralizing. Final lullaby charges closure, but "gilded hush" concept stays abstract, not tactically binding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("breath echoing off stone like trapped sigh"), but "intangibly tangible" feels authorial, not child-POV; final "sprout a universe" verges on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stunning imagery marred by closure-beat loop: "filaments dissolved... leaving behind only lingering scent" followed by "retrieved the doll, now warm"—redundant phrasing dulls cost legibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Flavors of silence" transforms cliché through concrete tasting metaphors, but inverted gravity feels convenient—not organically tied to bunker logic, safety-hedging risk.</comment>
