<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong (dirty past vs empathy quest), but mirror acceptance lacks struggle; final choice feels unearned as micro-choices don't reveal value hierarchy during pivotal toss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "trusting dirty past as compass not chain" crystallizes stance with felt cost of "feeling weight of sorrow"; Accumulative lens holds via patterned imagery tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent lake constrains choices (newspaper lines guide path, kelp hides crate) and charges final image ("water itself felt compassion"); micro-setting drives climax via water-toss mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Empathy stake deepens via mirror vision, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the vision is received, not fought for; cost is felt yet not earned through active choice in pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through baseball/mirror objects without moralizing; final line reweights "dirty past" as compass, but "Empathy is a seed" quote risks thematic echo despite diegetic framing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("newspaper lines floated like ghostly headlines") with rhythmic control; no POV drift despite lyrical compression, and elision taught via "coded messages" early payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Filter-verb stacks ("I learned," "I recognized," "I felt") in high-pressure beats dull immediacy; otherwise vivid prose with strong cadence, but scaffold prevents 8.0+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neural reset tropes via time-travel baseball and soul-mirror; specificity ("T. Traveler, 2199," phosphor-scaled fish) avoids derivativeness despite familiar redemption frame.</comment>
