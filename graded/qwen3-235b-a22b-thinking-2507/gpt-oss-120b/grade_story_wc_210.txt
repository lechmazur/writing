<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; alchemist’s resolve is unwavering without simultaneous doubt or fear. "Rejected false comfort" stated but not tested through micro-choices during bottle dissolution. Interiority remains resolute rather than conflicted, missing earned vulnerability at pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (emotional labor of remembering), but bottle dissolution to town revival lacks sufficient causal buildup. Accumulative lens holds, yet the transition from "cork dissolved into mist" to streets lighting up feels unearned by prior pressure, diluting escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Paper lanterns function as micro-setting that charges the final image ("lanterns reflected new households") and constrains revival method. Sensory details (rice paper flicker, amber hum) are purposeful and evolve with the alchemist’s actions, avoiding static description through tactile integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes (revival through memory) tighten meaningfully as alchemist recalls "forgotten name, lost song," but pressure lacks visceral escalation. The absence of a concrete setback during mental construction—no failed recollection or memory resistance—softens the cost, leaving stakes feeling abstract despite thematic weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Final image ("lanterns flickered low") reweights the opening’s "bruised sky" with earned hope, avoiding moralizing. Theme emerges through "fragile glass of remembered desire" reprise, transforming the amber bottle’s physicality into conceptual cost without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in texture-focused lexicon ("skeleton of boarded windows," "humming with memory"), but stress-response compression falters during climax. Sentences like "reimagined an entire civilization without false promises" lapse into abstract assertion, disrupting rhythmic control under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose soars in specificity ("cracked jars refilled with ideas"), yet paraphrase loops emerge in revival sequence: "lanterns reflected new households" followed by "soft glow testament to recalled intention" restates without advancing momentum. Figurative muddle in "fragile glass of remembered desire" strains closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms revival tropes through "working memory" specificity, but "amber bottle with no opening" echoes mythic containers without fresh inflection. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes, yet safety-hedging in the alchemist’s flawless execution limits emotional complexity.</comment>
