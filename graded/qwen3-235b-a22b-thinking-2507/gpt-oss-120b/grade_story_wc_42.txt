<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("prayer repeated," "luminous ache") without contradictory impulses; endurance is earned but cost lacks visceral embodiment during quake pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("weight of centuries lift"); Accumulative lens holds through sound-density escalation to the leaf-triggered chime.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Brass cradle and leaf-fall sound constrain repair tactics; lunar observatory’s "luminous ache" directly charges the final image’s transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation via accumulating environmental pressure (shaking foundations, sound ribbons) narrows options to the leaf-sound trigger; cost legible in lifted centuries but agency-driven deepening is subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image ("leaf fell again... steer celestial machinery") reweights "ephemeral pulse" without moralizing; theme emerges from starlight filament and repaired hand’s evolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ribbons of sound," "filament of starlight") modulates rhythm under quake pressure; no head-hopping despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion but "luminous ache" repetition (5x) risks synonym churn; "changelessly constant" stated without embodied demonstration in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cosmic repair trope transformed via escape velocity mechanics; "humble act that resembled a prayer" crystallizes emotional specificity without abstraction.</comment>
