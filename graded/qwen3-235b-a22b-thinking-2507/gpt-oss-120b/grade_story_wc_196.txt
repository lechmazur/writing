<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority leans on abstract hope ("tactfully hopeful," "solidarity") without sufficient embodied contradiction; supervisor interaction lacks status tension despite visible micro-choices with the button. Epiphany feels earned but emotional calibration is too tidy for "broken heart" stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (dust patterns rising for new file), but button's magic mechanics ("projected silhouettes") lack internal logic under Accumulative lens, weakening causality. Cost is felt ("heart stitching itself back together") yet not viscerally legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dust functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (tracing patterns, projecting stories) and charges closure (rising for new tale). File room details ("oak desk," "high windows") filter through Amelia's archival bias with sensory precision, avoiding static catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under Accumulative lens: button discovery → supervisor buy-in → new file activation. Cost (emotional labor of "broken heart") deepens through tactile details (button's weight, dust swirls), but pressure lacks tangible opposition beyond bureaucratic erasure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (red balloon sketch, tarnished button), not abstraction. Final image reweights "unknown histories" via child's drawing—love "still bright" without moralizing—achieving resonant non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust rose like silent flag," "pulse of empathy") shines, but filter verbs ("she realized," "she felt") dilute immediacy in high-pressure beats. Rhythm falters with repetitive "unfurl" cadence during projection sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("unfurling like a silent flag" → "unfurl another tale") and borderline cliché ("trembling like hope") reduce propulsion. No fatal artifacts, but syntactic monotony in final paragraph dulls closure's emotional charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Transforms foster care trope through archival lens—button as historical conduit feels fresh. Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off, but "broken-hearted archivist" edges toward archetype without sufficient specificity to avoid template feel.</comment>
