<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between "earthbound" longing and star-watching remains abstract; embodied struggle in "weighing breath against glass" shows micro-choice but lacks visceral cost escalation under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with spiral completion reweighting "light without fire" through "memory of forgotten star" cost; minor lens ambiguity in chant moment prevents 9.0 despite Accumulative density buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sea glass functions as micro-setting charging closure, but grotto walls remain atmospheric backdrop without constraining choices; "water pool" mirroring galaxies nearly elevates to 9-band constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via meditation's conceptual cost ("weight of peace"), but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure; passive arrangement of glass misses opportunity for tactical trade-offs under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image reweights "light without fire" as "softest glow... illuminate without burning" with undeniable conceptual cost; avoids moralizing while making "zephyr bloom" a resonant answer to central illumination question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in light/reflection noticing ("eyes reflecting cosmos"), but "concept that promised calm" drifts into academic register during peak pressure of chant sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>No scaffold loops, but "reflectively vibrant" repetition (3x) and near-strained metaphor "glass sang a soft zephyr bloom" create minor density artifacts in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic longing made tangible through sea glass physics; transforms "light without fire" trope via concrete polishing/arranging acts that heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
