<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Clear motivation but lacks interior contradiction; no visible flaw complicates the choice. Micro-choices absent as locksmith follows star passively. "Unassumingly bold" trait remains label-only without testing or cost. Non-closure accumulation cap applied for single distinct issue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost: "disorienting darkness was merely a canvas" reconfigures stakes through the locksmith's resolve. Orientation clear by line 30 (shadowed nexus, starlight). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, but Q4 failure caps high-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lock of hair functions as micro-setting: constrains choice (ribbon matching groove) and charges final image (untied reminder). Silvered cobblestones pressure tactics by disorienting him. Evolving nexus ("veil lifting") causally integrates with action. Q4 failure caps high-band despite meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stakes lack escalation; star "hint" coincidentally resolves conflict without protagonist agency. Wind reveals groove arbitrarily, undercutting pressure accumulation. No narrowing of options or visible cost during key beats. Non-closure accumulation cap applied for single distinct issue.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Final filament image offers non-literal answer to "fear binding ideas" without moralizing. Theme emerges from concrete particulars (ribbon untying = "patience and intention"). Q4 ≤6.9 caps Q5 per cross-cap rule, blocking higher thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: cosmos filtered through "improbable longing" ("air hummed with unnamed possibilities"). Rhythm modulates under pressure (short phrases during disorientation). Q4 failure caps high-band despite controlled lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("disorienting him with every stride. Each step echoed...") but zero closure artifacts. High density with clear propulsion; "doubts sway and dissolve" avoids cliché. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Derivative premise (cosmic idea-liberation) lacks transformation; swap "locksmith" for "poet" and arc remains identical. "Ribbon of intention" adds freshness but no bold risk-taking. Derivative premise guardrail penalty applied.</comment>
