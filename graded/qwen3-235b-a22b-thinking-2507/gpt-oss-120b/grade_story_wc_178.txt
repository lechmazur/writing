<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "frugality" stated but not embodied through specific choices under pressure. Final covenant sealing feels unearned without visible struggle or cost, violating Earned Stasis requirements for this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test failure: unclear time anchor past 120 words ("waning amber of a dusk" insufficient). Closure (violet glow) lacks visible cost—no forfeiture or struggle—and feels coincidental rather than earned through causality, violating Accumulative/Textural lens requirements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details ("dust-laden archives," "wind-chimed arches") but setting remains decorative backdrop; palace exerts zero pressure on choices. Micro-setting potential in tile/schematics fails to constrain tactics, capping near band limit despite atmospheric strength.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>No tangible escalation: "between regimes" timeframe never tightens decisions (no clock, no consequences), and cosmic stakes remain abstract. Resolution requires zero agency beyond tracing lines; no visible price paid for covenant sealing under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme stated overtly ("binding humanity to the unknown") rather than emerging from particulars. "Empirically ironic" labeling triggers Thematic Echo penalty; glyphs-as-motif lack causal weight until final paragraph, preventing resonant closure reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct rhythmic texture ("waning amber of a dusk") but uniform ornate syntax persists under ritual pressure, violating stress-modulation principle. "Frugal astronomer" descriptor repeats as tic; no perceptual signature beyond "measuring" metaphors.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("empirically ironic" x3 with near-identical phrasing) and stacked modifiers ("soft violet glow rose, forming a bridge of light") obscure closure. Template cadence ("He worked... He set out... He returned") dulls ritual climax, violating Overwriting Checks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Tropes (ancient artifact + astronomy = cosmic connection) lack transformation; "frugal" angle remains superficial label. Specific glyphs in future charts offer fresh inflection but arrive too late to reshape core premise organically.</comment>
