<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation (asylum proof via ink) is clear but internal conflict between con artist legacy and honesty lacks contradictory impulses in action; passive waiting replaces meaningful choice under pressure, weakening earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) reconfigures asylum as "living covenant" with conceptual cost (bureaucratic rigidity dissolving), but the cost remains abstract—no tangible personal sacrifice on-page weakens final impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Funeral home prep room’s sensory details (lilies, incense, fog) anchor atmosphere early, yet micro-setting fails to constrain choices; ink pot’s final clink charges the image but doesn’t shape prior tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes (asylum proof) tighten via grief’s pressure, but escalation relies on coincidence (mourners’ sighs) rather than Mara’s agency; cost is bureaucratic, not personal, missing band guardrail for high 8.0s.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of fairness through perception shift emerges organically; final image ("death and vitality twin vessels") reweights premise without moralizing, avoiding Thematic Echo while embracing moral ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice shows distinct perceptual signature ("grief a palpable pressure... felt in soles of feet"), with rhythmic control deepening under stress; minor therapy-speak ("liquefying rigid doubts") barely avoids Q7 penalty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but "liquid light, spreading like veins of gold" edges into overwriting; no loops in closure beat preserves momentum and clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of asylum and magical realism feels inevitable, yet "con artist’s honest child" trope lacks transformative specificity; emotional truth elevates but avoids true risk-taking.</comment>
