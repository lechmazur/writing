<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses; Mara's "quiet duty" lacks internal conflict despite high stakes. Final choice (playing harp) feels inevitable rather than earned through prior causality, with Mr. Harlan reduced to passive recipient.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Earned Stasis (acceptance of transformation) with conceptual cost in "warm vinyl" testament. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, but "scent of hope" feels ungrounded until payoff, slightly weakening cost legibility at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Broken vinyl fragment functions as micro-setting that charges the final image ("warm from moment’s music") and constrains choice (its crackle "completes" the song). Avoids white-room syndrome through tactile, lived-in use across beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (flawless goodbye) tightens via vinyl’s crackle "completing" the song, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—Mara’s actions feel predetermined rather than pressured choices. Cost (transformation over loss) is felt but not viscerally tied to her tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through vinyl’s "wholeness from brokenness," with final image ("hope stitched together") offering resonant non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing, though "scent of hope" borders on thematic echo in mid-beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (musical metaphors) shines, but filter-verbs pile up under stress ("Mara felt," "she sensed"), dulling immediacy during pivotal death moment. Consistent voice despite ornate lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with lyrical propulsion, but figurative language overloads peak beats (e.g., "kite catching first wind of dawn" during death). No loops, yet "decisively kind" repetition and template cadence in final paragraph slightly obscure closure’s emotional cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hospice ritual with vinyl’s tactile symbolism transforms a familiar premise. Emotional specificity avoids sentimentality, though "radiant haven" risks cliché. Risk-taking (lyric closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
