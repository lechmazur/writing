<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Queen's motivation clear but lacks contradictory impulses; transformation feels abrupt without genuine struggle against internal flaws. "Crown as burden-turned-key" symbolism not earned through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with legible cost ("dreams dissolved like frost"), but escalation lacks meaningful pressure—grotto sequence features no active opposition or trade-offs, weakening causal integrity under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Environment constrains choices (steep path, pulsing walls) and charges final image; "crystal basin reflecting dreams" integrates setting with thematic closure. Minor generic phrasing ("pallid moons") prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (end restless nights) signaled early but pressure never escalates meaningfully; queen faces zero resistance in grotto, resolving conflict via coincidence (orb bursts on touch) rather than agency-driven trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "recurring dream as map" reframing, avoiding moralizing. Final vow to "watch over the ridge" offers resonant answer, but insight lacks deeper ambiguity about "tempered by starlight" cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("stone shimmered like liquid sapphire") with rhythmic control, but "shared exhale" repetition and elevated diction ("lacy menace") create register drift during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Beautiful imagery diluted by scaffold: "bleeding starlight" recurs 4× without deepening, and verbatim "shared exhale" repetition in climax creates text loop that dulls immediacy without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via specific sensory details (cobalt grotto, ember-fissured orb), but disenchanted ruler arc follows predictable emotional beats without fresh moral calculus or risk-taking.</comment>
