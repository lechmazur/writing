<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation (refusal of council demand) but lacks contradictory impulses during pivotal moments; final choice earned yet micro-choices lack layered irrationality under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with visible cost (toxic sky’s sting during passage, plate’s prior dullness), but council confrontation setup lacks payoff, capping high-band eligibility per gate rules.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zinc plate functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (avoiding lies to sustain glow) and charges final image (luminous green beside map), satisfying 9+ gate for environment shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early via plate’s wilting, but council pressure dissipates after refusal; escalation through map assembly narrows options yet lacks coherent antagonist pressure required for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through actions (rereading fragments, truthful whisper) with resonant final image; avoids moralizing though "candor can bloom" risks sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("vines sang softly," "ink shimmered like sunrise on metal") with rhythmic control, though "bioluminescent ferns" creates minor register drift in lyrical voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; "whispered a simple truth" weakens pressure in peak beat via passive verb, costing 0.1 from 8.8 ceiling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of truth-restores-world trope through bottled conversations and zinc plate mechanics; council conflict underutilization prevents risk distinction bonus.</comment>
