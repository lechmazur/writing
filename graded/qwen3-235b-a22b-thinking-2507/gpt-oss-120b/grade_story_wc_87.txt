<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("buoyed by hope yet weighed down") and embodied emotion shine, but "doubts melt into vapor" risks unearned resolution; final choice earned by micro-choices like using utility poles as beacons.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise under Accumulative/Textural lens—the steady ember reweights regrets with conceptual cost—but reflection on crew abandonment slightly overextends BRR limits without altering present tactics beyond initial course-setting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Utility poles and compass constrain choices (navigating without stars) and charge the final image, with sensory details like "liquid glass" water evolving to mirror internal shift; micro-setting fully qualifies per 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("backlash of regrets" as tidal wave) without visceral testing—no moment where regret physically impedes paddling; deepening occurs but cost lacks concrete pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through compass/utility poles as non-literal answer to "align heart and action," avoiding moralizing; "regrets as lessons rather than shackles" earns resonance without stated moral per 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("trembling gold," "merrily melancholic breeze") reflects navigator’s state, but "flickering faith" repetition risks tic-like convergence under stress; rhythmic control otherwise exemplary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Template cadence ("He lifted... He set... He felt...") triggers -0.4 penalty; otherwise high density with "liquid glass" specificity, though "doubts melt into vapor" slightly overwrites emotional shift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Transforms "redemption voyage" trope through utility-pole navigation and astronomical compass specificity, but emotional arc leans familiar; "merrily melancholic" synthesizes fresh inflection without gimmickry.</comment>
