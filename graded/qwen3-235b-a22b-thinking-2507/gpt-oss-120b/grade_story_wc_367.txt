<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority leans poetic over embodied; "weight of centuries" lacks specific contradiction. Mira's vow feels earned but cost remains abstract, missing visceral tradeoffs. Diagnostic labels like "joyous melancholy" trigger minor penalties in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: dissolved newspaper → algae-lit prophecy reconfigures "end of world" with conceptual cost. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density buildup, though cost legibility slightly falters at "shadowed brilliance" realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Emerald lighthouse constrains choices—green stone dictates light color, prism redirects beam—but functions more as atmospheric anchor than tactical constraint. Glass lantern wick charges final image as "newborn sun," meeting 9+ gate via closure linkage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shaping dawn with shadows) tightens through ritual execution, but escalation lacks tangible tradeoffs; Mira's urgency ("act now") isn't pressured by concrete loss. Agency feels ritual-bound rather than choice-driven under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "shadowed elation" reprise, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("paint the morning with hope") reweights shadows positively but lacks counter-readings—complexity feels curated rather than earned through character struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (marine-focused, light-sensitive lexicon) persists under pressure. Filter verbs ("Mira realized") slightly dull immediacy, but rhythmic control ("laughter cracked like distant thunder") and taught lyric compression elevate cohesion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Near-closure template cadence ("Each fragment raced... waves turning silver... constellations rearrange") triggers -0.4 artifact penalty. Otherwise high density; "living serpent of light" avoids purple prose through motif consistency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse mythos with ecological rebirth—newspaper dissolving into algae transforms "end of world" trope. Risk-taking (lyric ritual as climax) heightens stakes but "ancient shadows" concept lacks transformative specificity.</comment>
