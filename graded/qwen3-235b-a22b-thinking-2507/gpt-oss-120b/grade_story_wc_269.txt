<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara's embodied grief ("paling reefs that still whispered their loss") and contradictory impulses (scientific rigor vs. emotional witness) drive the atlas ritual, but "periodically eternal" veers into diagnostic label-speak during coral epiphany without sufficient physical manifestation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully when the console coordinate reappears the missing path, crystallizing the cost: "each missing path could be traced back to a silence in the reef’s chemistry." Orientation anchors in sentence one; Accumulative lens holds through rhythmic data assembly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The steel table—tapped as metronome, bearing atlas fragments—constrains every choice and charges the final image where lights flicker "in rhythm with their taps," transforming tool into oceanic memory conduit without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when the watermark reveals the canyon’s role, shifting from cartographic curiosity to symptom of ecological disorientation. Cost is conceptual (larvae navigation collapse) but legible in log entry; pressure accumulates through rhythmic data assembly under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the atlas tear reweighted as "clue, not loss," avoiding moralizing. Final image of "compass waiting to be recalibrated" offers resonant answer to central question without stating the cost of silenced reef chemistry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mara’s coral witness lens filters details ("bleached branches," "kelp in lazy current"). Rhythmic control peaks in tapping sequences where syntax shortens with rising tide; no head-hopping despite dual characters.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density, but "periodically eternal" repeats as ungrounded abstraction in emotional peaks, slightly muddling the coral epiphany. Final line’s "compass waiting to be recalibrated" achieves crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of coral navigation science with cartographic mystery avoids eco-fiction tropes. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off when rhythmic tapping becomes ritual bridging "past navigation and future restoration" without gimmickry.</comment>
