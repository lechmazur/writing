<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete ("silence tasted on his tongue") but lacks contradictory impulses; motivation is clear yet never tested under pressure, missing the 9+ quick test's earned choice with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant Charged Poise ("invented histories were not lies but bridges") with undeniable conceptual cost ("weight of collected textures settle like pressed petals"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds impeccably from first line to final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting succeeds: the notepad charges closure ("battered notepad collected new textures"), but bonsai labyrinth remains atmospheric backdrop without constraining choices, missing 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collecting time textures) deepens via realization about bridges, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure; cost is felt yet not earned through meaningful tightening of options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "refracted light" and "pressed petals," with final image offering resonant non-literal answer to "what are invented histories?"—zero thematic echo or moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("wind brushed pine needles," "scent of pine resin"); rhythm modulates under pressure with purposeful lyric compression taught early ("trunks twisted like whispered verses").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-loop in "refract/refracted" repetition and scaffold ("he was earnestly studious") slightly dull momentum, but closure beat ("lamp’s ghost would hum") maintains crystalline clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "collector" trope via bonsai/light mechanics; "textures of time" feels fresh and specific, avoiding abstraction while risking quiet closure that pays off through earned coherence.</comment>
