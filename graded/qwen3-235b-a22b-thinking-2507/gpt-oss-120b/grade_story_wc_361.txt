<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lacks interior contradiction; courier's motivation is clear but micro-choices under pressure (e.g., sharing pendant) lack conflicting impulses. Embodied emotion strong ("jittery," heartbeat sync) but no visible struggle between duty and exhaustion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost: courier's physical absence versus lingering "humming light" legacy. Orientation solid by line 3, but shepherd scene lacks felt cost—wonder fades without consequence, weakening escalation stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Aurora-lit ridgeway constrains choices (pendant maps aurora currents) and charges closure (pilgrimage site). Micro-setting triumph: pendant vibration physically syncs with pulse/aurora, making environment inseparable from stakes. Only minor flaw: firepit scene underutilizes spatial pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by courier's agency: each pendant use deepens emotional density (shepherd's transient wonder → girl's map discovery). Cost legible in "glow dimmed, leaving faint echo" after girl departs. Shepherd interaction lacks tangible price, slightly diluting dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "germinate" evolves from metaphor (shepherd's "sunrise-kissed leaves") to literal (tablet's "night flowers"). Final pilgrimage image reweights premise without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—mentor's "world thrives" lesson is dramatized, not declared.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless: courier's "jittery" state reflected in fragmented syntax ("Each time... a soft glow erupted"). Rhythmic control under pressure (aurora tunnel = short, urgent clauses). No head-hopping; voice modulates from nervous to transcendent organically.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ribbons of dancing light" shows textural specificity. Final "humming light" recharges opening shard motif. Hairline slip: "sunrise-kissed leaves" borders cliché but redeemed by context. Propulsion flawless—every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via specificity: pendant's vibration mechanics (pulse sync) constrain choices, avoiding magical convenience. Emotional truth in fleeting "spark of wonder" legacy. Minor deduction: mentor trope slightly familiar despite fresh execution through action.</comment>
