<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority feels authentic through embodied details ("trembling fingers," "luminescent ache"), but emotional progression resolves too neatly from crisis to breakthrough without showing struggle. Diagnostic label "fragmented reality" functions as theme statement rather than earned insight, triggering Q1 penalty for unearned epiphanies during peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with the lighthouse "humming" acknowledgment, crystallizing Elian's transformation. However, the descent into darkness lacks visible cost—his artistic breakthrough requires no tangible sacrifice or trade-off, failing the cost proof test for pinpointing legible consequences at the ending beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse library functions as micro-setting: phosphorescent algae enables the climax's rearranged cards, and the tarot box constrains choices by forcing Elian's redesign method. Final image ("luminescent ache captured in oil") directly charges closure through environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Accumulative density ("walls close in," cards rearranging"), but the "necessary darkness" pressure feels coincidental rather than protagonist-driven—the slamming door isn't motivated by Elian's choices. Cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt, missing band guardrail requirements for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through tarot cards reconfiguring "fragmented reality" as canvas, avoiding moralizing. The final "mosaic of reclaimed pieces" offers resonant non-literal answer to "can broken things glow?" without stating a moral, perfectly fulfilling Q5's 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in stress ("hand brushed broken tarot box, splintered wood seemed to pulse"), but "luminescent ache" repetition becomes a tic during high-pressure beats. Rhythmic control falters when lyrical density blurs immediacy in the descent sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Overwriting in climax: "luminescent ache" appears four times within 150 words, violating density rules. Template cadence ("He lifted... He spread... He arranged") dulls immediacy in redesign sequence, with filter-verb stacks compounding momentum loss in the final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms "broken artist" trope through specific lighthouse-tarot synthesis; the "fragments as canvas" concept feels fresh. Emotional truth in "why not let the flame consume the old self?" avoids cliché, though phoenix card risks derivative resonance.</comment>
