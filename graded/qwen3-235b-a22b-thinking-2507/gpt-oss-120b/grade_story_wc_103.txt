<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interiority lacks embodied conflict; "retrocognitively trapped" stated without showing contradictory impulses affecting choices. No micro-choices under pressure—Mara observes rather than struggles. Strengths include concrete emotion ("texture of time under her fingertips"), but flaws dilute stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (vanished photographs leaving only scent), and accumulative lens holds through density escalation. However, escalation lacks meaningful narrowing of options—photograph dissolution is intentional, not a cost-driven tightening. Orientation clear by paragraph one.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges closure: fading photographs function as micro-setting tools Mara arranges to "echo dissolution," vanishing to leave only scent in the final image. Sensory details (luminescent vines, vaporous threads) are selective and urgency-filtered, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dissolving perception to reveal time's texture) remains abstract; no visceral escalation as photograph dissolution aligns with Mara's goal, not a cost. Two distinct issues: stakes never materialize as concrete pressure, and escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars—fading photographs and hyperbolic geometry—not moralizing. Final image ("reverie that quaked with promise") reweights time's texture without stating a moral. Minor slip: conceptual cost (memory's impermanence) isn't fully dramatized as Mara's personal loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("leaves shifting in proportion to heartbeat") and rhythmic control sustain accumulative pressure. Purposeful compression taught early (retrocognition as sensation) pays off in closure. No dialogue, but voice modulates perfectly from "mutable sanctuary" to quaking reverie.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with clear propulsion ("vaporous threads that stitched the present to the past"). Figurative language ("Möbius strip of foliage") enhances clarity without muddle. Final line ("endless discovery") recharges opening motifs flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hyperbolic geometry and retrocognition transforms time/maze tropes. Risk-taking heightens stakes—non-Euclidean corridors make time tactile—without gimmickry. Closure feels inevitable: "seamless loop where past and future meet" crystallizes the premise.</comment>
