<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation ("transpose life into a new key") remains abstractly stated without contradictory impulses in action; no visible cost to choices despite high stakes, undermining Earned Stasis potential at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure (gull carrying message) achieves Charged Poise under Accumulative lens, but cost remains conceptual rather than felt—no on-page sacrifice or consequence for the writer’s actions weakens final impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse beam’s spiral motion actively guides ink flow, constraining the writer’s method; final image of gull clutching cookie fragment charges the setting with thematic weight, though microdot specs lack physical integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes ("encoding human heartbeats to survive mortality") deepen conceptually, but pressure never escalates—implementation succeeds flawlessly with no meaningful trade-off or narrowed options, violating escalation requirements for high-band conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image ("strangers woke to an inexplicable feeling") delivers Conceptual Repricing by reweighting "open secrets" as lived rewiring, avoiding moralizing while resonating with prior cookie dissolutions and microdot mechanics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("scented oil guiding ink," "lanterned stone") modulates beautifully, but stress degrades unrealistically—voice stays uniformly lyrical during high-stakes encoding without syntactic compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Overwritten cadence ("spycraft microdot film specs, the tiny reels of captured reality") creates synonym loops in peak beats; final paragraph’s stacked modifiers ("inexplicable feeling... subtly rewired") dull closure’s propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of espionage tech with fortune cookies transforms tropes, but lighthouse/secrets imagery leans on familiar archetypes; emotional specificity in "encoding pulse of a human heart" elevates beyond gimmickry.</comment>
