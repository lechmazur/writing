<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kael's motivation ("spark silent revolution") is clear but under-dramatized; interiority stays abstract ("curiosity turned into quiet intrigue") with no contradictory impulses or visible cost in his final action. Trait consistency lacks struggle under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise (fort's "new whispered rhythm") with conceptual cost of revolution's quietness, but no exact on-page sentence shows Kael's personal cost. Orientation is solid by word 10, yet escalation lacks tightening under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The luminous fort actively constrains choices: wall shards become mirrors for the sundial, and phosphorescent moss final image charges closure. Twilight/blackout timeframe pressures decoding tactics, though some description stalls momentum ("glass roses" excess).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silent revolution) lacks escalation; blackout serves as vague atmosphere without live-clock pressure. Sunrise revealing the path feels coincidental, not earned through agency, with no visible price paid for the revolution's success.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "light without flame" imagery and final phosphorescent moss, avoiding moralizing. But the cradle's effect is told ("guards began to question orders") not dramatized, weakening the non-literal answer to revolution's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in light-focused details, but uniform tics under stress ("calmly inventive" repetition) and lyrical density dulls immediacy. Prose modulates well for atmosphere yet converges during key decoding beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Severe template cadence ("his eyes scanning... his curiosity turned") and synonym loops ("calmly inventive precision"/"calmly inventive yet urgent") in high-pressure beats. Filter-verb stacks in closure ("Kael placed... device emitted") dull the revolution's charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh sensory details (phosphorescent pulse, glass roses) transform quiet-revolution tropes, but cradle mechanics feel generic. Bold Accumulative structure falters in execution; specificity avoids quirkiness yet lacks one indispensable fresh inflection.</comment>
