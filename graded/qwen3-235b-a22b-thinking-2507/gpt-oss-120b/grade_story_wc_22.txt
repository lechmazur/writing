<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Coachman’s motivation rooted in ancestral duty shows contradictory impulses (carrying dead languages vs. seeking renewal), but internal conflict lacks visceral struggle during action; micro-choice of timing seed release earns closure though.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with felt cost ("reef’s death was a wound that could never fully heal"), but escalation relies slightly on external triggers (bird calls) rather than pure agency under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Jetty functions as micro-setting constraining choices (positioning for bird calls), charging the final image; however, some ornamental descriptions like "wild orchids" stall momentum without pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sprout emergence reweighting loss as hope, but pressure lacks tangible escalation—cost remains conceptual ("wound that could never heal") without physical tradeoffs during the act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "coral skeletons to lavender shoots," avoiding moralizing; final image ("battlefield could become a field of flowers") resonates with earned ambiguity about irreparable loss and renewal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in linguistic noticing ("bird calls mirrored cadence of dead tongues"), rhythmic control shifts from lyrical to crisp during action; no POV slippage despite poetic compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but "dry husks unfurled like pale scrolls, each whispering a forgotten promise" risks overwritten abstraction in a pivotal beat, slightly muddling immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "gardener of peace" trope through linguistic lens (dead languages → bird calls); "narrow vastness" inflection feels inevitable yet fresh, though premise edges near familiar eco-renewal templates.</comment>
