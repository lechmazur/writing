<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation ("wavelength align with purpose") remains abstract despite vivid interiority; final choice lacks contradictory impulses under pressure—Silas’s enthusiasm never conflicts with doubt during the pivotal coin turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with "doubts still lingered like distant stars" showing cost, but lens (Accumulative/Textural) isn’t solidified until the coin-turning beat, creating mid-scene ambiguity about escalation mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ambered deck and coins function as micro-setting that charges the final image ("glass cracked subtly... creation persisted"), though environmental pressure on choices remains implied rather than actively constraining tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding prophecy for purpose) tightens via the coin-turning act, but escalation relies on cosmic revelation rather than protagonist agency—pressure grows through pattern recognition, not earned adaptation to obstacles.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme ("purpose as frequency") resonates through the coins’ hum and heartbeat alignment, but "rebellion against inevitable darkness" near the end veers into thematic echo, risking moralizing despite strong final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("violet mist," "static bursts coalesced") maintains controlled voice under pressure, though "stellar doubt" repetition in later beats slightly dulls rhythmic precision during the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Whispers of dying light" and "murmurs of ancient metal" form a paraphrase loop in high-pressure beats; elevated diction ("stellar doubt," "resonant reconfiguration") occasionally drifts from Silas’s implied lexicon during tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic collapse and intimate decoding elevates tropes, but "backwards prophecy" feels derivative of time-reversal clichés without sufficient transformation through Silas’s specific methodology or stakes.</comment>
