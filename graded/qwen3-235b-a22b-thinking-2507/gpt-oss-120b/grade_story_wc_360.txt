<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation remains abstract ("mathematics of emotion") without embodied struggle; final realization about disorientation feels unearned as no prior contradictory impulses constrain her choice during the halo's cracking.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Orientation fails early ("trembling dome of topaz workshop" lacks spatial anchors); closure lacks legible cost—the halo's cracking yields rewards (light cascade, collected shards) without sacrificing a path or showing consequence beyond aesthetic transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Topaz workshop actively constrains choices: its pulsing walls enable numerical transposition, and the final "galaxy of murmured feelings" charges closure by transforming setting into living emotional residue, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stakes never materialize as concrete pressure; the halo's approval ("brightened as if approving") removes risk, and the cracking event introduces reward without cost, violating escalation under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "emotion is not a static variable" crystallizes through the printing process, and the final "vanishing stars leave a trace" reweights opening imagery with conceptual cost, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines: ink "shimmered, not merely ink but living fragments" reveals Mara's poetic lens, and rhythmic control modulates perfectly under pressure (e.g., short phrases during the room's shiver).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Lucid turbulence" repeats without evolution (paraphrase loop), and "mathematics of emotion" drifts into abstraction; final "universe’s equation unfold" edges toward thematic echo but avoids outright moralizing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms letterpress mechanics into emotional calculus via specific details (copper impressions encoding "borrowed souls"), though "vanishing stars" leans on overused tropes despite the resonant "trace" payoff.</comment>
