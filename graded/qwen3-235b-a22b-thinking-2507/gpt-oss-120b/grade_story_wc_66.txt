<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear motivation but lacks contradictory impulses; Mara's "thistled calm" remains unchallenged during pivotal transcription, missing interior struggle. Final choice feels inevitable rather than earned through visible micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: dust tracing music lines crystallizes the hunger-for-stories stake with undeniable cost in "quiet pride." Accumulative lens holds throughout with luminous density tightening options, orientation clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Shortwave radio constrains Mara's transcription process (glow enables ink absorption) and charges the final image (dust tracing music). Ember alcove's mist actively shapes tactics as particles hum with stories, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens: luminous density intensifies from radio glow to dust-swirling cadence shift, narrowing Mara's world to transcription. Cost legible in "diligent work had become the bridge" – labor as irreplaceable currency for revival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through dust's transformation from "old parchment" to storyteller, avoiding moralizing. Final line reweights famine with conceptual cost: dust's voice requires teaching, not inherent magic – earned through transcribed glow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("thistled calm," "amber-trapped fireflies") modulates rhythm during pressure. Minor syntactic monotony in climax ("dust swirled... particles tracing... transcription glowed") prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong propulsion but scaffold issues: redundant "calm precision"/"thistled calm" and three consecutive "she" stems in transcription beat. No closure artifacts, but loops prevent higher band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "story famine" via dust-as-medium mechanics, avoiding abstraction. Radio trope slightly familiar, but "luminous dial whispering chords" transforms it with specific sensory logic that heightens stakes.</comment>
