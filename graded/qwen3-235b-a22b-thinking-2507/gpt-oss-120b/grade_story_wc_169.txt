<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arin's interiority shows embodied contradiction ("balancing rigor with whimsy") but lacks micro-choices under pressure; "logical dreamer" trait remains label-driven despite lucid observations. Final declaration lacks visible cost escalation from prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (hope made tangible), but the gauge's "singing" resolution feels unearned—pressure escalates through accumulating patterns without narrowing Arin's options. Lens ambiguity past midpoint (-0.3).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tide-polished grotto functions as micro-setting: water echoes constrain timeline perception, sea-foam draping actively shapes balloon light refraction that charges the final ledger image. Sensory specificity (kelp ribbons, pearl-white spheres) avoids white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revitalizing faith via equations) tightens through balloon releases, but pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation—Arin observes patterns rather than adapting tactics. Cost remains conceptual (communal hope) without visceral forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through decorated equations, but "mathematics of hope were etched into the world itself" triggers thematic echo penalty (-0.6) in final paragraph. Serene upheaval motif charges closure yet moralizing undercuts ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lucidly watchful" filtering sea-foam physics) sustains under pressure. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" jargon, but rhythmic control in balloon-release sequences (e.g., "kaleidoscope of potential") teaches pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Figurative density blurs cause/effect in climax ("needle dancing to cadence of decorative patterns"); "serene upheaval" synonym loops in final beats trigger -0.4 artifact penalty. Opening line’s stacked modifiers reduce propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mathematical artistry with communal hope, but "logical dreamer" trope lacks transformation. Tide-scholar framework feels derivative despite specific kelp-balloon execution; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
