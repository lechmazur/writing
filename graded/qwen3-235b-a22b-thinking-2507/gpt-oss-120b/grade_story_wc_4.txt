<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority rich but lacks contradictory impulses; "transmute pain" epiphany risks over-articulation without sufficient struggle. Micro-choices under pressure (e.g., delaying opening case) show hierarchy of values, yet flaws feel curated rather than inevitable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (tears/smiles), but lens ambiguity persists—Accumulative/Textural pressure isn’t fully taught until midpoint. Cost proof ("tears fell like dew") is legible, yet Earned Stasis hinges on convenient village arrival rather than Mara’s causal choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lavender field and map case constrain choices (e.g., perfume settling thoughts) and charge the final image (case reflecting amber light). Sensory hierarchy is purposeful: "purple perfume" calms Mara while "rusting girders" mirror decay, avoiding overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</comment><comment>Stakes deepen via photograph arrangement, but pressure lacks agency-driven escalation—villagers arrive coincidentally. "Tears fell like dew" provides cost, yet the dominant stake (collective healing) resolves without meaningful trade-off; Mara’s promise to "linger" feels unearned by prior struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through arcs and feather, but "hope finds its way through every crack" in final dialogue triggers Thematic Echo penalty (-0.6). Avoids sentimentality via "tears/smiles" duality, yet the ending’s "endless tapestry" risks tidy moralizing, diluting complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("mist swirled like whispered secrets"), with rhythm modulating under pressure (shorter sentences during photo arrangement). Dialogue with child is natural, but "transmute pain" line slightly disrupts Mara’s otherwise consistent lyrical lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; "vines climb" repetition is pattern-taught. Minor overwriting in "pulsed with the collective heartbeat of the village" risks purple prose, but density remains high. Final line’s "timeless canvas" elegantly recharges lavender/rust motifs without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "healing ritual" trope via photograph arcs and feather token. Specificity anchors universals (e.g., "dove gray map case" as emotional cartography), though "earnest whimsy" tone occasionally leans archetypal. Risk-taking in accumulative structure elevates without gimmickry.</comment>
