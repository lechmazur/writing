<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira’s “molted personalities” concept lacks embodied contradiction; shedding personas reads as label (“calm of a monk and fire of a child”) not visceral struggle. Rook’s quiet strength remains undifferentiated in voice during pivotal tin discovery, missing status dynamics. Micro-choices under pressure absent—planting seeds requires no tradeoff.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Closure fails Cost Proof Test: no on-page sacrifice for the “luminous fracture” glow-up. Resistance blooms effortlessly (seeds sprout, travelers arrive) without narrowing options or felt cost. Orientation Test violated—“as the moon clears the skyline” repeats without temporal stakes, leaving “when” ambiguous past 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>“Rusted library under stars” anchors early with sensory specificity (“whispered applause” of light through panes), but micro-setting doesn’t constrain choices. Seed packets planted in floor cracks face no obstacles, missing 9+ gate requirement that environment charge the final image with cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Zero escalation: “blooming resistance” faces no opposition (guards slip tins willingly), stakes remain abstract. No narrowing of options—rebuilding happens frictionlessly. Cost is purely thematic (“forge beauty”) with no visible price paid, violating Band Guardrail for 8.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme (“beauty from anarchy”) stated outright in Lira’s final whisper, triggering Thematic Echo penalty. Wildflowers symbolize hope but never face threat, making resonance feel unearned. No non-literal answer to central question—the garden’s song is declared, not revealed through action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>POV slips during tin discovery (“Rook recognized the tin’s weight”) blur focalization. Prose texture shines in atmospheric beats (“moon’s silver glaze turning rusted iron into veins of light”) but collapses under pressure with abstract phrasing (“pulse waiting to break”) instead of concrete action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Figurative overload dilutes tension: “shelves into an altar,” “mosaic of green light,” “voice a trembling candle” in high-pressure scenes. Template cadence runs (“Lira... Rook...”) across discovery beat. Filter-verb stacks (“Lira, now wearing...”) dull immediacy where momentum matters most.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>“Molting personalities” premise feels fresh but isn’t transformed through lived detail—no specific tradeoffs shown. Tropes (coffee tin secrets, prison rebellion) remain generic; “luminous fracture” echoes famous lines without reconfiguration. Risk-taking is superficial, avoiding bold choices that heighten stakes.</comment>
