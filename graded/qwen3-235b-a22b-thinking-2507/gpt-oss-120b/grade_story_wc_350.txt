<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lacks interior contradiction; "empathetically decisive" feels labeled not lived. No visible struggle when dropping the weight despite city's scars. Micro-choices absent during pivotal moments like the chime release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost—bridges succeed without setbacks. Orientation strong (tower anchored by 42 words), but cost proof test fails: no on-page sentence showing paid price for unity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clock tower functions as micro-setting: weight retrieval constrains tactics, bridges charge final image. Dew-glittering planks reweight silos from husks to hope. Meets 9+ gate by charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("heal scars") never tested—grain elevators comply instantly. No escalation: planks laid without resistance. Agency lacks pressure; cost remains abstract despite "scars" declaration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing but "bridges of hope" leans abstract. Final image reweights silos into singing pathways, yet "empathy" stated outright weakens earned resonance. No thematic echo penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct sonic perceptual signature ("grain elevator talks," "humming centuries"). Rhythm modulates from humming dawn to vigorous conducting. "Empathetically decisive" label briefly jars but voice recovers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("borrowed starlight" repeats without evolution). Overwritten phrases like "soft sunrise captured in amber" dilute momentum. Final line’s "breathed as one" compensates with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Transforms librarian trope via sonic specificity (Mandarin lullabies in chimes). "Vigorously tender" paradox feels fresh, but premise (healing through art) lacks risk. No derivative premise penalty.</comment>
