<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses (weary negotiator vs. hopeful ritualist) drive micro-choices like placing the clipboard, but "operatively gentle" recurs as diagnostic label-speak, undermining embodied emotion during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (the "quiet ache" of redemption’s price crystallized in sword-laying), but celestial dance motif repeats without intensifying pressure, weakening escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Terrace marble constrains choice (sword placement), yet celestial bodies function decoratively rather than as micro-setting; "flawed beauty" tone charges the final hymn but lacks earlier specificity to reach 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redemption’s price) tightens through density increase (firelight to dawn), but chieftains’ resolution feels passive—Lira’s agency drives the turn, yet the cost ("letting go of grudges") remains abstractly stated, not viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action (swords as symbols, clipboard’s evolution), avoiding moralizing; final image ("broken and whole" terrace) reweights "redemption" with conceptual cost without stating a moral, satisfying Q5 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("flickers of firelight," "armor clanged like storm") shines, but "operatively gentle" repetition violates voice consistency, creating uniform tics that flatten texture during high-stakes moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control until "operatively gentle" repeats like template cadence (3x), triggering paraphrase-loop penalty; final paragraph avoids overwriting, but midsection scaffold dulls momentum during ritual climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms peace-treaty trope via ritual lens (clipboard as burden→hope), yet celestial dance feels derivative; "flawed beauty" synthesis is fresh but risks sentimentality without the hymn’s grit, narrowly missing risk distinction.</comment>
