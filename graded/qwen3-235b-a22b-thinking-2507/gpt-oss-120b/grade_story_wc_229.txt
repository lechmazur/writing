<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion ("tears glistening like dew") but "screaming tenderness" triggers diagnostic label penalty; micro-choices under pressure lack contradictory impulses during pivotal cork-sealing moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lacks visible cost—fisherman’s arrival resolves conflict via coincidence rather than Mara’s agency; "proof arrived on the wind" summary violates Q2 cost proof test despite strong Accumulative lens setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cobalt lighthouse and vial cork function as micro-setting, constraining choices (cork placement) and charging final image ("cracked surface catching first light"); sensory details like jasmine scent are vivid but over-rely on visual/tactile at expense of urgency-driven narrowing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving whispers travel farther) remains abstract; fisherman’s compass deviation feels coincidental rather than earned escalation, violating "coincidence may complicate but not resolve" rule for Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through garden scent and cork, but final paragraph’s explicit "proof that whispers truly travel farther than shouts" constitutes moralizing, triggering Q5’s −0.7 penalty for thematic echo in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("vapor curled... trembling in rhythm with her heart") reflects Mara’s state; rhythmic control under pressure strong though "screaming tenderness" slightly disrupts voice consistency in climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Minor synonym loops ("softest whisper"/"gentle vibration") and elevated diction ("screaming tenderness") in high-pressure beats trigger −0.4; otherwise high density with resonant final image ("beam slicing the brightening horizon").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse keeper + vibrational intent avoids tropes, but emotional specificity lacks bold risk; "screaming tenderness" borders on generic, limiting transformative potential despite strong atmospheric originality.</comment>
