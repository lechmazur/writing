<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; keeper’s passive witness role avoids meaningful choice under pressure. Motivation ("to witness without judgment") remains abstract, never tested by concrete stakes. No visible cost in final endurance weakens Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure (Conceptual Repricing: "silence births renewal") lacks visible cost; "centuries of weight" erased feels unearned. Accumulative/Textural lens holds but final image’s fragility ("crumbling peace") isn’t charged by prior causality. Orientation clear by 100 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Overgrown library functions as micro-setting: moss-thickened walls and damp parchment scent constrain keeper’s descent, charging the final image where "vines retract slightly." Sensory specificity (river’s "cold fingers," phosphorescent thread) avoids white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seeking regenerative silence) remains abstract; pressure accumulates texturally but lacks narrowing of options. Keeper’s entrance into refuge resolves without tangible cost—centuries erased feels like convenience, not earned trade-off under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</comment>Theme ("silence births renewal") emerges through concrete particulars (dissolving thoughts, ink-in-water imagery), avoiding moralizing. Final line’s thematic echo ("silence births renewal") slightly undermines earned resonance but gains weight via "crumbling peace" fragility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("memory slips like water," silence "humming against cracks of mind") modulates with pressure. Non-standard syntax ("burrow toward the water using a method older than the stones") taught early and paid off in origami’s cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats ("silence grew louder, regenerative and warm") slightly dulls immediacy. No loops or scaffold; sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short phrases during descent: "He burrowed deeper"). Final line’s "promise kept" avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library-as-living-organism with silence-as-physical-force feels inevitable. "Obsidian refuge" avoids trope through specific mechanics (feeding on silence, river’s veil), though emotional risk-taking stays restrained within lyrical mode.</comment>
