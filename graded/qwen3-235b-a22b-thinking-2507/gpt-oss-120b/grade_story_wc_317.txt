<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation ("safeguard space for innovation") remains abstract without embodied conflict; no visible struggle or contradictory impulses during design phase. Final triumph lacks felt cost—Mara’s quiet victory feels unearned as the seed obliges effortlessly, missing the "genuine struggle" requirement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the bloom’s "fragrance that seemed to rewrite the night" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost. Orientation passes—nocturnal setting anchors by line 3—and Accumulative lens holds through atmospheric density buildup to the eruption.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setting functions decoratively; the brook’s "rhythm that mirrored the ticking" subtly pressures time but fails to constrain choices. The corpse flower seed—a micro-setting object—charges the final image powerfully, narrowly clearing the 9+ gate for Q3 despite static backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("safeguard space for innovation") stays abstract with no tangible cost or opposition. Participants solve puzzles smoothly, the seed blooms obligingly—missing the "credible loss" requirement. Escalation via cipher-solving lacks meaningful trade-offs, failing to narrow options under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "possibilities whisper and grow" gains weight through the seed’s journey, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights the storm-born silence as fertile, not threatening—a strong Conceptual Repricing. Lacks deeper integration with Mara’s specific history to reach 9.0.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("windows breathing light," "thrum of potential") reflects Mara’s puzzle-focused mind. Voice modulates effectively under pressure—lyrical calm shifts to awe at the bloom. Avoids "diagnostic label-speak" but "soft thrum of potential" edges toward abstraction in high-stakes moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop: brook "sang a low melody" then "rhythm mirrored ticking" restates atmosphere. "Orthogonal approaches" creates slight register drift. Otherwise, rhythm varies purposefully ("petals unfurled like a map of constellations"), and closure image avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of escape rooms and corpse flowers avoids tropes, but "innovation" motivation lacks specificity. Emotional truth in Mara’s quiet triumph is undercut by insufficient struggle. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies—profession feels underutilized rather than transformed through lived detail.</comment>
