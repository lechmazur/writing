<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete ("foxglove regret," "violet sorrow") but lacks contradictory impulses; motivation is clear yet static. Final endurance earns closure but micro-choices under pressure remain undifferentiated (e.g., arranging chime as constellations lacks tactical tradeoffs).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visible cost: regret softens but returns, signaling loss as cyclical. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density intensifies through ritual repetition and the traveler’s arrival, reweighting stakes via the glass orchid’s tangible resonance without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Opal library constrains every choice (light through panes, cloud-swirled parchment), with the cracked bamboo tube charging the final image. Sensory details ("pale light seeped through opal panes," "scent of forgotten rain") are purpose-driven and evolve with emotional urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving names against oblivion) tightens via the traveler’s arrival, narrowing options to gifting the orchid. Cost is felt in the caretaker’s softened regret—loss persists but purpose crystallizes. Agency is renunciation-focused, though escalation lacks visceral pressure spikes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory’s fragility and resilience via glass orchids and cracked chimes. Ending reweights the premise—"loss was part of the cycle"—through the traveler’s dew-weighted names, avoiding moralizing. No thematic echo, but complexity slightly diluted by idealized resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("opal panes," "violet sorrow") and rhythmic control elevate pressure. Lyric compression taught early pays off in closure’s "hope-brushed horizon." Zero head-hopping; voice modulates perfectly from systematic to transcendent without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "refracting into a soft chorus of luminescence" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Figurative language ("foxglove regret") avoids muddle by tying to embodied sensation. Minor overwriting risk in "deserted marvels" offset by payoff in closure’s resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via specific logic: extinct feelings catalogued as vellum, names preserved in crystal vials. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes coherently. Freshness anchored in glass-orchid physics and "systematic devotion," though emotional arc leans idealized.</comment>
