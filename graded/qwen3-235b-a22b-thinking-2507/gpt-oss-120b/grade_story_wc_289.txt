<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction under pressure absent; Mira's "keeper of secrets" role lacks embodied trade-offs. Epiphany ("role she could fulfill") feels unearned without micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values. Strength: concrete notebook detail ("humming with unfinished vows") anchors motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost: thread glow as "reminder that every secret is a strand." But escalation lacks protagonist agency—Mira passive as petal "detached without warning," breeze "stirred" lily pads. Accumulative lens holds, yet coincidence drives resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting (petal, notebook) charges closure: warm petal triggers silver-light cascade. But lily pond/temple functions as backdrop, not constraint—Mira's choices unaffected by environment. Sensory density strong ("prismatic quiet," pine/rain perfume) yet physical space doesn't narrow options.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding connecting thread) remains abstract; no visible price paid. Mira's "content" resolution lacks cost—thread glow is metaphorical, not tactical. Pressure grows through external magic (twigs hum, pond erupts) not her choices. Stakes declared but never viscerally tested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: petal's "lingering sigh," mosaic tiles as "secret homes." Final image ("prismatic quiet lingering") reweights opening without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality, but "keeper of secrets" concept lacks complexity—no counter-readings or genuine struggle with the role.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "notebook humming with unfinished vows," "prismatic yet quiet." Rhythm modulates effectively—short beats ("She stepped onto the spiral.") amid lush prose. Under stress (petal fall), diction stays elevated without compression, slightly straining plausibility ("ghostwriter’s lingering sigh").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Opening ("pale sunrise hovering on calm water") and closing ("harmonious chorus of prismatic quiet") recharge motif. But high-pressure beats risk muddle: "cascade of silver light" tracing "invisible thread" strains physical logic. Figurative density high ("sequined ribbons," "hush of centuries") yet closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis in "thrush’s nest twig spiral" as conduit for unsent letters. Emotional truth in ghostwriter’s role, but "invisible thread" concept leans abstract. Safety-middle in stakes—could swap "lotus temple" for generic shrine with minor edits. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure works, yet lacks gritty specificity.</comment>
