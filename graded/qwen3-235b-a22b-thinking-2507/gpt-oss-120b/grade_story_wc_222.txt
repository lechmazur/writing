<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied ("heart beating with sighing wind") but lacks contradictory impulses in climax; "sacredly playful" trait remains label-only without tradeoffs during pivotal swaps.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with spire's physical transformation, but "centuries-old betrayal" backstory fragment weakens causal chain; violet sky pressure accumulates effectively under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pocket sundial lid functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (pre-sunrise swaps) and charges final image; "frost softened with each secret" demonstrates environment altering tactics organically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("amend betrayal") remains abstract despite time pressure; no narrowing of options or personal cost escalation—Lysander executes flawless plan without meaningful resistance or tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through chess-swap ritual rather than statement; final image (children spinning sundial) resonates as non-literal answer to "embracing unknown," avoiding moralizing despite near-miss with "playful spirits/daring hearts" phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("read wind and stone as open books") with rhythmic control; minor overwriting ("frozen teeth clawing heavens") avoids disrupting pressure during high-stakes swaps.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong propulsion but "glittering monolith" opener veers into cliché; no fatal loops though "sacredly playful" repetition slightly dilutes peak-beat density during final queen swap.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of thief archetype through "apprentice of wonder" lens, but ice spire with violet auroras leans on derivative fantasy tropes without sufficient transformation of emotional stakes.</comment>
