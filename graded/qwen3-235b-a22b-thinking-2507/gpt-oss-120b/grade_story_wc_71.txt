<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction underdeveloped; narrator’s shift from observer to catalyst lacks visible competing impulses in pressured moments. Elderly woman’s cameo validates but doesn’t challenge the narrator’s stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: final image reweights "hush" with conceptual cost ("silence as vivid as color"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density shifts, though one tightening beat (shard placement) barely clears escalation threshold.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bay setting constrains choices (dawn timing affects light/perception) and charges closure. "Displaced objects" motif actively shapes tactics—wilted flower becomes hush conduit—elevating micro-setting beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Accumulative pressure, but cost legibility falters: narrator’s catalytic role shift lacks visible forfeiture. "Sanctify" action redefines options yet avoids showing what’s sacrificed for this new stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (cracked teacup), avoiding moralizing. Final line’s "hush that lives within them" offers resonant CR, though "creeping normality" concept risks abstraction without sufficient character-specific struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("air tasting of brine and promise") persists under pressure. Rhythmic control excels—lyric cadence modulates with hush’s spread—but "inadvertently profound" label slightly drifts from narrator’s lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops in closure beat, but "hushed blaze" repetition (opening/closing) creates paraphrase scaffold. Overwritten phrases ("amber halos stretching like lazy thoughts") slightly blur immediacy during shard discovery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence-as-substance feels inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes, though "perfumer’s shard" trope risks derivativeness without the displaced-objects innovation.</comment>
