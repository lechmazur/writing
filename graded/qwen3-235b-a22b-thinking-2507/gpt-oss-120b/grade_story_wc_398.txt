<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels ("destined mismatch," "intersubjective understanding") triggering diagnostic-speak penalties; embodied contradiction is thin despite credible endurance. Final smile earns stasis but motivation lacks character-particular texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with Charged Poise closure as letter dissolves into "dark root," cost legible in heat transfer to skin. Orientation debt (-0.4) from vague anchors past 120 words caps score despite strong final image reweighting stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vineyard terroir functions as micro-setting: vines' physical response to ash constrains the sentinel's action and charges closure. "Amber" recurrence risks cliché but gains specificity through tactile soil/memory interplay in final dissolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via textural escalation as vines' "mismatched embraces" narrow options toward dissolution. Cost (letter's physical loss) is felt but not visibly traded; pressure accumulates beautifully though agency lacks tangible friction beyond whispered persuasion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through charred letter/vine parallels without moralizing. Final image reweights "mismatches" as nourishment, but "passionate subtlety" phrasing in closure slightly overstates the earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice has distinct perceptual signature (grape-scented coat, ember-memory) but suffers from repetitive "gently persuasive" tics. Focalization stays consistent though dialogue absence limits texture; rhythm falters in over-patterned "by drawing parallels" repetitions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Severe template cadence: "by drawing parallels" repeats 4× consecutively in climax with identical structure. "Amber" overuse (7×) and synonym churn ("patient cool"/"stubborn mismatches") dull closure momentum despite lyrical highs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vineyard labor and emotional archaeology avoids trope pitfalls. Risk in Accumulative structure pays off, but "destined mismatches" concept leans generic without sufficient grounding in the sentinel's specific flaws or history.</comment>
