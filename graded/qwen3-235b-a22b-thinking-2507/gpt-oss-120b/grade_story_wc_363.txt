<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "latent sacrifice" is diagnostic label without embodied cost in peak beats. Motivation clear but acceptance feels passive, missing micro-choices that would dramatize the sacrifice trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis with visible cost ("amber bead now dimmed, its glow spent"), but puzzle-box discovery relies on coincidence that complicates without character-driven escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orchard functions as micro-setting: plum blossoms and bamboo constrain movement and charge the final image ("orchard glowed faintly with the memory of the amber bead"), avoiding symbolic clichés through tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mending silence) tightens via Mara's realization of sacrifice, but cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized in the action; escalation lacks meaningful character-driven pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through amber bead's transformation from "captured sunrise" to "beacon," avoiding moralizing while the final image reweights sacrifice as "the loom of tomorrow" with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct textile perceptual signature ("breath of ancient loom," "warp thread") modulates rhythm, but repetitive "stoically sparkling" creates scaffold loops that dilute pressure during the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Stoically sparkling" repetition forms paraphrase loops in high-pressure beats (climax), muddling immediacy; otherwise strong density and rhythm, though final line's ornamental reuse triggers artifact penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weaving metaphors with silence as "unweaving" feels inevitable, but "amber bead as captured sunrise" lacks specificity; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
