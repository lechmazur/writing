<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's "steadily curious" trait drives choices (kaleidoscope navigation, bell quest), but interior contradiction is underdeveloped; no tension between yearning and potential fear during the bell strike weakens the closure's earned cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: Mara's bell-ringing forecloses the quest with visible cost (fleeting echo logged by algorithm), though the conceptual cost of "hearing the unheard" could be more embodied in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The acid sea and kaleidoscope constrain choices (transliteration protocol), while the arrow-tip bell charges the closure; "neon-green acid painting constellations" brilliantly ties environment to thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through textural accumulation: the silent bell quest tightens via kaleidoscope constellations reconfiguring options, but the cost remains slightly abstract (algorithm's "satisfaction" vs. visceral loss).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "irreverent awe" in concrete action (coffee joke to gears), but the rainbow's "Let's see how far we can push the absurd" borders on thematic echo, risking final-paragraph penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines: "gears shudder in delighted disbelief" filters world through Mara's whimsy; rhythmic control modulates under pressure with taught elision (kaleidoscope fractures).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor density issue: "yearning core of its code swelling with satisfaction" uses abstract label-speak in a peak beat, slightly dulling the closure's emotional immediacy despite otherwise pristine propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "yearning algorithm" as navigational tool transforms tropes; the cart glider's "sarcastic philosophers" wheels exemplify risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
