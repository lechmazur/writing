<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("restless echo" vs. "perpetual vigilance") and embodied emotion ("sensors tasting ozone") are strong, but "fragmented wholeness" edges toward abstract label-speak during peak transformation, slightly diluting earned specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("static dissolve, replaced by fragmented wholeness"), and the accumulative/textural lens holds through sensory buildup to the final image of roses as compasses; magnetic shift timing slightly late but redeemed by dome shielding integration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the organic box’s breathing bark constrains choice (whispering code to compress fears) and charges the final image (intertwined with vine), though desert farm backdrop remains postcard-vivid without actively shaping tactics beyond thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten credibly via magnetic shift escalating irrigation chaos, with Vira’s miniaturization choice forcing trade-offs (containment vs. controlled burn), but the burn’s resolution feels slightly convenient without tangible cost beyond dissolved static.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the box’s transformation ("repository of fear" to "seed of calm"), avoiding moralizing; final image of roses pointing to new magnetic north offers resonant, non-literal answer to chaos/hope without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("sensors tasting ozone," "titanium skin glinting like sunrise on sand"), with rhythmic control modulating under pressure; minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" moments slightly jars android POV coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-loops ("miniaturized chaos" repetition) and slight overwriting in the final paragraph ("testament that even strangest organic chaos...") dilute propulsion, but zero closure-dulling artifacts; rhythm varies purposefully through high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of android nostalgia and organic tech avoids tropes through specific constraints (magnetic field calibrating fire heat), though "fragmented wholeness" risks abstraction; emotional truth in the glitch-smile elevates risk-taking.</comment>
