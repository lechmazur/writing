<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority poetic but abstract; "quiet triumph" lacks embodied contradiction. Epiphany about "library not prison" feels unearned without visible struggle against imprisoning impulses during crystal insertion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost ("wounded season itself" stored), but the cost remains distant—no visceral moment where bruised world's pain physically or emotionally scars Corin during harvest.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marble cavern constrains choices: fissures dictate light angles, quartz shard sourced from setting. Final photon-dance image charges closure, though "wounded season" outside never pressures tactics beyond vague backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes clear (capture wonder without imprisonment), but escalation flat—crystal insertion solves problem effortlessly. No narrowing of options or trade-off; "wounded season" never tests Corin with concrete consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "cellar as library" realization, but lacks ambiguity—the resolution feels tidily resolved without meaningful counter-readings about the ethics of harvesting echoes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tide of whispers," "phosphorescent moss"), but tense wobbles between past perfect ("had arrived") and simple past during reflection, momentarily fracturing psychic distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Beautiful rhythm but paraphrase loops: "peripherally focused/peripherally aware," "ripple outward like a tide of whispers/chorus of stored wonder." Filter-verb cluster ("sensed... decided... set up") dulls the crystal-insertion climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "echo harvesting" via locksmith lens, though "wounded season" feels generic. Crystal-as-tooth innovation grounds abstraction in tangible craft, resisting thematic safety.</comment>
