<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Chaplain’s interiority shows contradictory impulses (doctrine vs. doubt) through embodied choices like tracing filigree "as if reading a prayer," earning his Earned Stasis. But backstory on confessions remains ornamental, failing BRR by not altering present tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (apology now "pulsed through metal"), but "by the way light breaks" phrase acts as unearned coincidence twice, violating Accumulative lens by resolving pressure without causal buildup. Non-closure accumulation cap (-0.8) applies for two distinct issues.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting (dust-caked gears, cracked window) constrains choices—slow rod insertion alters tactics—and charges final image with sunlight on pistons. Avoids white-room syndrome by weaving brass filigree into embodied prayer. Capped at 8.8 due to Q7 closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through density increase (gears as "memory of a life") as chaplain exposes mechanisms, narrowing options to "fresh spring" choice. Cost legible when apology transforms into action, but light coincidence complicates rather than escalates under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through clockwork heart’s evolution from symbol to living pulse, avoiding moralizing until final paragraph’s "second opinions could breathe new life" commits Thematic Echo (-0.6). Resonant final image ("metronome guiding him") nearly salvages it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice distinct via chaplain’s tactile perception ("fingers tracing filigree"), but "vibrant hush" repetition creates uniform rhythm under stress. Prose modulates effectively from foggy arrival to sunlit climax, though filter verbs dilute immediacy in high-pressure gear insertion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Vibrant hush" scaffold loop appears in climax ("shop seemed to hold its breath again, vibrant and hushed"), dulling closure image. Template cadence ("By the way light breaks") triggers -1.7 penalty as artifact touches final beat, disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of redemption mechanics via clockwork heart—tropes transformed by specific repair shop details (dust-caked gears as "memory"). Emotional truth in chaplain’s quiet triumph avoids sentimentality, but "light breaks" cliché slightly undermines risk.</comment>
