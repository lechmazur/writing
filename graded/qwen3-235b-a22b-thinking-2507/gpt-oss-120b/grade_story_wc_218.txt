<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to foster interspecies respect is concrete through copper-wire rituals and botanical diary entries, but her "brazen calm" lacks contradictory impulses during pivotal moments like the council confrontation; interiority remains consistent yet under-stressed when facing her deadline.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully when the council lifts the time-limit decree, with visible cost in Mara's transferred vitality; Accumulative/Textural lens holds as copper-resonance density reweights stakes, though the council's sudden policy shift risks convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The temple orchard's living stone pillars constrain choices by requiring copper-wire conduction methods, and the copper veins directly charge the final image of the island breathing as one organism; sensory details like "chlorophyll clouds" are purposefully selective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via copper-resonance deepens the dominant stake (time limit vs. interspecies harmony), narrowing options as the deadline approaches; cost is unmistakable in Mara's vitality transfer, though the council's reversal feels slightly unearned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through the copper-wire symposium reconfiguring "architectural secrets" into embodied connection; the final image of wire-to-wood binding offers non-literal resolution without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite Mara's explanatory whisper.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in botanical observations ("marginal calculations of growth cycles"), but tense shifts ("She began at dawn... the wire humming") briefly disrupt psychic distance during high-pressure installation scenes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold with high density ("chlorophyll clouds from entwined roots"), though "bruised amber" sun and "petrified trees" risk mixed metaphors; final line's rhythmic control elevates closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms ecological tropes through copper-conduction mechanics and "living stone" specificity; the wire-to-wood synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in architectural bio-energetics heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
