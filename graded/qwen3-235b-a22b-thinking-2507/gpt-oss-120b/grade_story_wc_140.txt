<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction lacks concrete micro-choices under pressure; the "rough like corrugated metal, smooth like polished glass" texture metaphor embodies motivation but no visible struggle between impulses alters tactics despite high stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully with conceptual cost: "a purpose that no death certificate could erase" crystallizes the void-to-archivist shift, charged by the tide’s rhythm and label’s glow at the final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Shipping containers remain atmospheric backdrop; they sway with tides but never constrain movement or choices (e.g., no blocked path forcing detour), missing the 9+ gate requirement for environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through the label’s peeling numbers and tide-triggered projections, but pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation—the sea’s rhythm drives change, not character agency against rising opposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically: "stitching the world back together" reweights memory’s texture as resistance, avoiding moralizing while the ghostly murals charge the final image with erased histories’ conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines: "filter reality differently" manifests in sepia-hued port descriptions, with rhythmic control tightening as the label peels, no head-hopping despite layered voices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "each piece a layer... each snippet layered" creates synonym loop; otherwise, propulsion is masterful with "cold filament that tingled" offering textural specificity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Fresh synthesis of "erased histories" via poison-label mechanics feels inevitable; risk-taking in Accumulative design heightens stakes, though the port setting risks derivative familiarity without deeper transformation.</comment>
