<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in embodied action (caching fragments, sensing rain smell) reveals contradictory impulses—methodical secrecy versus desire for visibility—culminating in earned endurance as conduit. Final choice charged by cost of lifelong invisibility now surrendered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stakes when commuters sense Maren’s presence; cost legible in "lifelong invisibility surrendered" via sapphire-hush glow. Hybrid lens (Accumulative building to Situational stance) holds, though pipe-chase discovery lacks causal urgency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rusted tape reel fragment constrains choices (fitting spindle completes circuit) and charges the final image—commuters sensing "gentle invitation" via sapphire-hush glow. Sensory hierarchy (dust/ink/rain smell) filters through archivist’s grief without symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (becoming visible through grief’s acknowledgment) tightens via tape’s activation, narrowing options to conduit-or-invisibility. Agency-driven escalation falters slightly—the reel’s discovery feels coincidental, not earned by prior pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "visibility was not merely being seen" crystallizes via commuters pausing at threshold. Avoids moralizing by embedding insight in sensory payoff (sapphire hush "seeping into bones"), though "quiet grief" borders on abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in archivist-specific noticing ("ferromagnetic resonance," "copper conduits"). Rhythmic control under pressure ("soft thud that blended with rustle of pages") modulates with outage urgency. No head-hopping; lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Sapphire hush" repeats 4× with diminishing returns, triggering paraphrase-loop penalty (-0.3). Otherwise pristine propulsion: "pulsed faintly when brushed" merges action/image. Final line’s "lingering shadows" avoids cliché through concrete antecedent ("flickering streetlights").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms "urban explorer" trope via methodical grief-caching premise. Fresh inflection: visibility earned not through self-assertion but translating "silent pleas" into light. Avoids safety-middle by making commuters’ acknowledgment tentative ("sensing," not seeing).</comment>
