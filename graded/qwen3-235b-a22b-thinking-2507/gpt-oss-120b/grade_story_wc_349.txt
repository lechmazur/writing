<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vendor's quest motivation clear but lacks internal contradiction; child's vapor notebook introduces relationship potential too late for meaningful pressure. "Weight of quest dissolve" shows embodied emotion but no enduring flaw complicates choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: child uncapping bottle crystallizes "silence into story" with visible cost (vendor's dissolved purpose). Orientation anchors by word 15. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density escalation but "glimmering parole" concept remains abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass branches and bottled moonlight constrain choices: moonlight fractures dictate script ignition, branches scatter droplets to ink "origin." Final silver letters charge closure. Sensory hierarchy favors tactile light physics over tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding story origins) tightens via vendor's void-counting method, narrowing options to quantifying absence. Cost legible in dissolved quest weight. Pressure grows through moonlight brightening but stakes remain conceptual rather than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "measuring nothingness" becomes light, "silent breath" precedes stories. Avoids moralizing but final "silence into story" whisper risks thematic echo. Non-literal answer to "where stories begin" resonates via inked floor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "voids grow louder," "shards like constellations." Rhythmic control peaks in incising sequence ("humming as if aware of fragmentary tone"). No POV slippage despite poetic compression. Child's vapor notebook maintains voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "spilling silver onto floating aisles" to "inked floor with silver letters" shows purposeful recurrence. Minor density issue in "mindfully scattered" repetition. Final beat's "cool silver thread weaving" avoids figurative muddle while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "quantifying absence" as narrative engine feels inevitable. Glass orchard transforms library tropes through physics of light/reflection. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens meaning but "glimmering parole" borders on derivative phrasing.</comment>
