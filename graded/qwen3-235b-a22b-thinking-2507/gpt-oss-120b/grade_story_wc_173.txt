<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lacks interior contradiction; motivation clear but no visible struggle with conformity's pull. "Bodily poetic cadence" embodiment strong yet flaws don't complicate choices. Final renunciation earned but cost feels conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("rebellion, once a hush, now a hymn") under Accumulative lens. Orientation clear by line 3, but "alarm of serenity" concept slightly asserted rather than fully earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Snow and prism function as micro-setting that charges final image ("snow whispered a promise"), yet neither constrains choices during key beats. Sensory detail vivid but environmental pressure on tactics remains implied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defying conformity) signaled early with meaningful deepening as echoes accumulate. Escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure spikes; threads "loosen" passively without visible cost paid during untangling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "echoes as rebellion" motif. Final image reweights conformity into "hymn" without moralizing, though "alarm of serenity" borders on abstract assertion in peak beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("air tasted of ice and ink") with rhythmic control. Peak-beat compression works, but "bodily poetic rhythm" abstraction risks therapy-speak without sufficient embodied struggle.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Overwriting in high-pressure sequence: "thousand tiny suns trapped within glass" and "scent of unresolved poems" blur action during thread-untangling. Template cadence ("She approached... She traced...") dulls immediacy near climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-based rebellion with "chaste courtesan" paradox. Prism mechanics feel derivative, but "alarm of serenity" transforms familiar motifs through specific sensory logic without gimmickry.</comment>
