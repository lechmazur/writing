<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Selric’s humility versus yearning for sacred simplicity, embodied through micro-choices like unstrapping the spellbook—a physical release of expectation that alters his magic’s expression without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost: his dissolved reputation and the fading "brilliant dimness" upon descent crystallize humility’s price under the Accumulative/Textural lens, where luminance density reweights the mechanized world’s stakes without causal shortcuts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The icebound spire’s micro-setting constrains choice (narrow ledge, mist-walking) and charges the final image—Selric’s heart as a "garden folly keystone"—proving environment’s necessity when the spire "breathes" in response to his touch, avoiding static symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through atmospheric pressure alone: the keystone’s "lingering luminance" deepens from rumored anchor to embodied memory of forgotten wonders, narrowing options to humility’s acceptance with the visible cost of his magic’s quiet glow replacing fireworks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the keystone’s final pulse scattering luminance "like fireflies that refused to be measured," reweighting "sacred in the simple" as active resistance to mechanization without moralizing—a resonant answer in the mist-soft footsteps lighting "dim corners."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>Perceptual signature is immaculate: Selric’s bias toward "brilliant dimness" filters every detail (e.g., fog echoing "with a faint chime"), while rhythmic control under pressure ("He sensed that the stone’s glow was not just light but a memory") avoids syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "painting the world in a brilliant dimness that felt both hopeful and mournful" exemplifies high-density propulsion where metaphor clarifies emotional stakes without muddling closure’s cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms the "underachiever" trope through specific, irreplaceable details: "silver cords" binding the spellbook and "mist walking" as humility’s method synthesize emotional truth with fresh mechanics, avoiding safety-hedging in Selric’s earned quietness.</comment>
