<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation ("translate isolation into independence") is clear but lacks contradictory impulses; her reverence for the whale remains static without internal struggle. Embodied emotion shines via the sundial-as-compass, yet "contemporary of extinct sky-whale" backstory feels ornamental rather than driving choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with cost in "brittle awakenings... delicate beginnings," but the stone circle’s hum—key escalation mechanism—lacks setup, making its power feel unearned. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, yet non-closure accumulation (-0.8) caps score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The brass sundial constrains choices (placement, recording resonance) and charges the final image as a "compass," elevating setting beyond postcard description. Clouds and whale bones mirror internal states through action, avoiding overt symbolism while anchoring early.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stakes (isolation→independence) are signaled early but lack organic escalation; the stone circle’s hum resolves problems it didn’t create, violating "coincidence may complicate, not resolve." Agency feels passive as Mira follows a "simple method" without obstacles.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sundial reflections and "brittle awakenings," avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights isolation as "delicate beginnings," yet the whale’s memory-as-bridge feels slightly pat without deeper moral ambiguity in the resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tome humming softly," "sea of ink") reflects Mira’s scholarly reverence. Rhythmic control deepens under pressure ("Each footfall resonated... sending shards of light"), with no POV leaks despite lyrical density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Figurative muddle in "atomically reflective" repetition (4x) and "sea of ink" metaphor dilutes closure impact. No loops in final beat, but density issues in high-pressure moments prevent 8.0+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal library and sky-whale bones feels organic, yet "brittle awakenings" leans on familiar eco-grief tropes without transformative specificity. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure succeeds but lacks the 9+ "inevitable in hindsight" quality.</comment>
