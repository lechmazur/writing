<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority excels via embodied choices (calibrating chemicals, tripod sinking) but lacks contradictory impulses; grief is palpable yet motivation remains abstractly archivist-driven without personal stakes beyond professional duty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "darkened stripe on the film" proves the universe received the offering, with cost legible in "tremor of grief" as the grain vanishes—Accumulative lens held via atmospheric pressure building to this crystallized moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting constrains choices: powdery basalt affects tripod stability, chemical vapor’s fade charges the final image; "basalt ridge" and "pale plume" evolve from description to embodied cost, avoiding symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist’s agency: chemical countdown forces the decisive capture moment, narrowing options to "now or never" with felt cost in "grief" as the grain’s vanishing; dominant stake (preserving vanishing history) tightens relentlessly under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through "captured breath of time" reweighting the hourglass grain; avoids moralizing via concrete particulars (whispered line echoing hush), with final image offering resonant answer to transience without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("visor reflecting thin silver glow," "dust stirred the world seemed to hold its sigh") with rhythmic control under pressure; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "pale plume of vapor rising like a ghost" exemplifies high-density prose doing triple duty (image/action/theme) without muddle; final line’s heartbeat echo achieves propulsion and closure charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms hourglass trope through lunar archaeology and chemical method; "dawning hush" as active concept (not mood) and grain as "lighthouse" feel inevitable yet fresh, with risk-taking (lyric Accumulative lens) heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
