<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; mapkeeper’s passive guidance by ice ("fingertips settled into rhythm") undercuts agency. Motivation clear but no visible internal struggle—resolution feels unearned as quiet arrives coincidentally without personal cost beyond abstract vigilance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost ("ever ready to conjure another bloom of hush"), but escalation lacks causal pressure: energy beings depart without mapkeeper’s direct action, weakening "because/therefore" under Accumulative lens. Orientation anchors solidly by 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (ice cracks) constrains choice and charges final image: their melting "dripping silence" directly enables the stone’s function. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—crisis narrows to vibrations, calm admits "sapphire light" glow—avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quiet vs. storm) signaled early, but pressure doesn’t tighten meaningfully: mapkeeper’s solution feels procedural, not pressured. Cost (perpetual vigilance) stated but not viscerally felt; energy beings’ departure relies on coincidence, undermining agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "quiet... balance between echo and silence" reweighted by final image of smooth ice and gold-traced map. Avoids moralizing; epiphany earned through ice’s transformation ("jagged edges softened"), resisting tidy binaries while charging emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fractures held a map," "dripping silence") shows character-specific noticing. Rhythmic control falters under peak pressure—voice remains uniformly lyrical during energy beings’ arrival without degradation (e.g., no fragmented syntax).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor scaffold: "He began his work by examining..." followed immediately by action description. No loops, but "gently luminous" repetition (stone/aura) edges toward thematic echo. Final image ("caves breathed a steady lull") avoids muddle with high propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of geological/acoustic concepts ("hammered repose," "ripple-mark skin") avoids fantasy tropes. "Bloom of hush" risks cliché but gains specificity through ice-crack mechanics. Transformation test passed: replacing "mapkeeper" with generic "healer" would break causal logic.</comment>
