<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses; motivation lacks internal friction. The tutor's calm execution of ritual shows no struggle against his own flaws under pressure, reducing emotional complexity to serene certainty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lacks legible cost: the compass aligning with "cerulean regret" feels earned but offers no visible sacrifice or irreversible change. "Sorrow loosening" is abstract, failing the cost proof test at the ending beat where concrete loss must anchor redemption.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setting details like petrichor-scented wind and mossy stone create vivid atmosphere, but the islet never constrains choices. Rain’s cessation enables action yet doesn’t pressure decisions, missing the 9+ gate where environment must shape tactics or final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes ("diffusing sorrow") remain static; pressure never escalates beyond the tutor’s predictable ritual. Each instruction step succeeds without complication, violating accumulative lens requirements for density increase or pattern break that reweights the dominant stake with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "cerulean regret" imagery, but the final line explicitly defines apologies as "a feeling—quiet, cool, and endlessly returning," crossing into thematic echo that states the concept rather than letting the image resonate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in tactile descriptions ("hands as gentle as wind-kissed leaves"), though rhythmic control falters during the ritual sequence where repetitive "lace" motifs create template cadence without teaching a payoff pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Overwriting in climax: "cerulean regret" and "rhythmically placid" repeat like a mantra, diluting impact. The compass’s "soft glow" bathes the scene in vague abstraction rather than concrete sensory propulsion, muddying closure’s emotional charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Tropes (wise mentor, magical object resolving grief) feel familiar; specificity in "antique lace pattern" instructions offers freshness but lacks transformation. The premise remains a poetic metaphor without the risky, concrete emotional calculus needed for high-band originality.</comment>
