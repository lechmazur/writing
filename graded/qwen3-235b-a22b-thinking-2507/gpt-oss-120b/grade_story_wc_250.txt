<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Allegorical construct lacks interior contradiction or embodied struggle; motivation stated but not tested through micro-choices under pressure. "Silent empathy" remains abstract concept without visible cost or tradeoffs during pivotal moments like the mirror alignment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with atmospheric deepening, but closure lacks legible cost—fisherman's gratitude feels unearned rather than stemming from visible sacrifice. Orientation clear early, yet "reverent applause" resolution softens tension without concrete forfeiture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dental mirror functions as essential micro-setting: constrains action (aligning with moon), charges final image ("lowered the dental mirror, its mission complete"), and evolves from tool to thematic anchor. Cobalt dock's wet planks actively shape movement ("slick and reflective") with sensory precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract—"teaching darkness" lacks concrete resistance or narrowing options. Escalation falters as ripples slow without dramatic consequence; "stillwater tension" dissipates too neatly, failing to manifest visceral cost under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through water/mirror motifs without moralizing, but resolution oversimplifies ("darkness had finally tasted starlight"). Final image reweights "stillwater tension" into "gentle reverie," yet avoids meaningful ambiguity about teaching's true difficulty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "spiralingly calm" diction and light-focused noticing; rhythmic control sustains lyrical compression. Avoids dialogue pitfalls (none present), though "half-spoken secret" phrasing edges toward abstraction under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, but "spiralingly calm" repetition and "stillwater tension" echoes create subtle synonym loops in closure beats. Figurative language ("lattice of light unfurled") remains coherent without muddle, though "secret fireflies" verges on sentimental.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dental mirror as star-weaving tool transforms light-in-darkness trope through concrete mechanics. Emotional specificity in "ripples of gratitude" avoids abstraction, though allegorical framing limits human complexity. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
