<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "feral nostalgia" as embodied yearning, but "chronologically confused" remains descriptive rather than driving micro-choices under pressure during the grave realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully when the grave transforms into "a marker for stories yet to tell," with felt cost in the "shallow indentation" and "jealous echoes," though causality slightly softens the conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The birch bark scroll’s evolving texture—from "sap of yesterday’s storm" to "humming restless tune"—constrains choices and charges the final image, making setting inseparable from the narrator’s thematic struggle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through textural accumulation ("wind carve new stories into my skin" to grave reinterpretation), but the single escalation lacks a tangible price paid during the dream sequence that would elevate cost legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the grave’s reframing as "stories yet to tell," avoiding moralizing, though "jaded wonder" risks becoming a thematic echo without sufficient friction in the final realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature thrives in "letters rearrange themselves as if jealous," but reflective passages slightly dilute psychic distance during the dream sequence, bordering on expository interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose glimmers with textural precision ("pine scented air thin against the cracked window"), yet dense lyrical clusters in the dream sequence risk overwriting without clear pattern-teaching in high-pressure moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</comment><question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "feral nostalgia" with dream chronicle elevates tropes, though the grave’s conceptual twist leans slightly on familiar lyrical closure patterns without radical transformation.</comment>
