<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (dream as burden/companion) is embodied through tactile actions like inscribing numerals, but the verbatim repeated reflection fragment violates BRR and undermines micro-choice credibility during pivotal recall.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost ("warm ember" replacing burden), but verbatim repetition of the rain-roof memory creates paraphrase loops that obscure causality and violate Accumulative lens coherence at the climax beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (pulse answer) and constrains choice through its whispering guidance, though the sanctuary's "soundless" quality remains underutilized as active constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes (making peace with abandoned dream) tighten through sensory accumulation, but the protagonist's agency is undermined when the crystal "guides his hand"—coincidence complicates but nearly resolves the conflict, weakening escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through memory-counting clock imagery reweighted at closure, but "excruciatingly gentle" becomes thematic echo in the final paragraph, bordering on prompt-like language that risks sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (gears/rain focus) and rhythmic control shine in quiet moments, but elevated diction like "excruciatingly gentle" clashes with the scribe's implied lexicon during peak pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops (identical rain-memory passage) and "excruciatingly gentle" overuse in the closure beat create scaffold that dulls the final pulse image; filter-verb stacks cluster in reflection sections.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clockmaker trope with memory-counting premise elevates emotional truth, but the "bear" motif feels derivative (untamable companion → haunting winter bear) without sufficient transformation.</comment>
