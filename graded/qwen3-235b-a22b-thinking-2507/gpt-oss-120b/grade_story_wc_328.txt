<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation ("turn bitterness into cosmic joke") remains abstract despite vivid embodied details like "frost on coat mirroring icy optimism." Final choice (placing arrowhead) feels earned but lacks contradictory impulses; "weight of dead ends turning into a joke" veers toward diagnostic label-speak in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: arrowhead's shattering releases light that transforms moss, reconfiguring sorrow into "frostbitten hope" with visible cost (shattered artifact, dissolved bitterness). Accumulative lens holds through humming-to-silver moss progression, though "cosmic joke" phrasing slightly risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Underground garden functions as micro-setting: arrowhead's gravitational pull makes moss sway, then vines form scaffold lifting the phone, directly constraining climax tactics. Final image ("frost on coat mirroring garden’s icy optimism") charges closure, though herbalist's role remains ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's agency (placing arrowhead) intensifies static from "nervous pulse" to laughter shifting "mournful to mischievous," narrowing options via arrowhead's destruction. Cost ("bitterness loosen") feels conceptually legible but lacks visceral embodiment in the shattering moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "frostbitten hope" motif reweighted by sunrise ("frost can melt into laughter"), avoiding moralizing except borderline "cosmic joke" phrasing. Final image crystallizes darkness-as-shareable-joke without stating moral, though beast's "fragment of forgotten song" insight edges toward earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("phosphorescent moss humming," "static-laden confessions") with rhythmic control during tension ("The arrowhead shattered"). Minor register drift in "gravitationally playful" repetitions, but voice modulates perfectly from chilled observation to cosmic resonance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("gravitational pull tugged at very air") with clear propulsion. Slight cadence template in final paragraph ("I walked... emerged... felt") prevents 9.0, but no figurative muddle—phosphorescent moss and draining phone battery create crystalline imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cryptid myth (beast as "fragment of forgotten song") and sentient garden avoids tropes. "Gravitationally playful" twist on gravity feels fresh, though "cosmic joke" risks familiarity; emotional truth in bitterness-to-laughter transformation elevates beyond surface novelty.</comment>
