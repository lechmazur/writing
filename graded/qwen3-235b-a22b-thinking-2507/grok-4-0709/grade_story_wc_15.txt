<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation ("carve path from ruin to reverence") drives choices, but internal contradiction lacks depth; "hauntingly optimistic" trait shown through actions yet remains somewhat archetypal without deeper flaw exploration. Micro-choices like clutching the plate as "call to action" reveal values, but emotional progression feels streamlined.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis with visible cost: transformed labyrinth (bridged chasm, orchid garden) proves labor's tangible impact. Accumulative lens holds through patterned sleepwalking overlaps that deepen communal mending, though sleepwalking mechanics' motivation remains slightly opaque yet fitting for textural design.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Red canyon labyrinth actively constrains choices (paths must intersect) and charges closure ("walls no longer echoing despair but whispering hope"). Bioluminescent moss blooming only post-tide creates natural urgency, though "orchid solace" description occasionally verges on ornamental rather than pressure-driven.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transforming ruins into reverence) tightens through each sleepwalking encounter: chasm bridge mends isolation, orchid garden defies barrenness, altar tapestry achieves rebirth. Cost is legible in tangible landscape changes, with agency shown through Elara's persistent action despite amnesiac state.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Broken precedents" emerges organically through plate imagery and sleepwalkers defying isolation; final image of "red walls whispering hope" resonates without moralizing. Avoids false equivalence by showing concrete community benefits (healing orchids, new tide pools), though "ghosts could dance toward dawn" borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature notices textures ("frayed plate edges") and floral sensations; rhythm modulates from short action phrases ("She moved in a trance") to lyrical descriptions. Consistent voice avoids POV slippage, though "eerie faith" feels slightly stock but compensated by concrete details like "threads in her hands" at dawn.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>No prose artifacts; sentences advance imagery ("threading verses into nets that caught not fish, but fleeting dreams"). Figurative language serves theme ("mending a fractured world with golden threads"), though "hauntingly optimistic" borders on label but is immediately embodied through action. Closure beat remains vivid and clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "healing through art" trope via specific sleepwalking mechanics and tide-dependent bioluminescence. Fresh inflection in using communal somnambulance to break isolation precedent, avoiding sentimentality by grounding hope in physical change (bridged chasm = new resources), though emotional specificity could deepen further.</comment>
