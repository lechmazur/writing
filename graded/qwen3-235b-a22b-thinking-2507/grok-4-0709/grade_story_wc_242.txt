<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority excels through ritualized actions ("fingers dancing over wires") and embodied contradiction in the self-loop confession. Minor deduction for slightly neat epiphany lacking deeper flaw engagement beyond isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "Elias froze" crystallizes cost of isolation with dawn's approach reweighting "begin anew." Accumulative lens holds via patterned loops, though musician's callback edges toward convenient coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tunnel functions as active micro-setting: "narrow passages carrying sounds" directly enables Elias's work, while the glass disc's physical handling ("spun with wet fingers") constrains choices and charges the final image of above-ground light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stake (Elias's self-imposed isolation vs. connection need) tightens through his agency in creating the self-loop. Cost is unmistakable in his frozen state and the "hum of streetlamps" backdrop during the musician's call.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: the "loop" mechanic reconfigures "endings/beginnings" without moralizing. Final image ("above ground, in the light") resonantly answers the central question through concrete spatial shift, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sensory selectivity ("damp concrete," "tinny bell") and rhythmic control during high-pressure beats. Minor deduction for one elevated phrase ("conceptual repricing" equivalent) in peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence propels atmosphere or character. "Melodically haunted" motif gains precision through repetition. Final line achieves image-based charge without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "wise mentor" trope via specific mechanics (glass harmonica, call-looping). Emotional truth in Elias's quiet epiphany avoids sentimentality, with tunnel setting feeling freshly necessary rather than generic.</comment>
