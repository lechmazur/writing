<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to find beauty in incompleteness drives all actions credibly, with embodied emotion in noticing "raindrops lingered on fern leaves." Lacks contradictory impulses in peak beats—his flaw (idealizing fragmentation) isn't tested by the drake's suffering, missing the 9+ quick test's requirement for simultaneous conflicting drives during the healing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Earned Stasis under Accumulative/Textural lens: the scarred drake's flight crystallizes "beauty discovered in fragments" with visible cost ("scars remained, feathers still sparse"). Pressure tightens through sensory density ("discord thrummed," "ragged breathing"), and the cost proof lands precisely in the final image's "imperfection."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The lagoon constrains choices—Elias finds the feather in damp sand, tends the drake in rock alcoves—and charges the closure as "the cobalt lagoon held the memory." Sensory details (petrichor, sapphire gleam) reflect urgency, with crisis narrowing perception to the drake's "labored breaths," fulfilling the 9+ gate by shaping tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens deepens through Elias's agency: his verses sync with the drake's pain, transforming "discordant growls into harmonious sighs." The cost ("scars remained") is unmistakable, but the dominant stake's tightening lacks a trade-off—no visible sacrifice like lost solitude or poetry—preventing 9.0 despite coherent pressure buildup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the feather's "frayed edges," the drake's "scars," and driftwood verses reweight "beauty in the incomplete" without moralizing. The final image ("beauty discovered in fragments") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, avoiding Thematic Echo by embodying insight through action rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice has a distinct perceptual signature ("waves murmured secrets to the shore") and rhythmic control that modulates under pressure (softer cadence during healing). No head-hopping; the Accumulative pattern is taught early with "burnished hush" recurring to charge closure, though minor register drift occurs in "latent warmth pulse" (should be "pulsed").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose avoids loops with high density ("footsteps soft as unspoken verses"), but "burnished hush" overuse risks purple prose in the climax. Rhythm varies effectively (short phrases for tension: "ragged breathing"), yet the grammatical slip "warmth pulse" slightly dulls closure clarity, preventing 9.0 despite otherwise clean propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms the mythical healer trope through specific, grounded choices: drakes as "guardians of the dawn" weaving light, with emotional truth in finding grace in "suspension." Fresh inflection lies in scars as "profound beauty," avoiding abstraction, though the premise risks derivative echoes without the lagoon's tangible constraints.</comment>
