<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("skepticism cracked") and embodied emotion ("eyelids heavy," "adrenaline surge") are strong, but the final realization about his father lacks micro-choice evidence beyond turning the wheel; closure feels slightly over-articulated for peak crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis (burden release via valve turn) lands with conceptual cost (swallowed truth reinterpreted), but Hybrid lens falters at midpoint: radio calls' thematic mirroring feels coincidental rather than causally integrated, weakening escalation under Situational pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Beaded valve wheel functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image (beads clicking like rosary prayers, water trickle washing dust), perfectly satisfying the 9+ gate; tunnel's decay directly enables the ghost shift manifestation and Alex's physical interaction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth's weight) tightens meaningfully when ghosts appear, but radio calls force thematic mirroring rather than Alex's agency driving escalation; cost (burden release) is felt but not visibly paid until the very end, slightly delaying legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through valve/glass beads and ghost labor, but the final line ("reluctant bridge to forgiveness") states the moral explicitly, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty (-0.7) for sermonizing in the closing image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("drowsy alertness," "hush following confession") and rhythmic control shine, though "skepticism cracked" momentarily shifts into diagnostic label-speak during peak stress without embodied cost within 3 lines.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density and concrete verbs prevail, but paraphrase loops mar momentum: "drowsy alertness" repeats identically in three beats, and "swallowed truth" metaphor recurs without meaningful variation, triggering a -0.4 loop penalty in high-pressure sections.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of factory ghost lore with personal confession avoids tropes, but the radio talk-show device feels like a writing-template convenience; emotional specificity in the valve interaction elevates it beyond generic "haunted object" narratives.</comment>
