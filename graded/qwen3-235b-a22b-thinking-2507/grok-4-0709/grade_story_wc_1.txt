<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied contradiction (shattered yet adaptive) but "adaptive ancestors" label weakens struggle; climax insight lacks concrete cost—tears swell without tradeoff for the 8.8+ gate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands (charcoal legacy reweighted as hope), but cost remains abstract—"tears welled" lacks visceral price; Orientation Test passes canyon anchor, yet cost proof fails per Q2 9+ test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frost patterns function as micro-setting that actively constrains choices (must follow before melt) and charges final image (pigments capturing frost); canyon’s chill and luminosity deepen thematic resonance without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via frost-ledge alignment, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—environment reveals path rather than Elara’s choices narrowing options; dominant "purpose in pauses" stake deepens but cost isn’t physically charged in final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through charcoal-to-light transformation; avoids moralizing with "illuminate shadows" note reweighting legacy. Near-slip: "enduring light" edges toward sentimentality but saved by concrete pigment imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (glass artist noticing crystalline veins, luminosity) with rhythmic control; "drifting resonance" repetition feels intentional pattern. Slight register drift in "ephemeral yet revealing" but paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero closure-touching artifacts; high density with "frost etching crystalline veins" doing triple duty. Minor paraphrase loop ("fractured thoughts"/"shattered remnants") deducts 0.2—no impact on escalation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Synthesizes smuggling trope with glass artistry via charcoal’s duality; canyon’s frost as cipher feels fresh. Transformation test passed—plot fails if setting/character swapped—but hedged safety in legacy’s moral clarity caps at 8.8.</comment>
