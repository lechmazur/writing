<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation for "meaning in the mess" remains abstract despite concrete actions; social perceptiveness shown via observed gestures but lacks contradictory impulses in peak beat when interjecting. Final endurance of chaos earns closure yet interior conflict lacks layered irrationality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "emergent hush" crystallizes shared understanding with felt cost in "lilac unease softening into tentative peace." Orientation clear by word 20; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through mandala density buildup without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grotto’s mist actively constrains creation (damp ground) and charges closure via parted fog revealing understanding. Lilac-hued discomfort evolves from "violet tension" to "glow," with sand grains/tile flake as micro-setting that directly shapes the mandala’s causal role in resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through mandala’s escalating density, narrowing options from isolated whispers to collective sand-sifting. Cost is visceral in "lilac unease softening" but lacks tangible trade-off; protagonist agency drives the interjection yet external pressure (grotto’s echoes) dominates escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through sand patterns reconfiguring "regrets" into "shared path," avoiding moralizing. Final image ("lilac glow" of transformed unease) offers non-literal answer to "meaning in mess" without stating thesis, though "unlearning’s gentle power" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in artist’s color-focused noticing ("vibrant blues, earthy reds") and rhythmic control ("whispers danced like ghosts") persists under pressure. Minor register drift in "unlearning" concept slightly disrupts voice coherence in high-stakes interjection beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "violet tension that perfumed the fog" exemplifies textural specificity. One near-redundancy in "whispering gallery tile flake" repetition (beat 1 vs 3) slightly dulls momentum, but closure image ("lilac glow") remains sharp and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms "unlearning" trope via tactile sand mandala mechanics and grotto’s echo physics. Emotional truth in group’s shared vulnerability avoids genericity, but "lilac unease" risks symbolic convenience without deeper physiological grounding in the artist’s experience.</comment>
