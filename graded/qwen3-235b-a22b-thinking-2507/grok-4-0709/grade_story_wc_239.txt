<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Witness's motivation is clear but lacks internal contradiction; cosmic task feels effortless with no visible struggle or cost paid, weakening earned closure despite vivid interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost (cosmic unity restored), but the universe's hiccup lacks tangible pressure escalation; no felt sacrifice from Witness undermines causality under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Temple library’s "petrified starlight" shelves and dictionary constrain choices; the worn dictionary charges the final image as the tool that binds illusions, meeting 9+ gate via micro-setting necessity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract despite "fraying threads of reality"; pressure escalates through cosmic hiccups but lacks protagonist-driven trade-offs, with resolution feeling convenient rather than earned under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of unity beyond illusion emerges organically through spiral arbitration’s reprise; final image ("closed dictionary... echoes of profound unity") offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "resounding hush" and "wanderingly exact" lexicon; rhythmic control deepens under pressure with purposeful elision taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Figurative density risks muddling climax ("veils tearing in silent symphony"); minor scaffold in "empires crumbling, stars winking out" dilutes propulsion despite otherwise vivid specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Spiral arbitration" transforms cosmic conflict tropes through concrete dictionary mechanics; risk-taking in lyric escalation feels inevitable, though Witness archetype limits emotional specificity.</comment>
