<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "vengeance disguised as closure" and embodied watch-fob micro-choices, but merchant's wavering lacks depth. Final renunciation of vengeance-through-sound earns cost via abandoned shipment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change when trust shatters ("gasping fist"), with visible cost in abandoned shipment. Causal escalation tightens options cleanly, though merchant's sudden doubt slightly strains causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rotting pier’s sensory constraints (creaking wood, lantern light) directly enable false starts. Watch fob as micro-setting charges closure: "heavy with the echo of justice" reweights the heirloom’s meaning through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single stake (capture trust-breaking sound) drives escalation: each false start narrows Thorne’s options. Cost is unmistakable in "shipment abandoned" and Elara’s shifted identity ("avenged"). Agency flawless under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through shattered "truce of hush" without moralizing. Final image—dawn, heavy fob—resonantly answers vengeance’s cost by reweighting "comforting unease" into earned justice. No thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lanterns flickered like uneasy stars") modulates rhythm under pressure. Voice stays character-bound; "pier’s creaks a comforting rhythm" shows stress-distorted perception without diagnosis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "shattering like a distant gunshot" compresses tension without muddle. Final line avoids sentimentality with concrete charge: "watch fob heavy with the echo of justice" propels closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms revenge trope via specific mechanism (sound recording). Risk-taking with auditory climax works organically; emotional specificity in "balm for old wounds" avoids generic vengeance.</comment>
