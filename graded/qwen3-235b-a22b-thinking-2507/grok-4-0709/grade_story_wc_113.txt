<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation (itching fingers, weight of history) but "lately inspired" remains abstract; ghost interaction lacks relational pressure. Final transformation feels earned though contradictory impulses during climax are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with strong Charged Poise closure. Water damage evolution and sonic disruption create valid pressure, but "lately inspired" motivation lacks causal linkage to the disruptive choice, slightly muddying cost legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Flooded opera house actively constrains choices (wading, retrieving program) and charges the final image. Waterlogged instruments as "drowned dreams" exemplifies micro-setting integration that shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding ghost's message) tightens through water damage revealing images, but escalation leans on atmospheric coincidence rather than protagonist agency. Cost (transformation) is visible but not deeply felt under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"In-between spaces" theme resonates through unstruck chords and water-damaged images without moralizing. Final image of "unstruck chords once again" offers non-literal answer to bridging worlds, avoiding thematic echo despite supernatural premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Musician's perceptual signature shines: "bow hovered, engaging in silent exchange" shows rhythmic control under pressure. Prose texture mirrors cello dynamics ("screech that echoed through rafters") with zero POV slippage or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless density ("water damage spread like inkblots, not ruining but transforming") but minor paraphrase loop with "lately inspired" and slight redundancy in final line ("once again"). No closure-dulling artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of musician's craft with ghost lore through water-damaged decryption. Avoids derivative tropes via specific orchestral details ("unstruck chords where spirits dwelled"), though emotional risk-taking slightly lacks boldness.</comment>
