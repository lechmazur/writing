<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Limited interior contradiction; motivation clear but lacks deep conflict. Strength: embodied emotion in calcification ritual. Weakness: wanderers function as props without mutual pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("boundaries emerged from the boundary-less void"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, but cost proof slightly oblique in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kerosene lamp burner constrains every choice and charges the final liberation. Micro-setting mastery: tool evolves from ritual object to liberation mechanism without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency (orienting/calcifying), but wanderers' burdens lack visceral weight. Cost visible in her transformation, though secondary stakes feel abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "calcify" metaphor reweighting burdens as liberation tools. Avoids moralizing; final image answers central question ("boundary-less trapped" → finite form) without stating moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("whalebone reverie," "shingled hush") modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control in high-stakes calcification beats; no head-hopping despite lyrical density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "fractal shadows" description, but zero loops in closure beat. High density with "lime-hardened weight" crystallizing abstract stakes; no figurative muddle at climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mathematical and emotional burdens, but "boundary-less" concept lacks radical transformation. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though premise echoes Borges.</comment>
