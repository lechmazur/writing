<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (logic vs intuition) drives key choices like abandoning digital indexer; embodied emotion via tactile memory shift during blackout. Final identity shift as 'guardian' earns cost through prior verification act. Slight underdevelopment of emotional layering during discovery moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost: 'readjusting self-image from indexer to guardian' crystallizes identity loss. Causal lens holds perfectly—stamp verification directly triggers lineage revelation. Blackout pressure escalates options meaningfully without coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting (ink stamp's squid essence) constrains choice by enabling verification; toppled shelves from tremor charge closure. Sensory details filtered through indexer's logic ('patches of determination amid uncertainty'). Final 'determined light' recharges opening 'perpetual twilight' with cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally: blackout forces abandonment of digital tools, making stamp verification the only path. Cost is undeniable—'refugees sinking city deliberately' reframes her entire identity. Agency drives every escalation; blackout's timeframe creates live clock pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: verification stamp reweights 'reclaimed stillness' from isolation to active truth-reclamation. Final image ('secrets no longer sunken') answers central question without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by showing truth's cost through identity shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: 'dappled shadows mirrored resolve' reflects indexer's pattern-recognition. Rhythm modulates perfectly—short sentences during crisis ('locks sealed'), lyrical flow in reflection. Zero POV leakage; lexicon stays within character's logical framework.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; 'squid essence ink bloomed dark and true' does triple duty (sensory, thematic, plot). Final line recharges opening motif with precision. Peak-beat prose ('pressed the stamp... thud echoing') maintains clarity under pressure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: 'indexing as truth-seeking' transforms heritage trope. Stamp verification ritual feels inevitable yet original. Risks 'sunken city' cliché but transcends via specific mechanics (misindexed archives as deliberate obfuscation). Emotional specificity avoids generic revelation.</comment>
