<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; hope/endurance dominates without visible internal struggle. Final choice earned but emotional progression too tidy despite bleeding hands during search.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with star-path pattern driving escalation. Charged Poise closure lands with conceptual cost (proving meaning exists), though shard recovery slightly convenient. Orientation clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Glass pavilion provides atmospheric texture but doesn't constrain choices; thistles offer lyrical resonance yet fail to actively alter tactics. Final image charged but environment remains decorative rather than functional under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving coincidences have meaning) escalates through Elara's agency in star-path alignment. Conceptual cost—worldview validation—reweights options visibly as light draws survivors, fulfilling accumulative lens requirements cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: rekindling beacon *is* the non-literal answer to "coincidences have meaning." Avoids moralizing; final image of light reconfigures thistle-blown hope into certainty without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("thistle-blown hope," humming pavilion") modulates with pressure. Minor register drift in "serendipitous stars" but rhythmic control under stress maintains voice integrity throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Overwriting in "fragile hopes like thistles blown across barren fields, resilient yet adrift" creates density clash. Synonym loop ("resilient yet adrift" after "thistle-blown hope") slightly dulls closure image despite strong propulsion elsewhere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocognition with shard-of-hush concept avoids post-apocalyptic tropes. Emotional specificity in "thistle-blown hope" elevates beyond template, though timeframe lacks transformative risk-taking for higher band.</comment>
