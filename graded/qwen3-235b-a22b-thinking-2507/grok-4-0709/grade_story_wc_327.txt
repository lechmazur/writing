<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in key moments; motivation clear but interiority remains observational rather than embodying struggle under pressure. Final endurance feels earned yet insufficiently conflicted, missing micro-choices that would crystallize values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly with felt cost ("copper veins thrumming"), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through echo-layering density. But bird-pattern method appears too late to drive meaningful escalation, weakening pressure coherence despite strong orientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choices: bone towers amplify echoes, tunnel cracks position the diamond, and wind synchronizes birds. Final image charged by canyon singing textures. Misses 9+ gate as environment doesn't reshape tactics mid-scene—functions as backdrop rather than active pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (language preservation) is clear, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening. Birds' pattern resolves the method coincidentally rather than through earned adaptation, and residual energy cost isn't forged through struggle. Agency remains observational until climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through texture-to-sound translation, with final image ("quietly articulate symphony") reweighting loss as eternal resonance. Avoids moralizing while embracing complexity—language "death" becomes sonic rebirth. Lacks minor depth in showing cost's emotional texture beyond physical toll.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("copper-veined hand," texture-focused lexicon) and rhythmic control shine during chanting ("rising tones for ascents"). Minor deduction for repetitive "quietly articulate" descriptor, but voice modulates perfectly under pressure with taught lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops and high density, but borderline purple prose in "sun bleeding red over bone towers" slightly dulls momentum. Final line’s "translating touch into timeless sound" risks abstraction yet redeems itself through concrete prior imagery. No closure-impacting artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Synthesizes dying-language trope with fresh texture-sound alchemy and copper-vein specificity. Emotional truth anchors universals in lived detail ("bark-like rasp of 'endure'"). Lacks bold risk-taking—avoids the safety middle yet stops short of transforming tropes through irreversible stakes.</comment>
