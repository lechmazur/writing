<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interior contradiction absent; "mournfully eager" remains label without embodied conflict. No micro-choices under pressure—Elias acts uniformly, lacking contradictory impulses during pivotal "macerate" attempts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: "Elias remained" crystallizes eternal vigil cost. Accumulative lens holds—nightly repetitions narrow options to persistent haunting, with "final grain" imagery making conceptual cost undeniable at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tunnel setting actively constrains choices: fissures channel lullabies upward, drips form rhythmic pools mirroring melodies. Pull cord handle evolves from "lifeline to past" to instrument of healing, charging the final image of eternal vigil.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative escalation via nightly repetitions deepens grief’s "rigid edges" until cracks form. Protagonist agency (pulling cord) forecloses escape, with eternal haunting as visceral cost—"Elias remained" reweights options under undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through lullabies carrying "apologies never uttered," not abstraction. Final image ("laughter restored like a melody rediscovered") offers resonant, non-literal answer to grief’s dissonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: ghostly focus on textures ("translucent fingers," "gleaming pull cord"). Rhythmic control modulates with pressure—"dripping pipes formed rhythmic pools" echoes lullaby cadence, teaching pattern paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in "turning them into haunting echoes that seeped upward" (redundant verbs). No loops or scaffold, but "seeped" alone would tighten momentum; final line achieves crystalline resonance without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope through hyper-specific conductor occupation. "Macerate grief" metaphor feels inevitable, avoiding sentimentality via imperfect lullabies. Risk-taking heightens stakes—eternal haunting as cost—without gimmickry.</comment>
