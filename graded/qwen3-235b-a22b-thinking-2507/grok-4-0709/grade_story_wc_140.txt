<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("veils of what-ifs") but gains specificity through tactile memory textures; final renunciation of void for strength is earned though contradictory impulses lack simultaneous scene manifestation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: "nameless identity became a strength" reconfigures erasure with conceptual cost, though tidal rhythm’s pressure escalation remains atmospheric rather than constraining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Shipping containers function as potent micro-setting, but the poison label (recurring object) indispensably charges the final image; port atmosphere vividly anchors early yet environmental pressure doesn’t actively constrain choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming erased identity) deepens through fragment accumulation, but protagonist agency lacks visible trade-offs; tidal framework provides rhythm without tightening tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "textures" motif, avoiding moralizing; final line’s "testament to survival’s quiet defiance" offers resonant non-literal answer to erasure without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>Perceptual signature ("colors bled into sounds") is distinct and rhythm modulates under pressure, but repetitive "filtering reality differently" phrasing dulls immediacy in high-stakes beats like the poison label discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity ("brittle like old parchment") marred by scaffold loops: "filtering reality differently" repeats 4x with minimal variation, creating synonym churn that slightly dulls the closure beat’s impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms bureaucratic erasure trope through sensory memory textures; tidal rhythm and poison label synthesis feels inevitable, though premise remains adjacent to familiar literary tropes without radical reinvention.</comment>
