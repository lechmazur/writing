<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority lacks embodied contradiction; "doubt crept in" remains abstract despite mentor betrayal reference. Final choice lacks layered cost—Elias proves honesty too easily as ferns merely "stir slightly," missing micro-choices that would charge his renunciation of deception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis (light restored, covenant renewed) with visible cost: midnight's "whispering lies" cause ferns to wilt, forcing Elias to confront doubt. But "method of mending what isn't torn" isn't dramatized—it’s stated then magically succeeds, weakening causality at the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Resonance chamber’s crystalline veins amplify sound beautifully but never constrain choices; Elias could perform this ritual anywhere. The half-repaired music box charges the final image ("ballerina dancing"), yet rusted scrolls remain passive props rather than active environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via ferns wilting during midnight’s lie, narrowing Elias’s options to singing louder. But the cost lacks felt weight—the "whispering lies" cause no tangible sacrifice, and midnight’s resistance ("You cannot reclaim...") dissolves instantly when exposed, reducing escalation to a single, unearned reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of truth-as-repair emerges through ferns and covenant rust without moralizing. Final image ("covenant no longer rusted but renewed") reweights "mending the unseen" as resonant answer to "reclaiming light," avoiding tidy binaries while embracing the cost of confronting deception.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "prismatic light across the chamber" and "tinkersong of wonder," with rhythmic control during high pressure ("notes of golden curiosity"). But stress responses stay overly articulate ("ensuring his heart held no falsehood"), missing compression that would heighten authenticity under duress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose soars with "echoes danced like fireflies," yet "method of mending what isn’t torn" is abstract label, not demonstrated action. Overwriting in climax ("inky tendrils seeping through cracks") dulls immediacy, and template cadence ("He began by... Now came...") weakens propulsion in the final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Synthesizes music-box repair with alchemy into fresh "tinkersong" magic system. Risks pay off: Earned Stasis ending avoids cliché by focusing on covenant renewal over battle, yet "philosopher’s stone chip" feels derivative, lacking the specificity to elevate it beyond trope transformation.</comment>
