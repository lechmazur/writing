<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("dormant spark") with therapy-speak risking diagnostic labels; strong embodied action in snow-encoding scene but micro-choices lack contradictory impulses during pivotal handoff.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with conceptual cost (impermanent snow = trust sacrificed for safety), but "shattered network" stakes remain abstract; missing visceral price like Mira's hesitation revealing broken trust.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Snowdrift constrains choice (encoding method) and charges final image (melting as earned impermanence); "silver hush" overuse slightly dilutes specificity, yet mist actively enables secrecy and impermanence mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fixing network) lacks escalation—no moment where prudence nearly fails them; "prudently daring" remains thematic label without tradeoff cost (e.g., caution delaying encoding under time pressure).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from snow-encoding as quiet courage, avoiding moralizing; final line ("not in grand gestures...") earns resonance, but "unused courage waits" repetition edges toward thematic echo without sufficient friction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("mist softened outlines," "pristine canvases") with rhythmic control; minor POV drift in para 3 ("world itself was prudently daring") slightly disrupts spy’s embodied lexicon under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong propulsion but paraphrase loops: "prudently daring" repeated verbatim 3x, "unused courage waits" duplicated; opening’s "silver hush... forgotten secrets" risks purple prose without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh spy trope inversion (repair over action) with snow-encoding ingenuity, yet "burned spy" framework feels familiar; emotional specificity in quiet redemption elevates but lacks bold risk-taking beyond premise.</comment>
