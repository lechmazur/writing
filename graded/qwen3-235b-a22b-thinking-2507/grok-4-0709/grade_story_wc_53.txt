<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "ambitions erode, don't they?" but emotional layering slightly abstracts during ghost negotiation; embodied cost in camera wheel's warmth saves key moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "time realigned briefly" crystallizes options with cost in "regret washed over her... as catalyst"; Accumulative lens holds from carousel halt onward.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Kinetic lagoon currents directly constrain movement ("waded deeper, clouds parting"), while the camera wheel's tactile use charges the final image; micro-setting drives all pivotal choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's agency: collecting fragments escalates pressure toward ghost confrontation; "regret as catalyst" delivers unmistakable cost that reconfigures ambition's meaning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: "rebuild from the silt" reweights erosion without moralizing; final image of scavenging "whole in broken sky" resonates as earned non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct in "chronologically confused mind" noticing lagoon eddies like "cracked mirror"; rhythmic compression during ghost dialogue ("Why did you let them erode?") heightens pressure flawlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in "waters churned endlessly in defiance of gravity" but zero loops; "regret bloomed in her chest" avoids abstraction through visceral charge in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "eroded ambitions" with kinetic lagoon logic; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though ghost trope edges toward familiarity.</comment>
