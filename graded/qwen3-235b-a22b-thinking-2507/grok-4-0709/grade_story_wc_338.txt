<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction absent; "vulnerability of revelations" is diagnostic label-speak triggering penalty. Final understanding unearned as no prior struggle with empathy limits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Closure fails Accumulative lens: "portal to forgotten empathies" introduces new concept rather than reweighting prior patterns. Cost proof absent—no legible price paid for the revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details anchor setting early, but vault frescoes and map tear remain decorative rather than constraining choices. Tool (projector) functional but doesn't charge final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stakes ("reopening hidden lore") never materialize as concrete risk; escalation flat with no tightening under Accumulative lens. No trade-off or visible cost when vibration discovery occurs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme derailed by final paragraph's explicit "portal" statement—thematic echo penalty applies. Early silence-as-canvas motif abandoned for unearned supernatural repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tracing fragile parchment with precision of a map framer") shines, but "shielded openness" is therapy-speak. Rhythmic control falters at climax with abstract revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Minor synonym loops ("methodically curious... methodically set up") and "silence" repetition dilute density. No major artifacts, but climax's figurative muddle ("portal") dulls closure charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh angle on observation-driven archaeology undermined by clichéd "living stones" trope. Emotional truth in valuing silence is strong, but supernatural pivot lacks groundwork.</comment>
