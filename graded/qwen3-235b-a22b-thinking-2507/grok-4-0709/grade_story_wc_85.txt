<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority excels with embodied guilt ("fingers stained from forging documents"), but the final choice lacks contradictory impulses; the watch hand discovery triggers authentic emotion yet resolves too neatly without enduring tension between truth-telling and protection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully—the rusted watch hand crystallizes options with felt cost ("clutched in his palm"), though the "tempered peace" conclusion slightly over-explains the cost; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through driftwood sifting's patterned escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cobalt terrace and driftwood constrain choices: the terrace's "solitary refuge" pressures his isolation, while driftwood's physicality shapes sifting tactics; final stars "piercing the sky" charge closure by mirroring the watch hand's fragmented truth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully as the watch hand forces confrontation with buried truth, narrowing options from evasion to confession; Elias's agency in sifting drives escalation, though "motivation crystallize" risks diagnostic phrasing during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete sifting ritual, avoiding moralizing; the final whisper "into the wind" offers resonant answer to truth's weight. Slightly undercut by "shields tempering regret" bordering on thematic echo near closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinct perceptual signature ("driftwood littered the sand like remnants of shattered lives"), with rhythmic control deepening under stress; minor repetition of "sieved hush" dilutes precision in final beats despite lyrical cohesion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density falters in closure beat: "sieved hush followed him, a calmed silence where regrets were filtered" contains scaffold. Strong verbs ("whittled," "knelt") propel momentum, but filter-stack in high-pressure moment prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of genealogist-forger premise through tactile details (rusty watch hand, cobalt hues) avoids tropes; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though emotional arc lacks transformative surprise for 9+.</comment>
