<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lanara's dual allegiance—bohemian roots vs reformer alliances—but "hopeful desperation" edges toward label-speak despite embodied actions like clutching the stone chip. Final choice earned through prior encoding work, though micro-choices lack deeper tactical tradeoffs under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: dawn breaking with the raft's pulse strengthening after corporate envoy's arrival. Cost is visceral in "desperation clawed" versus communal resolve at the mural. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—density of encoded graffiti tightens options as scouts circle, reweighting unity as the only path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The foundation stone chip constrains choices (encoding inspiration) and charges the final image as keystone. Micro-setting mastery: cotton candy scents and Ferris wheels aren't backdrop but pressure points—carnival joy vs privatization threat. Only flaw: "sleek yachts" lacks tactile specificity in high-stakes moments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten under Accumulative lens as corporate scouts arrive during masquerade ball, forcing stance crystallization. Lanara's agency drives escalation—her encoded graffiti method shifts from covert signals to the mural's reorganization plan. Cost is felt in her emotional arc, though the crowd's intuitive gathering slightly softens the resolution's friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through stone chip's evolution from talisman to keystone, but final line ("proving that even afloat on uncertainty, foundations could be rebuilt") states the moral rather than letting the mural image resonate. Avoids sentimentality via concrete struggle, yet thematic echo caps resonance despite strong particulars like lotus/serpent codes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Lanara's "orderly intuitive" lens—grids mapping chaos, sensing tensions. Rhythmic control peaks during masquerade ball: "masks concealed identities and fireworks lit the waves" compresses tension. No head-hopping; compression of backstory (ritual chip removal) taught early and pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with "coiled serpent meant 'gather supplies at dawn'" doing triple duty. Final line's explanatory "proving" slightly dulls closure image, but "foundation stone chip gleamed under lantern light" offers textural specificity. No figurative muddle—metaphors serve pressure (e.g., "gentrification crept in subtly").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms gentrification trope through Raftoria's perpetual carnival logic and encoded graffiti resistance. Fresh inflection: using performer acts (juggling, dance) as message conduits. Avoids safety middle with morally ambiguous reformers, though privatization threat leans slightly generic. Stone chip's irreplaceability elevates synthesis.</comment>
