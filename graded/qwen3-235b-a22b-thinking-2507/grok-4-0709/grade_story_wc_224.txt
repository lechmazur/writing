<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses (substituting reality vs craving truth) drive pivotal choices; embodied pain ("hidden thunder in veins") avoids abstraction. Final renunciation of mercury-glass earned through tactile feather contact revealing buried village betrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density (feather barbs, stone hum) escalates toward Earned Stasis. Cost crystallized in "pain of remembering lingered, but it fueled her" and cracking mercury orb—no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mercury-glass orb (tool) constrains choices and charges closure via shattering; feather texture directly enables breakthrough. Bookstore setting pressures search but "entire mountain" scope slightly ornamental in pivotal beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding home's shape) tightens through textural deepening—feather contact narrows options to truth. Cost legible in visceral "pain of remembering" post-revelation; protagonist agency clear in seeding contact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme ("home as shape of shared talents") emerges from concrete particulars: valley "cupped hand" image reweighted by final "network of souls." Avoids moralizing; "wildflowers after rain" offers resonant non-literal closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("barbs soft yet edged like whispers of rain") with rhythmic control under pressure. Psychic distance shifts intentionally during feather contact; zero head-hopping despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "roots breaking through soil long fallow" crystallizes surge without muddle. High density in climax ("visions flooded her—not false ones... raw truths") with clear propulsion to dawn resolution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "home as talent-shape" transforms amnesia trope. Specificity ("valley cupped hand," feather texture key) avoids generic fantasy; risk-taking (textural resolution) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
