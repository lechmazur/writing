<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s "expectantly resigned" interiority shows contradictory impulses (hope/despair) in scene, but secondary characters lack distinct flaws or voice; the scarred young man weeps generically without specific motivation. Micro-choices like seating clans in circles reveal values, but townsfolk remain underdeveloped crucibles.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: Elara’s "harmony was fragile" admission crystallizes cost while the humming zither reconfigures vanishing arts with conceptual weight. Accumulative lens holds perfectly, but "knowing the arts would not vanish" slightly overstates the quiet endurance, diluting the felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The zither’s rosette constrains choices repeatedly—Elara uses its light to guide "subtracting noise," and it pulses during breakthroughs. Final image of the rosette as a "beacon" charges closure by reweighting the micro-setting’s significance against the vanishing arts theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara’s agency: the stormy gale session forces the elder’s weeping breakthrough, narrowing options toward fragile unity. Cost is visible in "harmony was fragile," but escalation lacks a second meaningful intensification beyond the initial subtraction method.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—"subtracting noise" transforms from technique to philosophy, with the final hum offering a non-literal answer to vanishing arts. Avoids moralizing; "braiding diverse voices" stays earned through session friction without prompt-like sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "crimson foliage outside" filters Elara’s artistic gaze, and syntax compresses under pressure ("She denoted breakthroughs by subtracting noise"). Rhythmic control modulates from lyrical reflection to staccato tension during the gale scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Traveled stillness" repeats four times, crossing into synonym churn that dulls the final hum’s impact. Otherwise flawless propulsion—phrases like "peeling away the cacophony" do triple duty—but the loop in closure prevents 9.0 despite high density elsewhere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Subtracting noise" reimagines harmony through precise, character-rooted action rather than stock "music heals" tropes. Risk-taking in accumulative structure pays off: the rosette’s evolving symbolism feels inevitable, avoiding middle-ground hedging with tangible emotional stakes.</comment>
