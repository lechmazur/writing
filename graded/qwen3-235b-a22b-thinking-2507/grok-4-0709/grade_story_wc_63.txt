<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via embodied guilt (callused hands tracing grooves) and micro-choices (secret carving), though "fractured the village's unity" edges toward abstraction. Final choice to integrate inscriptions earns closure with visible cost (faded handle, absorbed essence).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "subtle shift in time's flow" mends village rifts. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—the inscriptions' transfer to the bob crystallizes escalating pressure. Orientation anchors by word 25 with no disorientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Obsidian ridge actively constrains choices (shard for carving, heat mirages mirroring guilt) and charges closure. Micro-setting (rake handle) evolves from confessional relic to "whole in purpose," directly shaping the climax when pressed against the bob.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias's agency: the pendulum's pause forces crystallization of his stance, narrowing options to one decisive act. Cost is unmistakable—"fishermen returned with fuller nets" shows societal impact, reweighting the dominant stake via conceptual shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the bob's inscriptions transferring: "balance restored in tiny, diligent steps" avoids moralizing while reweighting guilt. Final image offers resonant answer to "shared balance" without stating a moral, though "ethical burden" slightly edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("waves crashed against jagged black glass") and rhythmic control under pressure—short sentences during reverie ("Heat miraged...") modulate tension. No head-hopping; stress compresses diction purposefully ("clarity born of diligent carvings").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("latent power" conveys spiritual weight economically). Figurative language serves pressure ("metronome of fate"), with final beat avoiding overwriting: "balance restored in tiny, diligent steps" lands cleanly without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms guilt trope through clock mechanics—absolution literally integrated into timekeeping. Risk-taking (lyric compression of "incremental" acts) heightens stakes; changing the obsidian ridge would break causality, proving specificity. Transformation test passed decisively.</comment>
