<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but lacks contradictory impulses; "healing through revealing" feels diagnostic rather than embodied under pressure. Tears mirroring Kwan Yin’s compassion provides strong embodied cost at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation clear early (attic studio/stormy night), closure lands as Charged Poise with cost (emptied vial, fog lifting). Escalation lacks protagonist agency—"method came to her intuitively" undermines causal pressure at pivotal turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Twilight viaduct’s luminous jasmine constrains choice (projection surface) and charges final image (blooms brightening). Sensory hierarchy perfectly filters through Elara’s urgency: fog, petals, and breath dictate perception during crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding unused love) signaled early but pressure remains passive; sparks appear via ritual rather than earned struggle. Cost (emptied vial) legible but lacks trade-off—no visible price paid during escalation beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "unused love" reframed as self-forgiveness requirement. Final image (path of clear sparks) reweights "foggy lucidity" without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality by grounding wisdom in bodily action (breathing).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice modulates with tension: lyrical during setup, compressed during breathing sequence. "Foggy lucidity" refrain risks monotony but gains resonance through embodied shifts. No POV leakage; perceptual bias consistently filters jasmine’s glow and vial’s mist.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity ("petals like stars," "foggy waves of lucidity") but filter-verb clusters ("felt the pull," "felt whole") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Opening/closing lines anchor voice with precise image-to-action shift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms "pilgrim of sparks" trope through concrete mechanics: breath-synced swaying, projection shifts. Emotional truth in "love poured forth but unabsorbed" avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (lyric ritual) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
