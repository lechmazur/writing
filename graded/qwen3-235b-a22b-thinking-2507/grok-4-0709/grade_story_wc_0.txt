<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her clinical detachment clashing with embodied grief over orchids; micro-choices like brushing dust then accepting decay reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost in "stripped the needless theatrics from her grief." No diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: her pruning with "acceptance" forecloses rage against entropy, with felt cost in "stripped the needless theatrics from her grief." Accumulative lens holds as dust patterns tighten pressure through chemical decay, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dust patterns function as micro-setting that charges the final image—"humbled by the dust's quiet lessons"—while constraining her choice to prune. Sensory details (iridescent powder, acid-laced dust) evolve causally with decay, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through dust's accumulation: initial observation becomes fractal decay that softens orchid stems and splinters trellis, narrowing options to acceptance. Cost is visible in "orchids' stems softened" and her altered actions, though escalation lacks one more intensification beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through dust's chemical etching mirroring neutron star decay; final image of "renewed reverence for the unscripted" reweights the premise without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by showing humility through pruning actions, not stating "change is gradual."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "microscopic marvel of evolution" reflecting her scientist POV; rhythmic control deepens under pressure with "petals sagging like deflated sails" → "fine dust... drifted onto her palm." No head-hopping, but one filter verb ("she realized") slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; high density as "acid-laced dust penetrated cell walls" conveys decay and character shift. Minor register drift in "preprocess reality" (academic term) disrupts voice in peak beat, but closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neutron star decay with butterfly dust patterns avoids template tropes; "fractals echoing pulsar emissions" transforms familiar humility arc through specific scientific lens. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry, though proximity to cosmic awe tropes prevents 9.0.</comment>
