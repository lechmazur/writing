<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in panic-to-acceptance shift during anchoring, but micro-choices under pressure lack layered irrationality; "hidden ember" motivation is clear but could deepen embodied conflict earlier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly—"body rooted while spirit lifts" crystallizes exile's cost under Accumulative lens; gaps widening to spontaneous anchoring creates undeniable pressure without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Garden actively constrains choice (vines binding Elara) and charges final image; "obsidian grace" atmosphere evolves from description to embodied force during ritual climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transcendence vs. forgetting) tightens when ritual unexpectedly roots her; cost is visceral—physical entanglement enabling spiritual flight—driven entirely by her agency under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ritual particulars; final image of mortals feeling "cosmic verse" offers resonant answer without moralizing, reweighting nostalgia ban through embodied transcendence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("shadows wove elegant veils," "stars piercing like lighthouses") modulates with ritual intensity; no head-hopping, lyrical compression taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in "obsidian-graced sanctuary" and "iridescent core" slightly dulls momentum, but final image clarity remains uncompromised; no loops or scaffold in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of exile and cosmic transcendence feels inevitable; "fledging" as nebula-winged rootedness transforms trope through specific ritual logic and emotional truth.</comment>
