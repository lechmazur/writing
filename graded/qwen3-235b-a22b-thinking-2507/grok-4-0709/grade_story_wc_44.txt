<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in closure beat; "quietly deliberate" trait shown concretely through micro-choices (steady hand, savoring logic) but interior conflict remains too controlled without visceral doubt/determination tension during shadow confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: "shadows retreated to the Noon Veil" reweights reality's nature with undeniable conceptual cost ("confronting her own shadow, lost in the bending"). Causal lens holds impeccably through loop-closure sequence; cost proof anchored in final confrontation stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Observatory functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: enchanted glass enables rune work, perpetual night permits shadow study. Clockwork key's light directly charges final image ("stepped into the light it cast"), satisfying 9+ gate by charging closure with tool-as-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by protagonist agency: each loop closure narrows options toward Noon Veil revelation. Cost unmistakable in "confronting her own shadow" with visible relational/emotional price. Dominant stake (mending reality) tightens causally without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image (facing shadow in key's light) offers resonant non-literal answer to "where shadows go" without moralizing. Theme emerges through concrete loop mechanics and shadow-as-guardian revelation, avoiding thematic echo; conceptual cost reweights "bent world" premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: scholar's precise observations ("incomplete circles flickering like half-remembered dreams") and rune-focused bias. Rhythmic control modulates perfectly with pressure—clinical during mechanics, poetic during visions—no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythm ("Gears whirred to life" vs flowing vision prose). High density: "luminous paths in the air" implies light/magic. Final line recharges opening motif without figurative muddle; read-aloud propulsion flawless in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: spoon-bending cataclysm grounded in tactile details (spoons twisting like serpents). "Noon Veil" feels inevitable through rune mechanics. Risk-taking heightens stakes via morally ambiguous shadows-as-guardians without gimmickry.</comment>
