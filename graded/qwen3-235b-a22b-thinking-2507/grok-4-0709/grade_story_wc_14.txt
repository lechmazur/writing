<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in "touch without grasping" restraint, but closure choice lacks visible struggle; micro-choices under pressure (charting staccato hum) earn motivation yet final resolve feels untested by flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "silence was no accident" realization reconfigures stakes with felt cost (sharpened motivation amid solitude); accumulative lens holds through humming escalation to dawn's break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Bonsai dewdrops function as micro-setting that constrains choice (refraction timing) and charges closure ("blooms refracting possibilities"); fog-mountain power remains atmospheric rather than physically constraining tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake escalation via Elias' agency: staccato hum directly triggers warning realization, narrowing options to "collect more" with visible cost (solitude transformed into burden); single tightening sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image reweights premise without moralizing: "restrained incandescence of a new day" answers preservation question through refracted possibilities, avoiding thematic echo despite high stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in texture-focused noticing ("velvety nap of explorer's journal"), but "prismatic whispers" edges toward ornamental phrasing in high-pressure beat; rhythm modulates expertly with dawn's urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless density; minor overwriting in "petals refracting first light in prismatic whispers" where "prismatic" slightly muddles refraction mechanics without payoff, avoiding closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stationer-craft with temporal physics avoids tropes; "lamp hum as temporal fracture" transforms collector archetype through specific, grounded mechanics essential to closure.</comment>
