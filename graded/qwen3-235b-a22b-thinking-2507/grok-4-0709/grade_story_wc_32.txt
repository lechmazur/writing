<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction emerges late but earns climax through embodied destruction/renewal cycle; "sensitive soul aching for beauty" avoids label-speak but "hopeless figure" borders on summary early on.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with visceral cost—"shattering it deliberately" charges the final phoenix image; Accumulative lens holds through five approximations tightening options under nexus pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ember nexus constrains every choice (heat softens metal, embers embed veins); "frozen bloom" evolves from fragile beauty to "frost-kissed flowers" charging the final image with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elias' agency—each shattering narrows options toward the curse-as-illusion realization; cost is felt in "liberated souls" fragments but could heighten emotional tradeoffs during third approximation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "creative destruction" mechanics: the crozier's rebirth embodies transcending self-perpetuated curses without moralizing; final image reweights "frozen bloom" as possibility, not desolation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice modulates perfectly under pressure—"embers flared brighter, casting twilight shadows that danced like specters" shows character-particular perception; minor register drift in "vivify" during high-stress beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero closure artifacts but paraphrase loops in "stoically sensitive" repetitions (-0.4); "fragile beauty encased in chill" exemplifies textural specificity, though "charred hope" verges on abstract metaphor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy tropes via "successive approximation" method; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes but "hopeless figure" opening slightly echoes stock melancholy.</comment>
