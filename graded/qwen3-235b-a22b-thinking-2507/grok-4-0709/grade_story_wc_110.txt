<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in Elias' mistrust versus yearning for connection powers the climax, but "frozen isolation" phrasing leans toward therapy-speak abstraction in peak beat, slightly diluting embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with Elias' ice melting and spirit unbound; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through escalating vision density, though the timeframe transition lacks precise causal anchoring.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The projector lens functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (dawn reflection on crystals), but "ruins of forgotten theater" backstory violates BRR by summarizing without altering present tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elias' agency as he decodes each ticket, but the doodles' confession method resolves the mistrust conflict it didn't create, risking coincidence-as-solution under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the crystals' evolving role (isolation to bridge), but explicit "freed by honesty" statement triggers -0.6 thematic echo penalty in final paragraph, undermining earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Elias' rain-soaked sensory focus, but filter verbs ("Elias felt," "he sensed") cluster in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy during the vision sequences.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Overwritten phrases like "shimmering facets like unspoken regrets" clutter high-tension moments; synonym loops ("resonant hush"/"gentle symphony") trigger -0.4 template-cadence penalty in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wordless communication via concert tickets feels inevitable, though the "ethereal visitor" trope slightly diminishes specificity; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
