<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses (caution vs. curiosity) drive choices, but Thorne lacks interiority beyond desperation; final vow renegotiation earns closure though cost feels underweighted on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: renegotiated vow alters future missions with conceptual cost ("eternal secrecy" modified), but botanical diary solution edges toward convenient causality in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bookstore's crystalline veins and "unheard symphony" constrain choices (trap navigation, guardian negotiations) and charge the final image; every detail serves causal pressure without ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via guardian negotiations and illusion traps, but pressure lacks meaningful narrowing—botanical diary resolves conflicts too neatly without compounding costs under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of "errors as wisdom" emerges through Library's holographic orbs and final "music of possibilities" without moralizing; closure reweights premise via conceptual cost of shared secrets.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's perceptual signature ("melodies between letters") shines, but stress-response diction remains overly articulate during negotiations, diluting crisis immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("carefully resourceful," symphony repetitions) and final-paragraph purple prose ("alliances forged in gaps") dull closure's propulsion without breaking coherence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Unlearned Lessons" transforms time-travel tropes through botanical linguistics; risk-taking (chronal lily as loophole) heightens stakes coherently, though library concept echoes familiar mythic chambers.</comment>
