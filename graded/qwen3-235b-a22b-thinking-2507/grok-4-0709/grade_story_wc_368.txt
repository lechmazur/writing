<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("iridescent caution" vs curiosity) is embodied early but lacks micro-choices under pressure; final decision to dye fabrics feels unmotivated by prior causality, missing visible cost for Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Valid Conceptual Repricing closure (reflection redefining identity) has conceptual cost, but "tracking sun trails" lacks causal motivation—tea house mistress' instruction functions as mystical fiat without escalation pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sun trails and morpho wing function as micro-settings charging the final image, but floating rock tea house remains atmospheric backdrop; no spatial choreography constrains Elias' movement or choices during sun-trail tracking.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("why people magnetize stories") is clear but never escalates—zero opposition or tightening; tea house mistress instantly resolves mystery without trade-offs, violating Accumulative pressure requirements for meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through morpho wing/sun trails ("illuminating gently" reweights iridescence), but lacks complexity; no counter-readings or moral calculus, capped by Q4's weak escalation per cross-category rule.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct dye-master perceptual signature ("spectrum of blues," "pigments") shines with rhythmic control, but stress response lacks degradation—Elias processes epiphany with calm articulation ("heart raced, syncing with wing’s shimmer") violating authentic crisis thought.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Overwritten density: "quiet explosion of insight that rippled through the air" (mixed metaphor) and repetitive "iridescent caution" phrasing dull immediacy; final paragraph’s "ready to dye fabrics" uses generic verbs obscuring closure’s emotional charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dye-making and story-magnetism via color metaphors, but "donor heart transferring traits" trope feels derivative (e.g., Me Before You); morpho wing’s iridescence lacks irreplaceable specificity for 8.5+ band.</comment>
