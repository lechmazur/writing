<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear motivation ("find where stories live") and embodied emotion via scarf's sensory details, but lacks contradictory impulses in peak beats; "observed solitude" label risks abstraction without deeper internal conflict manifestation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise ("solitude now laced with connection") with felt cost, but Hybrid lens (Accumulative dominant at closure) isn't fully taught early; orientation anchors at 98 words narrowly avoid penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting (scarf) charges closure via shimmering verses and constrains choice through hyperbolic folding; library's "mirrors and chalkboards" enable the ritual, though scientific poetry feels decorative rather than pressure-driving.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("find story origin") signaled early, but escalation lacks meaningful tightening; knowledge deepens via scarf's response without narrowing options or visible tactical cost beyond emotional transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through scarf's analog reawakening, but final image ("knew she could return") states resolution plainly rather than offering resonant non-literal repricing; avoids moralizing yet lacks conceptual weight shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("equations danced with sonnets") with rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping, though "tactile remembrances digital could never capture" slightly drifts into thematic abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loop in climax ("folded the scarf anew... solitude now laced with connection") and "tactile remembrances" abstraction dull closure beat; otherwise strong density, but artifacts in final third cap high-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hyperbolic geometry with storytelling; specificity of "fractal haikus" and "Einstein's elegies" grounds the premise, but safety-hedging in solitude-to-connection arc avoids bold risk.</comment>
