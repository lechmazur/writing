<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses (fear of failure vs. creative hope) but "orthogonal approaches" feels diagnostic; flaw (business struggles) lacks active complication under pressure despite strong embodied emotion at the brook.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with conceptual cost (safeguarding innovation through unproven seed gamble), but lens ambiguity lingers—seed's origin remains unexplained, weakening causal pressure beneath the accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Brook functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: water's "adapting paths" directly inspires puzzle design, and rain-soaked earth scent charges the final image of creativity "blooming unchecked" with tangible specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safeguarding business) tightens through Elias' realization, but competitors remain abstract threats; cost is conceptual (risking on untested idea) rather than viscerally felt, missing Band 8.8+ escalation requirement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through corpse flower metaphor (creativity as fragile bloom), but final paragraph's explicit "space where innovation flowed eternal" triggers Thematic Echo penalty, replacing earned resonance with moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("water's flow mirrored ebb of thoughts"), but "orthogonal approaches" disrupts lexicon with corporate diction; rhythmic control falters in explanatory ending where syntax becomes uniform.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density ("vein-like patterns," "scent of rain-soaked earth"), but "pulsing with unspoken potential" is cliché; minor figurative muddle in peak beats prevents 9.0 despite strong propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms escape room trope through corpse flower's macabre scent mechanics, but business struggle resolution lacks risk—competitors evaporate via epiphany rather than hard-won innovation with genuine stakes.</comment>
