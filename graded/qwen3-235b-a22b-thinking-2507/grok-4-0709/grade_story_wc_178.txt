<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (science vs. mysticism) drive every choice; "thrifty heart racing" embodies cost without labels. Final covenant vow earns closure through established frugality-as-devotion. Slight abstraction in "encrypted devotion" phrasing barely tempers otherwise concrete interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost: "frugal astronomer's quiet triumph" crystallizes eternal binding after ritual endurance. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—sensory density builds to portal's appearance. No causality breaks; "thrifty heart racing" proves cost legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Recycled papyrus and thrifted vial constrain ritual tactics, charging the final image ("tile forever marked"). Sensory details filtered through astronomer's POV ("harmonious dusk where light and dark intertwined"). Micro-setting elevates beyond backdrop by shaping scarcity-driven devotion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through ritual escalation: tile's hum → portal → sages' judgment, all driven by Elias' agency. Cost is unmistakable in "thrifty heart racing" and eternal covenant weight. Dominant stake ("seal covenant with unknown") crystallizes through frugality-as-devotion tradeoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: coded prayer as calculations, charcoal schematics. Final image ("devotion... bound him to stars eternally") resonates without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality by grounding "encrypted devotion" in frugal material choices.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: astronomer notices "harmonious dusk" as light/dark balance. Rhythm shifts with pressure—lyrical during ritual, staccato at "Elias gasped." Minor register drift in "empirically ironic" slightly undermines interiority under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "dwindled like fading constellations" compresses backstory with momentum. Strategic telling avoids summarizing pivotal beats. Borderline purple prose in "shimmering rift where empirical data twisted" risks muddling but saved by context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: Babylonian astronomer's frugality as sacred conduit. Transforms "between regimes" trope into spiritual liminality. Magic square redefines mathematical object as mystical tool. Emotional truth in science-meets-faith tension avoids binary clichés.</comment>
