<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "quiet triumph" vs. mortality dread is strong, but "lucidly watchful" remains labeled rather than embodied through micro-choices during Thorne's final exhale; Thorne's absence as active character limits relationship crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise via Elara's "how many more" question against the glowing chip—conceptual cost of her own mortality is undeniable—but mid-scene explanation of her "method" slightly breaks Accumulative lens by stating mechanics instead of deepening texture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Skyborne grotto’s aurora-light "pooling like liquid hush" actively enables the ritual’s climax; emerald chip (micro-setting) constrains choice by requiring pattern-infusion to capture essence, charging the final image where it "danced across its surface."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten as Thorne’s breath fades, narrowing options to the emerald infusion; cost is visceral in Elara’s "quiet triumph" undercut by her mortality awareness ("how many more could she save?"), fulfilling Accumulative escalation through density increase.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image of the chip’s "miniature cosmos" offers resonant non-literal answer to "defying void," reweighting "thresholds" theme through aurora-reflected patterns—no moralizing, pure earned subtext via particulars like "fractal beauty of autumn leaves."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "prismatic light through grotto’s arches" filtered through Elara’s trade—auroras aren’t described but felt as "radiant hush" that "pools"; rhythm shifts from lyrical to staccato during Thorne’s fading breaths.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "static within Thorne" slightly abstracts physical sensation but avoids therapy-speak; every line advances texture (e.g., "brushes of feather-soft crystal" implying tool constraint), with final line’s "lucid watch" crystallizing momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "memento mori" via skyborne grotto’s aurora-infused ritual—specificity of "comet shard" and "starfern shrouds" creates fresh synthesis; risk-taking in quiet closure lands without gimmickry.</comment>
