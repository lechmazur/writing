<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "strangely honest" trait remains label-only without tradeoffs. Motivation clear but embodied emotion sparse beyond "burned quietly." Micro-choices under pressure absent despite ritual execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visible cost (fading clearings, solitude), but orientation anchors delayed past 120 words. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density shift, though causality in consecration feels under-pressured.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting (half-mask, kinetic parapet) constrains choice and charges final image. Sensory details evolve causally with conjured clearings' shimmer and parapet's rhythmic stones, avoiding white-room syndrome through tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wisdom echoes) lacks concrete escalation; pressure grows texturally but without narrowing options. Cost legible in fading clearings yet remains abstract—no visceral forfeiture beyond atmospheric loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through kinetic parapet's transformation, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "echoes" as enduring resonance, though "preserve wisdom" premise risks abstraction without sharper ethical calculus in ritual act.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "peripheral awareness" observations, with rhythmic control during consecration. No head-hopping, but tense/stability falters slightly in prophet's off-page influence on parapet.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, though "starlit robes igniting faint sparks" overwrites early beat. Final paragraph's "conjured clearings fading" delivers propulsion, but template cadence ("Elar stepped... Elar knelt...") appears mid-scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of desert mysticism with "kinetic parapet" mechanics avoids trope repetition. Risk-taking in accumulative structure succeeds, though "whisperfield calm" proximity to familiar lyric fantasy slightly limits novelty.</comment>
