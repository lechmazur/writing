<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's combative tenderness manifests through contradictory impulses: jabbing at "shattered" weakness while tracing resilience in tea leaves. Kael's involuntary backward pacing mirrors her habit, showing organic absorption of her methods. Final quiet endurance ("resilience bloomed quietly") forecloses retreat with felt cost. Slight under-dramatization of Kael's rebellion backstory prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Kael's quiet confrontation ("whispered vows of strength") crystallizes options with conceptual cost ("resilience bloomed"). Accumulative lens holds—tea leaves/shadow geometry reweight "reversible exile" through patterned recurrence. Cost legible in "bumping into bookshelf" physicalizing internal shift. Minor escalation dip at portal arrival prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (tea leaves) constrains choice: Kael must "leave the dregs" for Elara's reading, their geometry dictating his path ("pentagon of persistence"). Playground swing's motion tightens temporal pressure, bookending the scene. Final shard-archiving charges closure by embodying "quiet work enduring." Library spatial vagueness prevents 9.5.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reversing exile through resilience) tightens when Elara forces Kael to "tame your shadow," narrowing options to confrontation. Cost is felt in "resilience bloomed quietly within him"—endurance over triumph. Agency driven by Kael's micro-choices (complying with tea, analyzing leaves). "Reversible exile" mechanism lacks concrete failure consequences.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "pentagon of persistence" reweights resilience as quiet endurance, not victory. Final image ("archiving the moment in a new shard-mirror") offers non-literal answer to "reversible exile" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; cost is conceptual (fragile reversal thread). Near-allegory edge prevents 9.5.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's voice carries distinct lexicon ("Foolish boy," "tame your shadow") contrasting Kael's terse defiance. Rhythmic compression under stress ("Kael leaned in, intrigued despite himself") shows control. Minor POV slippage in "defiance warring with curiosity" momentarily breaks focalization. No dialogue convergence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "triangles of betrayal, circles of potential return" demonstrates high density without muddle. Final line ("quiet work enduring in the forgotten library's eternal hush") recharges opening dust motes with earned weight. Near-synonym repetition of "reversible exile" in one paragraph costs 0.1. Propulsion flawless under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms mentor tropes through specific mechanisms: tea-leaf geometry as resilience metric, shadow-in-glass as reversible exile metaphor. "Shard-mirror archivist" premise avoids derivativeness via lived detail (porcelain cup, ledger annotations). Playground swing motif edges toward familiar symbolism but earns freshness through causal pressure on pacing.</comment>
