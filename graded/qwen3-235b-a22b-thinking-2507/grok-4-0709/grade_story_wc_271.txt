<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (grief vs. hope) embodied through micro-choices like clutching photo while tending plants; "somatic markers" borders clinical but offset by visceral paralysis during rumble.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: pocketing pearl beside photo crystallizes reconfigured hope with felt cost (grief still "burns"); fog lifting as sun pierces canopy reweights stakes under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Arboretum micro-setting constrains choice—oyster plant's pearl literally charges final image; salt-wind resistance shapes Elias' "symphony of blooms" tactics; no ornamental detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</comment><question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake "will trauma consume him?" tightens through somatic freeze to pearl-plucking; cost is ongoing grief (photo burns) but visible shift to grounded optimism; agency drives escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through arboretum's "pearl of stillness" reweighted from plant feature to emotional anchor; final image ("optimism felt grounded") resonates without moralizing; no thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: botanical precision ("oyster plant's leaves shimmering like hidden treasures") merges with trauma responses; syntax tightens under stress ("He froze, the action involuntary").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Crumpled photograph" repetition creates minor synonym loop in high-pressure beat; otherwise clean propulsion—final line "ready to face whatever came next" slightly generic after lyrical prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms PTSD tropes via arboretum specificity; "pearl of stillness" concept feels inevitable in hindsight; avoids safety middle through quiet endurance over dramatic recovery.</comment>
