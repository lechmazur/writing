<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in questioning assumptions ("why assume connection is loud?"), but "powerfully gentle" label repeats without deeper embodiment; micro-choices under pressure reveal values via bell selections.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: cracked lamp lens channels final propel, revealing "golden shadow" connection with felt cost; Accumulative lens holds through questioning beats that narrow options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lab setting constrains choices (grid stability required for pilgrimage); miner's lamp lens evolves from tool to cost-bearing object, charging the final image with its scarred refraction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through three layered questions that alter propulsion velocity; cost crystallizes in the lens cracking under thematic pressure, narrowing Elara's path to rediscovered harmonies.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sound interrogation ("velvety echo, resilient yet fragile"), avoiding moralizing; final image of lingering golden shadows reweights connection without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in light-sound synesthesia ("bells split light into rainbows of sound"); controlled rhythm shifts during questioning beats, though "powerfully gentle" repetition slightly flattens voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in opening ("echoes lingered like ghosts") distracts, but propulsion accelerates in climax; no closure-dulling loops, though "powerfully gentle" appears 3x without variation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic pilgrimage with lab science feels inevitable; "questioning assumptions" mechanic transforms trope through specific light-refraction physics and emotional stakes.</comment>
