<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction weak; prism-minded trait informs evasion tactics but lacks emotional stakes beyond triumph. "Latent blaze" abstraction dilutes embodied fear during tendril attack.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong Charged Poise closure with gravity normalization cost, but "threshold effects" mechanics arrive late without early signal. Inversion rules established sufficiently for single-turn escalation under Hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Serpentine grotto constrains navigation via inverted drips and wall-tendril proximity, charging final orb grab. Over-reliance on visual "mist" cliché slightly dilutes specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unearth combinations) tightens via time pressure and tendril confrontation. Cost legible in near-miss escape, but "seeds of vigilance" threat lacks mid-scene escalation beyond final attack.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Thematic echo in final line ("power to refract the world's hidden lights anew") replaces earned resonance with prompt-like abstraction. Core concept of "seeds" never interrogates vigilance's moral cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("refracting like light") sustains under pressure, but "latent blaze" repetition flattens emotional modulation. No head-hopping; psychic distance consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Template cadence ("her motivation burning... latent blaze simmering") and metaphor clash ("latent blaze ignite") in high-pressure beats. Final paragraph's "clandestinely luminous" repetition triggers paraphrase loop.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prism cognition with cartography elevates trope. But gravity inversion as plot device lacks distinctive rules; feels swappable with "time portal" without narrative impact.</comment>
