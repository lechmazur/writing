<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction weak; "blessed pariah" status stated not shown through simultaneous contradictory impulses. Final choice to explore logs lacks earned causality from prior struggle—flaws don’t compound organically. Motivation remains abstract "confusion into exploration" without visible micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to Charged Poise closure where silence transforms from oppressive to companionable. Cost proof fails—no exact sentence/image showing legible cost (e.g., "warm against her chest" implies gain, not sacrifice). Orientation clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting details vivid but don’t constrain choice: time dilation enables discovery passively ("distorted constellations shimmered") without forcing tradeoffs. Compass rose charges final image but lacks mid-scene tactical constraint (e.g., no struggle aligning it mid-sketch). Misses 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early (isolation vs. meaning), pressure tightens via sensory accumulation toward nebula reveal. But escalation lacks protagonist agency—the "glimpse" stems from accidental adjustment ("adjusted her position"), not deliberate choice. Cost felt but not visible; no concrete forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly through action: "true north" evolves from physical direction to inner purpose via sketching→discovery. Final image reweights "confusion" as "canvas of possibility" without moralizing. But "confusion into exploration" motivation remains told, not shown through conflicted choices.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: time dilation refracts sensory input ("stretched moments like elongated threads"). Rhythm modulates perfectly with pressure—long sentences during sketching, clipped phrases at "glimpse." Zero head-hopping; all details filtered through temporal sensitivity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose propulsion flawless: "flickering holograms, frozen in the aftermath" compresses backstory without scaffold. Minor density hit—"confusion started to morph into exploration" uses weak "morph" verb, muddying high-pressure beat. No loops or artifacts in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of space opera tropes through sensory specificity (time dilation as "heartbeat from another era"). But "blessed pariah" archetype lacks transformation—no specific detail makes her isolation feel newly lived. Emotional truth strong but premise derivative.</comment>
