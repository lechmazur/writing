<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion in smudging action reveals hierarchy of values, but tears resolve too neatly; "bitter herb" metaphor edges toward stock phrasing without sufficient character-specific distortion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost ("exhaled, lighter now"), but botanical illustration's sudden introduction lacks causal anchoring; fever break timeframe doesn't tighten temporal pressure despite stated stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting of botanical illustration constrains choice and charges final image, yet mountain station remains atmospheric backdrop; altitude sickness affects early perception but fails to alter later tactics beyond metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elara's agency in smudging, but escalation lacks contested struggle—no moment where she nearly abandons the margins method, weakening pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete image transformation (petals to hidden scale), but "swaying certainties" is overtly stated early, slightly diluting subtextual resonance at climax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in margin-focused noticing, though peak-stress prose maintains uniform lyricism without the compression expected during truth-reckoning.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless rhythm and density, but "morning's reluctant gray" anthropomorphizes weakly; no loops or scaffold, and final line ("dawn's fading light") powerfully recharges opening aurora.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "buried secret" trope through alpine-specific botanical scale; risk-taking in conceptual closure (truth's weight as auroral sorrow) feels inevitable yet fresh without gimmickry.</comment>
