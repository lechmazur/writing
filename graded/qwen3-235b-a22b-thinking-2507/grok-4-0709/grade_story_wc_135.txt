<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's "reactively visionary" trait avoids label-speak through embodied actions like clutching the valve as visions surge; her motivation to compile fragments into meaning drives all choices without over-tidiness, though contradictory impulses in the final closure beat lack sufficient layering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation Test fails (142 words to establish setting), triggering -0.4 penalty; Accumulative/Textural lens holds with effective Charged Poise closure where "people no longer adrift but anchored" conveys conceptual cost of exile transformed into collective purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setting functions as postcard backdrop until the trumpet valve appears; rain-slicked docks create minor physical constraints ("boots splashing"), but the ivory harbor's bone spires don't constrain choices or charge the final image despite vivid description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elara's staggered revelations as pressure tightens; each interval narrows emotional options ("allowing reflection without overwhelm"), but the cost of exile remains abstractly felt rather than viscerally demonstrated in key beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "navigated absences" becoming "compiled truths," avoiding moralizing; the final image of humming harbor reweights exile's void into collective anchoring without stating a moral, though secondary stakes lack development.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "salt mist-whispers" and "puddles mirroring ships"; rhythmic control intensifies during vision sequences ("clutched the valve tighter, her mind racing"), though minor psychic distance slippage occurs in group reactions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "tarnished brass piece, curved and intricate" with concrete propulsion, though "weariness of absence" slightly overwrites emotional specificity in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Ocean-spray archivist" transforms exile tropes through specific sensory work, but "reactively visionary" feels conceptually familiar; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though emotional arc lacks radical novelty.</comment>
