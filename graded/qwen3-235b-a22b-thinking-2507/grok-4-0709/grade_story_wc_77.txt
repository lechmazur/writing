<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion ("chest ached from defibrillator's bite") but internal conflict lacks layered contradiction; confession scenes feel too linear without simultaneous resistance. Final endurance earns change but micro-choices lack hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: fear's unraveling reweights "exposure starves it" with visible cost in "resuscitated not just in body, but in spirit." Minor causality slip—advisor's unmotivated appearance—avoids major penalty under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Funhouse setting constrains choices (mirrors force confession, luminance enables fear's defeat) and charges final image ("conquered whisper"). Sensory specificity ("rotting fabrics like flayed skin") elevates without cliché, though spatial choreography occasionally vague near climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via paradox density ("Silence screams loudest" → confession → fear's approach) with visible cost in self-revelation. Agency-driven deepening works, but tightening lacks one tangible forfeiture (e.g., physical toll beyond chest ache) to reach 8.8+ band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through luminance motif: final image ("carnival's echoes a distant, conquered whisper") reweights abandonment fear without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality via concrete struggle, though "resuscitated in spirit" edges close to abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("pallid gaze," "repulsive allure" refracted through Elias' dread) with rhythmic control. Minor register drift in "unbosom" (clinical vs. visceral context) but compression taught early via dream dictionary paradoxes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density falters in peak beats: "repulsive allure" repeats verbatim (loop -0.3), and "lingering luminance" lacks evolution. Otherwise vivid propulsion ("distorting his reflection into grotesque, alluring shapes") with no closure-dulling artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carnival liminality and psychological confrontation; "lingering luminance" transforms fear mechanics beyond trope. Risks lyrical abstraction but anchors in concrete stakes ("photographed clasp revealing soul-wounds"). Avoids derivative safety middle.</comment>
