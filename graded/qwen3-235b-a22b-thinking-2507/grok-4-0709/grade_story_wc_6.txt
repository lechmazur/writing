<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in repurposing father's coin as scarred tool, but "unyielding compassion" drifts toward label-speak in peak beats, risking the 9+ gate despite strong embodied scars.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the singing sapling crystallizes options with undeniable cost in "her own scars warmed by the setting sun," fulfilling Accumulative lens requirements without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon and black sand constrain choices (using volcanic minerals for grafting) and charge the final image; micro-setting functions as environmental crucible with purposeful sensory selectivity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through ritual precision under cloud migration pressure, but escalation lacks visible price paid during the grafting beat—cost emerges only at closure, missing a mid-scene trade-off for higher bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete grafting actions without moralizing; final image reweights "scars can sing" as resonant non-literal answer, avoiding thematic echo despite near-miss in closing line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("kelp-drift peace," cloud migrations as nomadic herds") modulates under pressure, but "gracefully alert" repetition creates subtle voice convergence in high-stakes moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "gracefully alert" repetitions and borderline label-speak ("unyielding compassion") dull immediacy in two beats; no closure artifacts but density slightly overloads in ritual description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of firefighter/arsonist legacy through volcanic grafting ritual feels inevitable; risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry or abstraction.</comment>
