<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (idealism vs dread) shown via journal decoding under pressure, but "dread pooling like rainwater" uses diagnostic label-speak. Final choice earned but cost remains abstract despite station endangerment stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance with visible cost (sailing into storm), but jet stream lull timing feels coincidental. Lens holds as Causal, yet cost proof lacks concrete on-page consequence like damaged equipment or isolation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Humidity-warped maps and spongey dread constrain choices (peeling fragile journals, squelching floors), with copper nail charging final image. Verdigris surface and coffin relic specificity elevates micro-setting beyond atmospheric decoration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reversing exile) tightens through journal decoding, but decoding succeeds too easily without earned reversal. Cost remains conceptual (doubt) rather than felt consequence; station endangerment mentioned but not dramatized as tactical constraint.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of inherited rage resolves through final image (nail gleaming amid mist), reweighting "reversible exile" as emotional calm rather than legalistic victory. Avoids moralizing while connecting ancestral weight to storm patterns without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in map-centric observations ("charts whispering lost worlds"), but "nervously confident" recurs with mechanical cadence. Voice modulates effectively under decoding pressure though dread descriptors verge on overwriting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity ("barnacles, bloated pages") but "spongey dread" loops 5x with diminishing returns. Final paragraph's "rain pelted like insistent fingers" risks mixed metaphor; density muddles cost legibility in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of maritime law with weather science avoids tropes, but "reversible exile" concept leans on convenient ritual. Bold risk in atmospheric pressure as antagonist, though jet stream mechanics feel underdeveloped for scientific setting.</comment>
