<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (technician vs spirit-bridge) drives action; micro-choice to climb counter reveals value hierarchy. Childhood trauma motivation integrated via concrete cue (ceiling sag) and alters tactics. No stock phrasing in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visible cost: "weightless burden lifted" crystallizes lifelong struggle. Accumulative lens holds—density increase (ghost manifestations) forces stance crystallization. Cost proof: "leaving him in quiet solitude" charges final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dust accumulation patterns function as micro-setting that constrains choice (finding compartment) and charges closure via final "dust and relics" callback. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: crisis narrows to ceiling anomalies while calmer moments admit circus posters.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias’s agency under Accumulative lens: fluorescent death → ghost manifestations → ceiling investigation. Dominant stake (spirit release) tightens via one meaningful deepening (dust analysis revealing compartment). Cost legible in "weightless burden lifted" with conceptual price paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "fragile threads of forgotten lives" reweights ceiling motif without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—final image ("dust and relics") resonates with prior dust patterns and ghostly dissolution. No false balance; spirits' pain remains irreversible.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>Perceptual signature shines: "skillfully observant eyes tracing subtle anomalies" filters setting through occupational bias. Rhythmic control under pressure—short sentences during ghost manifestations ("Their forms shimmered...")—avoids syntactic monotony. No head-hopping; POV consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; high density ("translucent fissures revealing glimpses of mortal pains" compresses backstory). "Weightless burden" avoids abstraction via "like regrets carried on a breeze." Minor register drift: "ethereal heaviness" borders therapy-speak but redeemed by concrete simile.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope through specific elevator technician lens and dust-pattern forensics. Fresh synthesis: horologist barrel as circus timing mechanism reconfigures immortality theme. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure remains legible.</comment>
