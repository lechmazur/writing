<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied ("spirit curling like dried petals") but abstract labels like "blooming hope against withering doubt" verge on therapy-speak, weakening motivation during pivotal trust escalation with Aria.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("tears bloomed... withering fear giving way to renewal") under Accumulative lens, though meteorite's "alien glow" infusion edges toward convenient resolution rather than earned causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Attic setting vividly rendered with sensory specificity, but micro-setting (skylight/dust motes) only partially constrains choices—mapping ritual lacks tangible pressure on decisions despite charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes (trust vs isolation) escalate credibly through Aria's training, but pigeon's return with reconciliation borders on coincidence resolving conflict rather than protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, diluting cost legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through paper trails and dust motes; final line reweights "blooming, withering cycle of trust" without moralizing, offering resonant non-literal answer to central question via concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust motes danced... echoing chaos of his heart") with rhythmic control under pressure; minor register drift in "reinvented personal history" slightly disrupts voice coherence during reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong propulsion and specificity marred by paraphrase loops ("isolation had bloomed... spirit curling like dried petals") and template cadence in mapping sequences, though closure beat remains artifact-free.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic imagery with pigeon courier trope; meteorite chip avoids cliché through "iridescent" specificity, though "fragile leaves of trust" leans toward stock metaphor despite contextual integration.</comment>
