<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority excels with embodied contradictions ("mind a whirlwind of calm intensity"), but ghost mentor lacks sufficient opposition to test Elias' resolve; final choice feels earned though micro-choices under pressure could deepen.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with visible cost ("forever changed" + ribbon gathering), but ghost's convenient wisdom slightly undermines causal pressure; lens holds as Accumulative/Textural with migration patterns reweighting grief's form.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse functions as micro-setting charging closure: vines constrain movement, butterflies physically interact with ribbon, and marble slab becomes canvas—environment directly shapes Elias' final carving choice under dusk's pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through ribbon retracing (Elias' agency tightens options), but ghost's guidance resolves tension too neatly; migration's "thundering calm" raises cost legibly though pressure lacks organic opposition beyond Elias' internal doubt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through woven ribbon/butterfly patterns reconfiguring grief as collective tapestry; avoids moralizing despite mentor's "Trade your poems" line by embedding insight in physical action (carving swirls) not abstract statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines: "vines twisted like forgotten promises" filters setting through Elias' craft; rhythmic control intensifies during retracing ("steps deliberate and meditative") with no head-hopping despite spectral presence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Thundering calm" repetition (4x) risks scaffold loop but earns resonance through evolving context; near-miss with "serene frenzy" metaphor yet closure lines ("woven, poetic storm") achieve crystalline propulsion without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief rituals with butterfly migration transforms tropes; "collective grief as woven storm" feels inevitable through prior particulars (ribbon, poetry exchanges), avoiding generic symbolism via tactile specificity.</comment>
