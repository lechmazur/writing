<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete ("mind a labyrinth of reflections") and motivation rooted in specific error, but Mira/Thorne lack depth. Micro-choices like drawer-pull untethering reveal hierarchy of values, though emotional progression toward absolution feels slightly tidy despite visible cost of regret.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "first stir of absolution" crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost ("weight of old mistakes recycled into wisdom"). Causal lens holds throughout; moon-phase synchronization creates meaningful tightening without soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Parapet and drawer pull function as micro-setting that constrains choice (ritual untethering) and charges final image ("mist swirled... carrying away weight"). Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's urgency: salt/decay scents noted, visual details minimized during high-pressure exchange.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias's agency: his moon-phase study and drawer-pull ritual narrow options toward flawless exchange. Cost ("months of regret") is legible in final ritual, though external clan tension lacks visceral escalation beyond "palpable yet contained" moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through drawer-pull ritual: "true untethering came not from the object, but from the thoughtful heart" reweights premise without moralizing. Final image charges closure by transforming "recycle mistake into wisdom" from abstraction to embodied cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices textures (brass warmth, rope friction) not scenery. Rhythmic control under pressure evident in clipped phrases during exchange ("Elias raised his hand... voice low and measured"), though "hushed resolve" edges toward therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor synonym loops ("recycled his mistake into wisdom"/"recycled now into wisdom") and slight overwriting in reflection blocks. No closure-dulling artifacts; final line's "enduring hush" achieves textural specificity with zero scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms prisoner-exchange trope through specific ritual (drawer-pull untethering) and focus on quiet redemption. Avoids clichés via concrete stakes (rope-sliding friction, moon-phase astronomy), though "neutral territory" remains conventional fantasy framing.</comment>
