<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via embodied skepticism (glowing skin vs doubt) and micro-choices (taste shifts guiding steps), but carrier's explanation resolves internal conflict too neatly without sufficient struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost ("skepticism softened"), and causal lens holds through ring activation to convergence, though the ring's sudden efficacy slightly strains causality at the climax beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tin compass ring constrains choice (taste-guided navigation) and charges the final image (nascent weather emerging), while aurora-lavender bluff setting actively shapes tactics through sensory pressure during convergence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding weather-carriers) tightens meaningfully through ring-guided pursuit, but the carrier's thematic explanation resolves conflict without sufficient protagonist-driven escalation or tangible cost beyond softened skepticism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of "nostalgia for chaos" emerges organically through the carrier's dialogue and Elara's realization, avoiding moralizing; final image ("tasting the future's sweet complexity") offers resonant non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bitter like overripe herbs" to "starry tang") modulates with pressure, and rhythmic control ("winds howled nostalgically, like old vinyl records") pays off taught lyric compression without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops and high density ("cosmic dust mixed with earthly honey"), but minor overwriting in high-pressure beats ("bioluminescent polls lighting up like ancient fireworks") slightly dulls immediacy near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Specific synthesis of "terrestrially cosmic" and weather-carriers feels inevitable; risk-taking (taste-based navigation) heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming template quests through lived detail and non-obvious emotional calculus.</comment>
