<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority richly embodied through tapping rhythms and coral memory, but early motivation lacks sufficient contradictory impulses; father's confession deepens flaws yet feels slightly convenient without prior hints of inherited guilt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully with father's coordinates and confession, reweighting "disappearing paths" through acidified waters; cost legible in Elara's tears and "drifting moored vigil," though atlas discovery edges toward convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Driftmoor Station functions as micro-setting: solar pods and bioluminescent panels constrain choices, while the atlas page's physicality (frayed edges, faint indentations) charges the final image of tapping affirmation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's agency as she decodes the atlas via rhythmic tapping, with the "periodically eternal" attribute enabling the method; cost crystallizes in her father's complicity, though revelation timing slightly over-optimizes pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from submerged paths as metaphor for buried truth, culminating in the non-literal answer: paths "rerouted by acidified waters" mirroring moral rerouting; avoids moralizing but "periodically eternal" phrasing risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in oceanic rhythms and tactile atlas handling; rhythmic control intensifies during decoding ("tapping evolving into a method"), though late storm description slightly disrupts spatial coherence of the pod.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("rain pelted the pod's dome, Elara rummaged"), but minor scaffold in "memories etched with ghostly white skeletons" slightly dulls immediacy; no closure-impacting artifacts despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of climate grief and Morse-code discovery transforms tropes; "periodically eternal" redefines cyclical time as active constraint, with atlas page's tactile decryption avoiding derivative solutions through character-specific rhythm practice.</comment>
