<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (analytic grief vs. emotional surrender) earned through snow globe's physical unraveling; no therapy-speak in peak beats. Clara's death knotted tighter with every dive shows embodied, flawed struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with felt cost: "letting go was not erasure, but equilibrium" reweights physics metaphor through snow globe's final ascent. Accumulative lens holds—pressure tightens via thread-untangling sequence narrowing options to surrender.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting (snow globe) charges closure: miniature biplane's snowfall becomes embodied metaphor for grief's physics. Library's "warped shelves" and submersible cockpit constrain choices—robotic arms enable thread-untangling method under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via Elias's agency: each untangled thread narrows options toward surrender. Cost crystallizes in "knotting tighter with every dive" realization—visible trade-off where physics analysis yields to emotional release under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: snow globe's artificial snow parallels grief's "particles clinging, then drifting apart." Final image ("echoes teach us to drift free") reweights "physics of letting go" without moralizing—no thematic echo in closing line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "quietly analytic" voice filters library as "cathedral of forgotten knowledge," submerging emotion in physics metaphors until the note shatters composure. Rhythmic control peaks in "flakes settled only after chaos" realization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-loop in "quietly analytic" repetition (paragraphs 2/4) costs 0.2; otherwise high density with zero figurative muddle. "Hypnotic dance" avoids therapy-speak by tying to "turbulence" physics. Final line’s cadence shift ("drift free") propels closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sunken ship library as crucible for grief physics transforms Earhart trope. Emotional specificity in "knotting regrets tighter with every dive" avoids generic templates. Risk-taking (espionage threads in snow globe) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
