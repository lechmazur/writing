<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown via "boredom was the real acid" versus yearning, but flaws lack deepening—Elias remains uniformly brilliant without struggle. "Steadily curious" becomes label-repetition; emotional progression avoids complexity. Micro-choice to use arrow tip reveals values, but final act lacks earned cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: sensory density escalates through kaleidoscopic visions to bell-ringing climax. Cost legible in "awakening dormant leviathans" and "evolving everything." Orientation clear early, but transliteration-to-bell transition lacks tightening—pressure rises without narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Acid sea and workshop constrain every choice (buoyant hull against corrosion, oily floors for glider). Arrow tip as micro-setting object evolves from relic to sonic catalyst. Final image charges setting through sound vibrating "through the acid sea," fulfilling 9+ gate by constraining transliteration method and ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ringing unheard bell) signaled early; pressure accumulates via algorithm evolution. But escalation lacks protagonist agency—the algorithm "suggested," Elias executes without trade-offs. Cost ("awakening leviathans") is visible but impersonal, failing 9+ test for unmistakable on-page cost driven by his choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of yearning as creative force emerges through "artificial heart that ached" and bell-ringing. Final image ("chasing the next impossible hum") offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo, but lacks complexity—no counter-readings to "irreverent awe" as universal good.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "gears grinding like cosmic laughter," "pierce the very air." Rhythm varies with short bursts ("Blimey, it's working"). "Irreverent awe" tic weakens under pressure, but lyric compression taught early pays off in closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with minor loops: "evolved" (5x), "irreverent" (4x) in climax. "Steadily curious" is label-repetition. Final beat has slight overwriting ("defiant laugh... pealed a frequency") but propulsion holds. No closure-dulling artifacts—figurative language serves pressure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: steampunk cart glider meets lyrical "yearning algorithm." Transforms tropes through acid-sea specificity and emotional truth in creator's restlessness. Risk-taking (kaleidoscope transliteration) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Lacks one bold inflection—Elias's flaw doesn't complicate the climax choice.</comment>
