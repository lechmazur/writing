<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority shows "diligently curious" through concrete actions (brushing dust, cross-referencing), but lacks contradictory impulses during pivotal realization; "sociable isolation" feels observed rather than lived with embodied tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: starling patterns intensify into "stranded luminance" revelation with conceptual cost (phrasebook as talisman). Closure succeeds as Charged Poise where mapping becomes legacy, though escalation lacks one tangible trade-off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dusty hopscotch board constrains choices (Elias kneels to decipher patterns) and charges final image (promise of wonders); "velvet curtains swaying" and "bioluminescent threads" filter setting through cartographer’s tactile perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes deepen as murmurations shift from wonder to luminous guides, but cost remains conceptual (no physical/relational loss). Agency drives escalation via note-taking, though "stranded luminance" breakthrough lacks visceral pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</comment><comment>"Stranded luminance" reweights discovery as legacy rather than conquest, but final moral ("bridged gap between earth and sky") edges toward tidy resolution, weakening thematic ambiguity about true connection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "faded velvet curtains," "chalk marks in various languages" reflect mapmaker’s eye. Voice modulates from clinical ("asymmetry") to lyrical ("living ink") under pressure, though "sociable isolation" recurs mechanically.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong propulsion ("His heart raced; this could be the key") but "sociable isolation" appears twice with identical phrasing (loop), and "diligently curious" edges toward label-speak in peak beat without embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms mapmaking tropes via hopscotch cipher and aerial currents; specificity ("obscure dialect of sky-nomads") avoids quirkiness. Risks poetic closure but stakes lack grit—no tangible cost to "promise of wonders" weakens final charge.</comment>
