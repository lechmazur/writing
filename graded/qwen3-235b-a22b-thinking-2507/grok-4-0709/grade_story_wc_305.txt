<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction lacking; "kindly decisive" demonstrated via scalloping veils but no simultaneous conflicting impulses under pressure during Lir's crisis. Motivation clear yet emotional progression over-tidy with no irrational layering beyond stated regret/forgiveness framework.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase at ritual beat; closure as Charged Poise ("contentment's source revealed itself") carries conceptual cost through Lir's renewal, but cost legibility weakened by absence of specific sacrifice—Elara's prior forgiveness lacks present-tense stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Umbral grotto functions as micro-setting: luminous fungi constrain choices (veil-scalloping sparks), while hairpin's wave-shaped prongs charge final image. Sensory hierarchy masterful—"vineyard hush" evolves from backdrop to tactile pressure during ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (contentment's source) tightens via ritual escalation, but pressure lacks protagonist-driven agency; Lir's erratic aura complicates yet resolution stems from Elara's pre-established realization rather than in-scene adaptation. Cost felt yet not visibly paid by Elara.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Thematic echo in final paragraph ("She had forgiven, climbed...") states thesis explicitly, violating organic emergence. Theme resists binaries but closure moralizing ("found contentment in the cycle's gentle turn") undercuts earned resonance with near-platitudinal delivery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("veins of luminous fungi mimicked starlight") persists under pressure; rhythmic control shines in ritual sequence. Minor tense drift in reflection ("how releasing that pain had sparked") slightly disrupts immediacy during tree-climbing beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; "vineyard hush" recurrence earns purposeful density. Slight overwriting in "soft rustle of leaves that glowed faintly... hush broken only by soft snip of silk" risks paraphrase loop but saved by semantic shift from observation to ritual action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Transforms rebirth trope through grotto-specific mechanics (scallop veils mirroring hairpin waves). Fresh inflection in contentment-as-caregiving insight, though derivative premise guardrail caps score—core arc echoes common forgiveness-to-purpose narratives without sufficient moral complexity.</comment>
