<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices: trembling hands after shows versus carving bravery, with the final smile as earned endurance. Micro-choice of pressing chisel to wood crystallizes her shift from passive grief to active containment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: the half-formed lion's watchful eyes and "harvested, held" reconfiguration reweight impermanence through felt stakes. Accumulative lens holds from "here and gone" refrain to final rain-bead imagery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ash wood carving blank constrains every choice—its grain dictates cuts, its "ghost" charges the final image. Rain-beaded skylight evolves from setting to active metaphor, with heavier drops mirroring unraveled thoughts during pivotal carving.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through carving agency: each stroke (mane, eyes, paw) tightens the "contain grief" method under Accumulative pressure. Cost crystallizes in her realization that resilience mirrors ash wood's strength, though the "here and gone" concept lacks mid-scene testing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through wood-grain particulars: "harvesting peace from pain" avoids moralizing via the carved lion's weary eyes and preserved raindrops. Final image reweights impermanence as "harvested, held"—resonant without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "earthly nostalgia" of ash shavings and "rust-hued peace" lexicon. Rhythmic control under pressure: short sentences during carving ("First lesson: bravery...") contrast lyrical rain descriptions, with all elisions taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "jeweled skylight like tears frozen in descent" risks purple prose but pays off in closure's "preserved moments." Near-repetition of "here and gone" in final paragraph slightly dulls momentum despite thematic purpose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes through woodcarver's specificity: "hauntingly practical" ash wood and "crystallized time" method feel inevitable. Emotional truth in her harvesting peace—not overcoming loss—avoids sentimental safety middle.</comment>
