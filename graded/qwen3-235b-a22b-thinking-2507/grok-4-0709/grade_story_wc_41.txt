<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied through "tidal longing" and chalk-dust fragility, but "pre cognitively forgetful" flaw lacks concrete cost escalation beyond vision dissipation; micro-choices align with stakes yet don't compound meaningfully.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with "chalk crumbling in his hand" showing cost; Accumulative lens holds via fog/chalk/driftwood pattern accumulation; vision flicker serves as adequate escalation but feels underweighted.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fog garden actively constrains choices (labyrinth paths) and charges final image ("mists ebbing like retreating tide"); hollow's organic hum embodies aging's sound with sensory precision that shapes the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("capture sound of growing older") signaled early and deepens through driftwood system, but vision flicker escalation lacks sufficient causal pressure; cost is felt yet escalation remains gentle under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: chalk circles reweighting forgetting/remembrance, hollow's hum answering "sound of aging" without moralizing; final image crystallizes cyclical cost through "longing would return, wave after wave."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tidal longing," "hush of unwatched tapes") modulates rhythm under pressure; minor register drift in "pre cognitively forgetful" slightly disrupts lyrical flow but pattern remains coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with varied syntax ("He believed that somewhere..."), but "echoes" repetition (8x) borders on scaffold in mid-beats; density remains high without muddling closure's organic hum imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prophet trope through tactile specificity (chalk/driftwood rituals); risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming "sound of aging" into visceral hollow resonance.</comment>
