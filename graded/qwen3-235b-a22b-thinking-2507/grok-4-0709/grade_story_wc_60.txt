<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. feeling the geese's pause is "deliberate") drive her micro-choices like crushing the crumb to test piezoelectric theory. Final shift—"skepticism softened but intact"—carries visible conceptual cost through her earned logic-based resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: geese pause (trigger) → breadcrumb testing (action) → patient observation (escalation) → unsticking via heat (climax). Closure's cost ("skepticism softened but intact") is legible on the page with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>City's fountains constrain choices (stagnation motivates her quest) and charge closure: water "trickling defiantly" directly reactivates the setting, making the final gurgling chorus inseparable from the thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally as Elara's patience pays off—geese resuming flight endorses her vigil, forcing the precise pressure-point presses. Cost is unmistakable in her altered worldview: "proving magic was just reality misunderstood" carries conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: her scientific approach to unsticking the box ("crystalline, formed by evaporated minerals") becomes the non-literal answer to "trapped history," rejecting mysticism without moralizing. Final image reweights prior decay with earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines under pressure—"piezoelectric fragments," "holographic repository"—with rhythmic control in climax ("hours stretched like constellations"). No head-hopping; voice modulates from analytical to awed without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; peak beats ("a soft pop echoing like a muffled shout of triumph") balance specificity and propulsion. Figurative language ("gurgles" washing away "hush") charges closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "luminous skeptic" trope via grounded details (childhood crystal accident, piezoelectric crumbs). Risk-taking—quiet climax through logic, not magic—heightens stakes coherently. Synthesis feels inevitable: "reality misunderstood" resonates through action.</comment>
