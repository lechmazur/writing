<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority limited to Mara; others lack contradictory impulses. Jax/Lena/Tomas function as thematic mouthpieces ("ever the doubter," "feel it in your bones") without distinct flaws or micro-choices under pressure. No visible cost to the unity shift beyond Elara's fade.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation debt: "Mara, a former engineer" appears at 182 words, past 120-word anchor point (-0.4 penalty applied). Causal lens holds tightly with one meaningful tightening (bell sequence), but planetary stabilization relies on nebula coincidence rather than earned character agency at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Orchard/arch details vividly anchor setting early. The watering bell functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (butterflies swirling to nebula), though its tactical constraints remain underdeveloped—finding it requires no struggle despite overgrown vines.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early (crumbling arches), but escalation lacks narrowing options. Resolution hinges on cosmic coincidence (nebula responding instantly to bell) rather than protagonist agency. "Reexamine divisions" theme remains abstract, never tested through concrete trade-offs like resource allocation or leadership conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Thematic echo in Elara's farewell ("Hope blooms in unity") triggers -0.7 penalty for final-paragraph moralizing. "Brambled hope" motif evolves from struggle to peace, but theme resolves into simplistic binary (isolation=bad, unity=good) without complexity—no character questions if forced unity sacrifices individuality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV wobbles between omniscient ("a ragtag group") and close-third on Mara. "Brambled hope" phrase repeats mechanically across paragraphs, flattening rhythmic control. Dialogue lacks distinct voice—Jax/Lena/Tomas speak in identical thematic cadence ("Why trust scribbles?" / "She's strangely trustworthy").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops: "thorny struggles intertwined with flickers of optimism" then "brambled hope tangled with doubt." Strong verbs ("crunched," "pulsing") propel momentum, but "strangely trustworthy" label recurs without embodied proof—felt cost resides only in Elara's fade, not the family's actions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Transforms colony tropes via chalk-message mechanic, but altruistic ghost archetype lacks fresh inflection. Emotional truth diluted by safety-hedging—all characters instantly align with Elara's plan. Specificity shines in "arch stone and crystal" bell details, though planetary stakes feel generically apocalyptic.</comment>
