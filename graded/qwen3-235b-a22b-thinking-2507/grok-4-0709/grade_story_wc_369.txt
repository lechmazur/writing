<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in maintenance worker's embodied obsession with trees; "quantified sorrow" motivation compels action without therapy-speak. Minor abstraction in emotional progression ("felt his own sorrows begin to heal") slightly softens cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: storm waning/moonlight dominating crystallizes Elias's stance shift with visible cost (buried sorrows beginning to heal). Accumulative lens holds; orientation clear by paragraph 1 with no disorientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tower's timber beams actively constrain choices (source of "witnessing" dreams) and charge final image (moonlight on wood). Micro-setting mastery: sextant's moonlight healing is essential to tactics and closure's emotional weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover trees' witness) tightens through sextant's discovery/use; agency drives escalation as Elias actively maps sorrow. Cost unmistakable: his long-buried sorrows begin healing only through deconstruction labor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete actions (mapping sorrow, tree rings) without moralizing. Final image reweights premise: "resilience" insight earned through Elias's labor, not stated. Avoids thematic echo despite high concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: maintenance worker notices hinges/dust while astronomers' tools feel alien. Rhythm modulates perfectly with storm/moonlight shifts; no head-hopping. Peak stress shows appropriate compression ("hands trembling").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "moonlight pooled like spilled mercury" exemplifies high-density imagery. Final line ("miracles unfolded... listening") recharges motif without sentimentality. Figurative language sparse but potent in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Quantified sorrow" transforms astronomical trope through specific setting (labyrinth tower) and character (humble worker). Emotional truth in "mundane miracles" avoids generic templates; risk-taking in quiet climax feels inevitable.</comment>
