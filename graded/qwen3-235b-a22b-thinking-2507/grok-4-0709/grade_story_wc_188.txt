<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in micro-choices (spinning rag despite fear), but "hopelessness" label overuse edges toward therapy-speak; embodied cost in tears-not-from-smoke lifts closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost (tears from released despair), lens holds as Accumulative/Textural; minor deduction for mosaic message feeling slightly convenient rather than earned by action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Blooming fortress constrains choice (fire reveals mosaic), final image charged by petals reflecting light; "gravity" metaphor overextension slightly undermines specificity at climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten credibly via rag-spinning decision under pressure, cost legible in trembling hands implied by "safe end"; coincidence of mosaic message slightly softens agency-driven escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (fizzling fireworks, spinning fire), but mosaic's direct "defy the weight" phrasing flirts with thematic echo; final chant reweights hope without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("filtering ambient awareness") modulates under stress; minor register drift in "reignite his passion" slightly jars with wandering artisan voice during peak tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong propulsion in discovery sequence, but filter-verb stack ("he had heard... seemed... murmured") dulls immediacy; "vibrant defiance against decay" overwrites with mixed metaphor in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ingenuity in ambient awareness method transforming despair; risks "blooming fortress" trope but freshens through sensory integration (jasmine/kerosene); emotional specificity avoids generic hope narrative.</comment>
