<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("brittle devotion") shown through ignoring doubts while mending bell, but transformation to "no longer easily shattered" lacks embodied cost; "earnestly naive" remains label-driven despite counting drips.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with spectral fish emerging, but cost ("sweat beaded" / "fragile bond") feels generic rather than specific to Elandor's brittleness; drips accelerating to "seven per breath" tightens pressure under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sapphire viaduct functions as micro-setting: weeping drips (concrete constraint) directly enable bell repair and charge final image; "plink echoing like heartbeat" integrates sensory detail with cosmic stakes without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dripping rates escalation (1→7 per breath) drives protagonist agency under accumulative lens, narrowing options through precise tempo; cost legible in "sweat beaded" and "fragility" but lacks specific sacrifice (e.g., magic depletion).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "plausible impossibility" of mending seas with sapphire drips; final spectral fish reweight prior "last fish" loss without moralizing, though "right cosmic imbalance" borders on abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "tepid like half-boiled tea" and "dripping rates" lexicon; rhythm modulates from slow dawn ritual to frantic "five per breath" under pressure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "memories flooded him" reflection; "cosmic imbalance tilted fabric of reality" violates physical logic (mixed metaphor), dulling climax despite otherwise vivid "sapphire essence" prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Lukewarm mage" trope transformed through specific sapphire-drip mechanics; "plausible impossibility" tone avoids cliché by rooting magic in measurable tempo, though cosmic stakes feel slightly generic.</comment>
