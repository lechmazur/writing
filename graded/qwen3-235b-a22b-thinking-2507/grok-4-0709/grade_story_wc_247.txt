<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (clinging to silence vs creating music) embodied through trembling hands and humming; Thorne’s "bridge the voids" motivation intensifies pressure but slightly archetypal. Final choice earned by mapped silences, cost legible in joyful sorrow as Thorne fades.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Thorne’s departure crystallizes options with felt cost ("signs of shared creation lingering"). Accumulative lens holds—silence-mapping density escalates to humming, narrowing Elias’s isolation. Orientation anchored by paragraph 1; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Harbor’s micro-setting (buoy bell pauses, flickering lights) constrains Elias’s choices and charges the final image where "empty chamber" becomes "vessel for inspiration." Sensory hierarchy precise: composer’s ear for rhythmic gaps over visual clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake ("why cling to quiet?") signaled early; tightening occurs when melody emerges from mapped silences, foreclosing isolation. Cost unmistakable: Thorne’s departure embodies joyful sorrow as Elias hums. Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens, no coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through harbor’s silence transformed into music—no moralizing. Final image ("signs of shared creation lingering") offers resonant answer to obscurity without stating a moral. Avoids sentimentality via concrete stakes: "joyful sorrow" as earned complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: composer notices rhythmic intervals, signs as "dance of unspoken understanding." Voice modulates under pressure (hesitant signing → empowered humming). Single-POV consistency; sign language indirection carries subtext without dialogue clutter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "waves lapped... quiet symphony" merges setting/action. Minor loop: "quiet" repeated 11x dilutes tension in mid-beats. No closure-dulling artifacts; final line’s "signs... lingering" recharges camera motif with zero scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mapping silence as cartography transforms creative-block tropes. Emotional specificity ("joyful sorrow") avoids templates. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; premise inseparable from harbor’s micro-rhythms.</comment>
