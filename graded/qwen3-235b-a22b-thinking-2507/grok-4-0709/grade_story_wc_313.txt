<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s duty versus buried grief; embodied through photo reactions. Final choice to share stories earns closure via prior causality (mother’s photo triggering resolve), though father’s memory return lacks micro-choice friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: gathering descendants reconfigures isolation into community with felt cost (facing father’s death). Accumulative lens holds, but "expunging solitude" phrasing near-final risks thematic echo, dulling conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Midnight Ridgeway’s twilight and wind chime anchor setting early; sapphire label charges final image. Micro-setting (photographs) constrains Elias’s choices (gathering them) and directly shapes closure, though ridgeway itself lacks tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake (memory isolation vs. shared legacy) tightens via photo trail’s escalating personal cost. Agency-driven escalation peaks at church bell tower, where confronting father’s photo compels action. Cost—unearthing grief—is unmistakable in "memories flooded back, unbidden and sharp."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through blue liqueur label’s shift from lost prosperity to communal talisman. Final image ("wind stirred faintly, as if the chime might sing again") offers non-literal answer to memory’s burden without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice distinct via Elias’s selective perception ("callused fingers tracing edges," distillery focus). "Mirrored hush" repetition risks scaffold, but rhythmic control under pressure (photo discoveries) sustains lyrical cohesion without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop in "mirrored silence"/"mirrored hush" dulls closure beat. Otherwise, high density ("rooftops emerging like ghosts") and concrete verbs propel momentum. No figurative muddle, but final-third artifact disallows 9+ globally per guidelines.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drowned-town trope transformed via precise details (sapphire elixir, Eldridge Distillery). Emotional truth in Elias’s survivor guilt feels fresh, though "precisely humane" descriptor leans generic. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
