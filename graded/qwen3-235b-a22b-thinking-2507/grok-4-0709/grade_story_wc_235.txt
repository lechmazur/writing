<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "feral nostalgia gnawing at my edges" and jealousy-to-acceptance arc, but grave discovery lacks embodied micro-choice (e.g., trembling hands); motivation stays abstract rather than visceral in inciting beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully when narrator realizes "death was just another chapter" while etching the scroll, with visible cost in "jaded wonder"; minor lens ambiguity (Hybrid/Accumulative) caps score despite flawless cost legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Birch bark scroll functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (anchoring thoughts) and charges final image ("relic of the wild within"); cabin's creaking walls pressure isolation without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate meaningfully from grave shock to jealousy-fueled flight, but dominant stake (fear of foreseen endings) lacks tangible cost manifestation; "jaded wonder" feels earned yet insufficiently physicalized in final trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action ("turning envy into elevation") without moralizing; final image reweights "feral nostalgia" as creative fuel, avoiding thematic echo while embracing complexity of mortality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "timelines bleeding like ink on wet paper" and rhythm modulates with dream intensity; minor register drift in "conceptual cost" phrasing prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "snow blanketed the world in indifferent white" exemplifies textural specificity. One paraphrase echo ("wild torrents... tame the wild torrents") deducts 0.2 despite masterful propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms grave trope through lucid dream chronicler lens; "birch bark scroll as narrative weapon" synthesizes setting/concept boldly. Near-echo of Jungian shadow work slightly caps originality at 8.9.</comment>
