<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses (duty vs dreams) manifest in micro-choices like saving Lir amid peril, but "softly commanding" veers into label-speak during climax. Interiority remains embodied except for one diagnostic slip ("dread") that lacks immediate physical cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: disenchantment forged into resolve after learning council's deception, with "lingering menace" proving conceptual cost. Causal lens holds perfectly, though the deception revelation feels slightly under-dramatized in the final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cobalt grotto charges closure via "lace-woven stars" reweighting earlier menace, and bioluminescent vines actively constrain climbing choices. Misses full 9+ as ritual mechanics feel location-agnostic despite vivid atmospheric pressure during ascent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally from council warning to ritual temptation, with Elara's choice to dip fingers foreclosing easy power. Cost is legible but the deception revelation lacks granular struggle against the starlight's "shatter soul" temptation at peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through bleeding starlight's shifting meaning—from ominous dream to tool of revelation—with final "lace-woven stars" offering resonant non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing but "path to redemption or destruction" slightly abstracts the concrete stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "lacy menace" observations and rhythmic compression during climb. Minor flaw: "softly commanding" descriptor repeats like a tic (lines 15/25/39), momentarily disrupting voice consistency under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose propulsion falters slightly with "softly commanding" label repetition and "lacy menace" near-synonym churn, though final image redeems it. Filter-verb stacks in ritual description ("waiting for," "spotted," "released") dull immediacy in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms queen-in-exile trope through specific "cobalt grotto" imagery and emotional truth in disenchantment ("hollow victories"). Fresh inflection: dreams as council deception rather than prophecy, though "eternal flames" borders cliché before precise execution.</comment>
