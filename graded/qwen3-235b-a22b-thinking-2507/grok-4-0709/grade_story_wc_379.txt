<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; Elena's grief motivates but isn't tested under pressure. Micro-choices like pocketing the locket show observational drive, yet her "fractured family" backstory remains abstract rather than altering present tactics. Strength in embodied listening during interviews, but emotional progression feels tidied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: unlocked letters yield healing with visible cost (tears, softened grief). Causal lens holds—locket → interviews → key discovery—but sirens intrusion feels unearned coincidence. Orientation anchors desert town/thrift shop by 98 words; cost proof lies in Mr. Ramirez recognizing his father's handwriting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sandstorm calm motif charges the final image (emotional serenity mirroring dawn), and the olive tree micro-setting directly enables the key discovery. Yet "vibrant courtyard" descriptions lean generic; sensory details don't constrain choices beyond the tree hollow. Strong specificity in locket's "swirling sands" engraving.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlocking emotional truth) tightens through interviews, but lacks tangible opposition—no live option foreclosed until mailbox opening. Cost is emotional (tears, softened grief), yet "distant sirens" threat introduces stakes too late without altering tactics. Pressure grows organically but risks feel abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through actions: "listening heals" validated when letters mend wounds without moralizing. Final image (embraces in sandstorm calm) reweights locket's "Follow the tales" inscription non-literally. Avoids sentimentality via specific tears/smiles, though "healing old wounds" edges close to abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV stability anchors Elena's perceptual signature ("practiced gaze," locket "warm against her chest"). But dialogue lacks distinct voices—all elders speak in identical rhythmic cadence ("voice steady as calming sands"). Tomas' "whispered his piece" feels generic, diluting character-specific lexicon under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor scaffold: "vibrant courtyard" repeated twice, "sandstorm calm" overused in finale. Clean syntax but "amber and rose" hues border cliché. No fatal loops; propulsion maintained through concrete actions (fingers tracing bark). Final line achieves textural specificity with "talisman of connection."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: thrift-store lens transforms "healing through stories" trope via desert specificity. Locket-mailbox connection feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in quiet closure (no villain confrontation) heightens stakes, though "aged locket" leans tropey. Emotional truth anchors universality without generic safety.</comment>
