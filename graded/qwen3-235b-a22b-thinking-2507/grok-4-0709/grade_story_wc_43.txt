<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority shows Elias's embodied regret through trembling hands and tears, but "motivation burned quietly" uses diagnostic label-speak in a peak beat, triggering -0.5 deduction. Micro-choices like handing back the shard reveal hierarchy of values, though emotional progression leans slightly tidy without sufficient contradictory impulses during reconciliation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise through the final image of Elias's peaceful thrum and the shard in Elara's pocket, with legible cost in his tears and the daughter's lined face. Accumulative lens holds via sensory density escalation (hymn intensifying to hologram), though conceptual cost of lost time remains slightly oblique rather than viscerally dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The vinyl shard functions as micro-setting that charges the closure—warming in his palm, refracting light, becoming a pocket talisman—constraining choices through tactile memory work. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's therapeutic focus (light, scent), though cloud-haven backdrop remains atmospheric rather than actively pressuring decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's agency-driven deepening (hymning escalating to hologram call), reweighting Elias's reconciliation need with visible cost in his tear-traced cheeks. Pressure coheres under accumulative lens via cadence shifts, but the implied cost of decades lost feels conceptual rather than concretely dramatized on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the shard's transformation—from symbol of regret to hope's vessel—with the final image ("hope's scent could reunify the broken") offering resonant, non-literal answer to fragmentation. Avoids moralizing, though "scent of hope" concept remains abstractly echoed rather than concretely shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV maintains stable therapeutic lens with distinct perceptual signature (light/scent focus), modulating rhythm during high-pressure beats like the hologram reveal. Dialogue carries subtext through sparse, goal-driven exchanges, though "decisively kind" repetition slightly flattens lexical variety under emotional stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Decisively kind" label recurs as stock phrase in peak beats (e.g., "decisively kind preparation"), triggering -0.4 loop penalty that dulls immediacy. Otherwise strong propulsion with vivid textural specificity, though mixed metaphor ("hope had a scent... like rain on parched earth") slightly muddles sensory coherence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis through "hymning the mundane" method and vinyl shard's emotional logic transforms familiar deathbed trope, with specificity in fireflies/coffee details avoiding genericity. Bold lyric structure risks obscurity but pays off via shard's closure reweighting, though hospice setting leans slightly conceptual.</comment>
