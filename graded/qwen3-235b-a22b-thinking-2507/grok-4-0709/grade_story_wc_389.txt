<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied emotion ("gaunt frame silhouetted," "callused fingers") but lacks concrete struggle in pivotal moments; "variant allegiance" concept remains thematic rather than driving tangible choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (cracked glass mirroring fragmented revelations), but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—signals accumulate without Elias altering tactics or facing narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cobalt glass portico functions as essential micro-setting: constrains choices (static-dependent signal reception) and charges the final image with spiderweb cracks symbolizing fragmented renewal, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("ancient shadows vs. corrupt dawn") signaled early, but pressure never intensifies beyond atmospheric accumulation; pilgrims arrive without creating tangible friction or visible cost to Elias's choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "cracked glass = fragmented revelations," but "variant allegiance" phrasing borders on thematic echo; final line "dawn from the void" avoids moralizing while reweighting the premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("rain-lashed glass blurring reality and reverie") and rhythmic control, though "gritty whimsy" diction drifts slightly from Elias's voice during peak storm intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with high information density, but minor figurative muddle ("sapphire wound," "whimsical fury") in high-pressure beats slightly dulls the storm's visceral impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio ghosts as "ancient shadows" elevates prophecy tropes, though "lonely visionary" archetype lacks sufficient differentiation; cobalt glass innovation provides non-obvious emotional specificity.</comment>
