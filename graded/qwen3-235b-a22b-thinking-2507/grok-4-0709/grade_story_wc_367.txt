<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority lacks embodied contradiction; "shadowed elation" repeated as label without layered irrationality. Motivation ("shape new dawn") told not dramatized through conflicted micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands (shadows transformed into renewal visions), but cost remains abstract "unseen change" rather than felt forfeiture. Lens ambiguity: accumulative buildup weakens situational pressure at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Emerald lighthouse functions as micro-setting—glowing stone and glass wick constrain ritual actions. Final image of "unprinted past" stirred by shadows charges the emerald beacon’s purpose, though digital-world backdrop stays generic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (clarity from darkness) signaled early but lacks tightening. "Steering light" action doesn’t narrow options; blackout prophecy feels coincidental rather than earned agency. Cost ("shadowed" joy) remains conceptual, not visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom vs. data emerges through shadow manipulation, but "birthing luminous silhouettes" veers toward thematic echo. Final image avoids moralizing yet overstates renewal ("promised renewal" weakens ambiguity).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice excels: "rustle of print newspapers" establishes era-specific texture; "laughter like distant thunder" shows perceptual signature. Controlled rhythm in ritual description avoids lyrical drift, though "accidentally prophetic" recurs as unmodulated tic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft strong but "shadowed elation" (3x) creates paraphrase loop. "Coiling like ink in water" overwrites pivotal shadow-stirring moment. Final line’s "unseen but inevitable" slightly muddles closure’s physicality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse beacon as truth-sentinel (not navigational) and glass wick physics as metaphor for refracted wisdom. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens theme, though digital-age premise borders on familiar.</comment>
