<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's embodied regret and contradictory impulses ("mended vase that still leaked") feel authentic, but Lila's reactive passivity limits relationship-as-crucible depth; "diagnostic label-speak" ("imperfect miracles") slightly undermines emotional rawness in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise (partial forgiveness amid orchard's destruction) with felt cost, but orchard pressure arrives too late to meaningfully tighten options earlier; Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently through sensory escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Archive's dust and perfume bottle constrain choices (ritual tool), charging the final image with "jasmine and spectral grit," yet orchard's presence remains atmospheric rather than tactically constraining until the machinery's rumble.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Apology stake intensifies through Elara's self-aware "blight" metaphor, but orchard destruction only passively pressures the timeline; cost (scarred mending) is legible yet lacks tangible tactical alteration from external stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "imperfect miracles" reweighted by the final image—apologies as induced currents that "summon spirits but not always lay them fully to rest"—avoiding moralizing while charging emotional ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust motes dancing in faint moonlight") modulates under pressure, but overwrought phrases ("gritty dawn of destruction") occasionally disrupt voice consistency in high-stakes beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density in sensory lines ("notes clashing like old grudges") falters with minor synonym loops ("imperfect and raw," "imperfect miracle"); final paragraph's thematic echo ("hush lingered... axes fell") dulls closure precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Gossip-column exorcist" transforms spiritual tropes through specific journalistic lens, yet orchard metaphor's proximity to common decay imagery slightly dilutes freshness despite cohesive emotional synthesis.</comment>
