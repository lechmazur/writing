<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses (masking isolation with forced puns while seeking connection) drive authentic micro-choices; his vulnerability-sharing earns the change. Secondary characters lack depth beyond archetypal traits (baker/mechanic), weakening relationship pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "loneliness fracture" crystallizes reciprocity’s cost through shared vulnerability. Orientation anchors early ("disused railway station"), but moon rock’s origin feels slightly convenient despite the lens holding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ivy-overgrown station vividly mirrors "polite anarchy" ("climbed cracked platforms like polite invaders"), charging the final image. Fails to constrain choices—the fire/moon rock drive action, not the setting’s physicality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten purely through Elias’s agency: sharing his story initiates the rumor chain, narrowing options toward reciprocity. Cost is unmistakable in "fracture" of loneliness, with escalation driven by accumulative pressure under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "cure wasn’t in the rock alone" reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image crystallizes reciprocity’s cost through "mutual vulnerabilities exchanged," avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s voice shines via character-particular diction ("emotional baggage" puns), but group dialogue converges into uniform "polite chaos" under pressure, lacking distinct idioms for Mira/Theo.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor density issues ("improbable rumor chains" repetition) and cliché ("whispered in the winds of rumor") in setup; tightens beautifully by climax. Zero artifacts in peak beats where it matters.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Polite anarchy" premise transforms loneliness tropes through reciprocity mechanics. Moon rock feels derivative, but rumor-chain method and "fracture" resolution synthesize into fresh emotional truth.</comment>
