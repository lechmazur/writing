<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied stress (crystallization locking movement while anxiety mounts), but "rewrite her pain into empowering tales" edges toward over-articulated interiority for peak crisis. Motivation rooted in scars-as-runes feels authentic, with micro-choices like quill selection revealing hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density buildup to Earned Stasis closure: crystals dissolving as rain returns charges the final image with conceptual cost (temporary victory before inevitable storm). Minor flaw—the shedding process lacks sufficient struggle to maximize emotional weight during the decisive beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting functions as constraint: the floating platform’s sway directly amplifies stress, while the crow quill’s tea-infused tip physically enables the climax. "Saturated hush" evolves from atmospheric detail to active pressure point during the held breath, charging the final image of dissolving crystals.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: crystallization locking movement narrows options to shedding via superstition, with visible cost (shimmering dust carried away as storm returns). Stakes tighten coherently through the held breath framework without artificial intensifiers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—scarred arms becoming "narrative runes"—avoiding abstraction. Final image of glowing runes as "armor against what came next" reweights transformation without moralizing, resonating through the dissolving crystals’ conceptual cost (beauty born of fragility).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "breath between storms" reframing time, with rhythmic control during stress ("crystalline facets bloomed... like frost on glass"). Minor register drift in "arcane arts" momentarily distances voice, but compression remains purposeful and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong propulsion but paraphrase loop in high-pressure beat: "crystalline facets bloomed across her forearms like frost on glass" followed by "crystals locked her movements" duplicates imagery. Near-synonym churn ("shed them"/"shatter her skin") slightly dulls closure’s tactile immediacy despite vivid overall craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms familiar trauma tropes through specific mechanics—crystallization as stress response, crow quill ritual—synthesized into organic emotional truth. "Breath between storms" reimagined as active timeframe rather than metaphor feels fresh, though risk-taking stops just short of bold structural innovation for 9.0+.</comment>
