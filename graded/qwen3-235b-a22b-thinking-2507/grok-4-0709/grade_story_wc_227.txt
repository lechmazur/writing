<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "uncertain alchemist" persisting underwater, but "motivation burned fiercer" triggers diagnostic label-speak penalty. Micro-choices like surfacing briefly reveal value hierarchy with physical cost in "bubbles escaped his lips".</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds through three narration beats tightening pressure, but lens ambiguity past midpoint ("dire enchantment" undefined early) risks cap. Cost legible in "acid sea lapping higher, corroding the workshop's underbelly" as persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: acid sea actively corrodes workshop underbelly, constraining choices. Key ring charm's "golden trinket" evolves from talisman to tool, charging final image where it "quelled the acid sea's fury" with concrete cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via acid's rising corrosion during narration attempts, but escalation leans slightly on charm's magic convenience rather than pure agency. Cost undeniable in "workshop tilting perilously" foreclosing escape paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete kintsugi ritual—gold veins "sealing flaws while highlighting history"—avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "pockmarks" as "stitches" without stating morals, achieving resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "cogwheels clicked like impatient heartbeats" filtered through alchemist's urgency. Minor register drift in "dire enchantment" momentarily feels author-imposed rather than character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with "molten lacquer in kintsugi" doing triple duty, but "quilting memories into cohesive tapestry" creates mixed metaphor (quilting/tapestry) triggering -0.3 coherence penalty. No closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of kintsugi with alchemy avoids trope recycling; acid sea workshop pressure feels necessary. Risk-taking in underwater narration heightens stakes, but "uncertain alchemist" archetype borders slightly on stock without deeper transformation.</comment>
