<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Limited internal contradiction; motivation clear but interiority leans tell ("burned fierce") over embodied choice. Strengths: micro-choices under pressure (memorizing reflections, lagoon adjustment) and credible endurance with visible cost in escape.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: "seed of resistance had taken root" shows irreversible conceptual cost under causal lens. Minor flaw: broadcast glitch resolution slightly convenient despite resourcefulness, diluting cost legibility by 0.2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Auric lagoon functions as micro-setting that charges the final image and constrains tactics (glow for signal bounce). Puddle reflections concretely guide navigation. Misses 9+ gate by narrow margin—lagoon’s tactile interaction (e.g., water resistance) could deepen constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>Escalation driven by agency: raid → puddle map → lagoon solution under causal lens. Cost legible in "capture loomed" and regime’s scramble. Slight dip: broadcast falter/glitch feels under-pressured; tension peaks too early before lagoon adjustment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "tyranny of indifference" shown via erased uprisings and lagoon’s revision. Final image ("freedom’s code endured") reweights premise without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; complexity in apathy vs. action lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("puddle reflections suggested a map") and rhythmic control under pressure. Minor flaw: "tyranny of indifference" phrasing drifts into abstract register mid-crisis, disrupting voice consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong propulsion but paraphrase loops ("unrevised histories" x2 near climax) and template cadence in opening ("She was...") dull immediacy. No closure artifacts; minor scaffold in reflection block prevents 8.2+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "puddle reflections map" transforms dystopian tropes through specific, grounded detail. Emotional truth in apathy’s cost avoids generic rebellion. Risk-taking (lyric map) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
