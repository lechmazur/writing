<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (gentle methods vs urgent redemption), but family estate backstory exceeds BRR limits at 22%, slightly diluting present-moment micro-choices during planting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: mosaic reveal reconfigures decay into sacredness with conceptual cost (buried guilt redeemed), though the "tenuous absolution" cost feels slightly abstract versus tangible sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Overgrown courtyard actively constrains choices (brambles parting earth) and charges final image; "chipped cup" micro-setting embodies Elias's philosophy while altering his tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen beautifully through Elias's agency (crumbling bread into soil), but mosaic discovery leans toward coincidence rather than earned causality, slightly muting the cost legibility under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through bread's transformation from relic to offering; final image of "secret warmth" reweights decay without moralizing, perfectly satisfying the non-literal answer requirement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("creeping normality noticer" framing all descriptions) with rhythmic control during planting, though "heuristically gentle" repetition slightly blurs lexicon consistency in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; "vines strangled marble statues" exemplifies textural density. Minor synonym churn on "tenuous absolution" (4 near-identical uses) triggers -0.3 scaffold penalty in final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of guerrilla gardening with historical grief (vanished bakery bread as nutrient/symbol); avoids tropes through specific, verifiable details like "heirloom seeds" framing the mosaic.</comment>
