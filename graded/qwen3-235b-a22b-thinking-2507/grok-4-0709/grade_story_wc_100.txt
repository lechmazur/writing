<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias’ "inadvertent stubbornness" manifests concretely in high-stakes void compression against resisting spirits, with embodied exhaustion ("robes heavy with water") driving choices. Motivation ("give rest a permanent address") intensifies organically through tactile interactions with the lens, avoiding stock phrasing. Minor deduction: occupational details as undertaker slightly underleveraged in tactical decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Earned Stasis as Elias sinks into "unchased peace" with visible cost in his exhaustion, crystallizing the lens’ mending cracks. Causal lens holds tightly from package arrival through void occupation; pressure narrows options via spirit resistance. Minor flaw: dream revelation slightly convenient but anchored by prior fatigue.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The library’s "impossible spaces" actively constrain choices (void compression) and charge the final image ("stillness no longer fled"). Bioluminescent algae and pressurized silence filter Elias’ perception under stress, evolving with events (cracks mending as spirits rest). Final shroud metaphor transforms setting into thematic closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (laying spirits to rest) tightens meaningfully when a spirit "resisting, pulling him into a whirlpool," forcing higher-risk void occupation. Cost (physical/emotional toll) legible in Elias’ exhaustion, but escalation lacks sufficient narrowing of options—resolution relies slightly on lens mending rather than earned tactical sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "chased stillness" resolving into "lingered, eternal" reweights the library’s purpose without moralizing. Final image of ocean’s hush as shroud offers non-literal answer to "permanent address" quest. Near-miss: "catalyst for renewal" phrase edges toward thematic echo but redeemed by visceral context.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in water-logged details ("time folded like wet paper," "drip of infiltrating seawater"). Voice modulates from weary ("shuffled through aisles") to unyielding ("refused to yield") under pressure. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during void compression. Final "shroud" metaphor exemplifies rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; sentences like "He placed the lens... refract not light, but signals" achieve triple duty. Minor density issue: "warped beam" slightly generic amid otherwise precise diction. Final image’s "ocean’s hush enveloping him like a shroud" delivers crystalline propulsion without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms undertaker trope through aquatic impossibility: spirits as "distress signals" in Morse code. Fresh synthesis of "lens as signal amplifier" and "voids as archives" feels inevitable. Risk-taking (occupying impossible spaces) heightens stakes coherently without gimmickry, though method introduction lacks early groundwork.</comment>
