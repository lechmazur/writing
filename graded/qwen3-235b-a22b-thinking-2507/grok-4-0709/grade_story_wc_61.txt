<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority shines in "cherishing tender aches" and "sentimentality swelled," but backstory about fiery cataclysms feels explanatory rather than driving present micro-choices. Contradictory impulses (sentimentality vs legacy of fire) aren't simultaneously active in scene, missing 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("infinity's shadow always loomed"), and Accumulative lens holds through density of falling petals. Slight overstatement in "her heart a mix of hope" slightly dulls the final image's legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Nebula garden functions as micro-setting: falling petals constrain navigation via sonar pings and charge the final image. "Petal edges" and "starlit vines" offer tactile specificity, but environmental pressure on choices could be more explicit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (breaking generational cycles) tightens via gear's simulations revealing "infinite stagnation." Escalation driven by agency (sonar pings refining patterns), but cost remains conceptual rather than visceral, preventing 8.8+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "petals curling in weary arcs" mirroring generational flaws. Final image reweights "troubling serenity" with "infinity's shadow," avoiding moralizing. Lacks one resonant detail charging closure beyond conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "shimmering veil of memories" and "bioluminescence" wisdom. Rhythmic control under pressure evident in "Ping—echo—adjust" cadence. No head-hopping; lyric compression taught early via "quiet sighs" motif.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density with "algorithms that could model endless loops" doing triple duty. "Quiet sighs" repetition slightly risks synonym churn but earns resonance through final reprise. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic setting with generational trauma. "Calculating machine gear" transforms trope via "approximated infinity" physics. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>
