<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (curiosity vs. dread) manifests physically through scar-linking agony/ecstasy, but "anxious elation" labels emotions rather than embodying them during peak pressure at scar fusion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("risking her very essence") as roots retract, though lens ambiguity early slightly weakens causal thread in Accumulative/Textural design.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cobalt glade constrains choice (root-bound state) and charges final image ("cobalt deepening to twilight navy" during covenant reemergence), with quantum blooms defining physical rules through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through scar-linking escalation under Accumulative lens, but "cost" of unbinding roots lacks visceral immediacy until final beats, slightly delaying cost legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through scar-network imagery reconfigured at nexus ("pledges to nurture fusion without domination"), avoiding moralizing despite covenant's thematic weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("visionary mind forever tethered") sustains under pressure; non-standard semicolons taught early enhance rhythmic control during vision sequences.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in setup ("her body a bridge...") slightly dulls momentum, but "maze topiary clipping" evolves with concrete specificity; no closure-impacting artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ecological symbiosis and neural pathways through scars transforms "root-bound" trope; quantum blooms feel specific via spore-fire burns and neural thorns.</comment>
