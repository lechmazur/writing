<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation ("restore shared balance") clear and embodied through ritual, but interior contradiction absent; patience shown via actions yet no cost to flaw during pressure. Final endurance lacks visible trade-off despite strong micro-choices in guiding newcomers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("balance was fragile but now shared"), but the tremors' easing lacks visceral legibility. Accumulative lens holds, yet "collapse" threat remains abstract without concrete on-page stakes escalation at the climax beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Archway runes and cobblestones constrain choice (footstep rhythm) and charge the final image ("runes glowing faintly"), with sensory specificity woven into action. Ebony fork's earth-resonance detail elevates micro-setting beyond ornament, though "wild hush" repetition borders on scaffold.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early ("before the collapse"), with escalation via townspeople joining the rhythm, but the central threat lacks tangible consequence—tremors ease without showing what failure would cost. Agency drives deepening, yet cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of balance emerges through rhythm's revival, but "shared balance" resolves into near-symmetry without moral complexity. Final image ("rhythm that warded off collapse") offers resonant answer, yet stakes abstraction prevents deeper thematic charge per cross-cap rule (Q4 ≤7.9 caps Q5).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("winds whispered through skeletal ruins like secrets") with rhythmic control, but "infinitely patient" repetition creates minor head-hopping in focalization. Prose modulates beautifully under pressure, though "cryptic bell tuner" label drifts toward thematic echo in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, but "wild hush" recurs four times with diminishing returns; "vines crept slower" exemplifies vague abstraction in high-pressure beats. Final line ("runes glowing faintly") crystallizes closure without muddle, though minor scaffold dulls mid-story momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rhythm-as-revival avoids trope through specific cobblestone cadence and tuning fork mechanics. Emotional truth in communal footsteps outweighs familiar "ghost town redemption," yet derivative premise (harmony vs. greed) limits risk distinction despite strong contextual integration.</comment>
