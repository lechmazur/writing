<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara's interior contradiction ("trembling hand" vs "resolve") shows embodied conflict, but lacks blind spots driving inevitable mistakes; motivation remains abstract without concrete stakes testing her courage beyond symbolic passage.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes her stance toward courage, but cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt; "faded fears" parchment lacks tangible consequence, weakening the final image's emotional charge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Shoreline lullaby and ticket punch constrain choices—waves guide rhythm, star stamp enables crossing—charging the final image; sensory details like "sea-worn robes" and "driftwood vessel" evolve with action while avoiding cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elara's indirect route traversal, but pressure lacks visible price: the "leash of doubt" breaks instantly without struggle, and ferry guides resolve obstacles without cost, leaving agency untested under true duress.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the star-stamped ticket's reprise—unused courage as tangible passage—avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "veiled ridges of her own heart" with earned ambiguity, though courage's cost remains abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in tactile details ("polished shell eyes," "velvet hush") modulating with emotional intensity; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure without head-hopping, though Mira/Thorne voice distinction is minimal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" repetition creates paraphrase loops (-0.3), and "fog thickened" followed by "fog that danced" muddles causality; otherwise, rhythm varies purposefully with strong verbs ("cradling," "skirting") until final beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "vigil in twilight" as active crossing ritual elevates archetypes, but ferry guides lack transformative specificity; shoreline lullaby as persistent motif avoids generic lyricism yet feels derivative of common courage allegories.</comment>
