<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses shown—Elias's motivation is pure determination without internal conflict, weakening emotional complexity despite strong embodied choices like "heart a tranquil blaze" during ritual pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: the prophecy's "grip loosen[s]" with the visceral cost of "blaze of motivation cooling to embers," under a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens where mapped silences accumulate density to reweight stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The brook actively constrains choices (mapping silences in its flow) and charges the final image ("secrets forever smoothed into hush"), though "terrestrially cosmic" occasionally drifts toward ornamental abstraction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elias's agency—mapping silences deepens pressure until the crane wing's immersion creates irreversible change, with the felt cost of his motivation cooling to "embers" foreclosing his lifelong quest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through ritual specifics: "smoothed hush" reweights the prophecy's threat without moralizing, culminating in the resonant final image where "secrets... smoothed into hush" answers the central question through action, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("cool grass cradling his knees," stardust-infused paper), but "terrestrially cosmic" occasionally strains Elias's plausible lexicon during high-pressure ritual beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in phrases like "nocturnal haven" risks dilution, yet rhythmic control prevails—final line "secrets forever smoothed into hush" delivers crystalline propulsion without scaffold or loop artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms summoner tropes through the origami wing ritual's specificity; "smoothed hush" concept feels fresh and inevitable, though "terrestrially cosmic" leans slightly derivative without deeper integration.</comment>
