<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "burned quietly within" versus serene actions; embodied emotion in needle-pricking and mist-breathing avoids labels. Final distillation earned by ambient awareness micro-choices, though emotional progression edges toward over-tidiness at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost: "profound calm settle over him" crystallizes the generational burden lifted as gutters fall silent. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds perfectly—sensory density reweights the promise’s essence. Minimal escalation suffices for length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fog-bound river crossing functions as micro-setting: ticking gutters enforce deadline, damp earth scent fuels ambient awareness. Final fog lift directly charges closure image, making environment indispensable to both tactics and earned stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten credibly via the rain’s cadence—"gutters’ ticking slowing to sporadic drips" narrows Elias’ window. Agency-driven deepening (distilling layers) reconfigures knowledge, but cost feels slightly underweighted until the calm settles as visible relief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through palimpsest metaphor without moralizing; final image of "distilled promise" reweights prior complexity into resonant, non-literal answer. No thematic echo—insights earned via needle-pricking and sensory percolation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "spindrift serenity," "ghostly under script" reflect Elias’ coachman-poet lens. Rhythmic control under pressure ("ideas began to percolate slowly") avoids syntactic monotony; no head-hopping despite reflective depth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "yarn needle hovered" shows via concrete action. Minor register drift in "percolate" risks abstraction but redeemed by "coffee brewing" simile. Closure beat ("heart unweighted") maintains propulsion without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms palimpsest trope through specific tools (yarn needle) and stakes (river guardian oath). Fresh inflection in distilling lineage via ambient awareness, though safety middle slightly tempers moral ambiguity of prior generations’ greed.</comment>
