<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("translate distance into closeness") drives micro-choices like deciphering the cylinder, but Tracker's internal conflict remains summarized ("memories haunted him") without embodied contradictory impulses during pressure. Flawed competence shown via ambiguous coordinates, yet emotional progression lacks visceral irrationality under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as they "chase closeness" with Tracker's whine embodying felt cost, but the Accumulative/Textural lens wobbles when Tracker "nudged her toward a dusty crate"—coincidence complicates without sufficient causal setup, weakening escalation's legibility at the pivotal discovery beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Scrapyard setting constrains choices (salvaged phonograph enabling decoding) and charges the final image ("scrap-strewn void"), with dust devils and rusted metal filtering Elara's perception. Micro-setting mastery: the waxed leaf's physicality drives the cylinder discovery and reprises meaningfully in the brother's fate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when coded coordinates blur hope with deception ("tinted revelations"), forcing Elara to confront illusion versus truth. But Tracker's crate nudge feels unearned—pressure escalates through riddle-solving agency yet falters when coincidence initiates the key clue, muddying escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the leaf's evolution from "frozen breath" to ambiguous clue, resisting moralizing until the final line's near-thematic echo ("chasing closeness") risks symmetry. Earned resonance via concrete particulars (wax preservation, groove braille), but the riddle's warning lacks sufficient integration to avoid slight abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Tracker's scent-based POV contrasts Elara's "intuitively descriptive" visual metaphors ("sunset bleeds like a wound"). Rhythmic control excels in "wild hush" refrains, though "tinted revelations" repetition slightly dilutes voice cohesion during high-pressure decoding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; propulsion through concrete verbs ("unearthed," "traced," "surged"). But "intuitively descriptive" appears twice as label (para 3, 6), bordering on therapy-speak in peak beats. Final line's "chasing closeness" slightly over-polishes emotional charge, risking sentimentality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bloodhound POV with coded phonograph grooves transforms spy tropes through tactile specificity (braille-like patterns). Emotional truth anchors the "tinted revelations" concept, though the resource war backdrop feels generically post-apocalyptic without unique moral calculus to elevate it beyond competent execution.</comment>
