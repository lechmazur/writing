<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("calculated fear and raw emotion") and embodied emotion ("fleshly pull of survival") excel, but intruders lack differentiation as threats, weakening secondary pressure. Final choice lacks visible cost beyond emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with Elias's guilt surfacing, but cost remains abstract ("guilt surfaced") without tangible consequence. Vibrational solution resolves conflict too neatly, denying meaningful escalation under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina constrains choices (icy terrain favors agile intruders) and charges closure ("azure coat hung heavy with ice-melt"). Micro-setting (orb's vibrations cracking ice) shapes tactics and final image with perfect specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protecting artifact) is clear, but escalation lacks tightening—no intermediate complication between intruders' arrival and Elias's flawless solution. Static conflict denies meaningful trade-offs under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment>Theme emerges through sonic vibrations purifying greed into peace, with final image ("ethereal bond he'd forged") offering non-literal answer to "sin vs. absolution." Avoids moralizing but secondary stakes lack depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fabric whispering like a lover's breath") and rhythmic control peak during vibrational climax. No head-hopping, though "logically emotional" label slightly intrudes on interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Overwritten phrases ("fleshly pull of survival intertwining with ethereal call") create therapy-speak label in high-pressure beat. Paraphrase loop in motivation description dulls immediacy despite otherwise vivid propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse engineering with sonic mysticism transforms tropes, but "sonic absolution" premise echoes familiar redemption arcs. Bold risk in vibrational mechanics heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
