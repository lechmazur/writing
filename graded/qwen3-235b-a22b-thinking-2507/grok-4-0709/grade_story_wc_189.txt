<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (fear of leaving vs. need for growth) embodied in Elara's trembling voice and twisted fingers; Kael's quiet observation reveals his chronicler role through micro-choices like placing the cicada, avoiding stock epiphanies despite high lyricism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise when Kael hands the cicada with "Transitions are like tides," crystallizing options with visible cost (Elara's whispered fear). Orientation anchors (grotto/stars/tidal pool) established by line 3; Accumulative lens holds through rhythmic deepening of time's texture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Grotto setting actively constrains choices: tidal pool's receding water forces Kael's tangential method, while the jade cicada's texture charges the final image. Sensory details (glistening wings, cool weight) reflect Kael's professional priorities without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes (Elara's fear of leaving) deepen through the pause's tension, but escalation lacks sufficient pressure—Kael's cicada method resolves conflict too smoothly without raising cost earlier. One tightening (the whisper "What if I can't let go?") is sufficient but lacks earned struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tidal metaphors: Kael's "tides pull back to reveal what's enduring" reweights rebirth without moralizing. Final image of pools "whispering of change's flow" offers non-literal answer to transition fears, avoiding thematic echo despite poetic phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Kael's chronicler lens filters details (anemones, eddies) through professional bias. Rhythmic control under pressure via sentence fragments ("Stars wheeling overhead. Still the pause held.") taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "warmly observant" repetition (3x) and borderline purple prose ("silence bloomed, vast and uncharted") cost 0.4. No loops in climax, but "rough grains and smooth passages" slightly overwrites texture concept without deepening pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of tidal chronicle + cicada rebirth lore creates fresh lens for transition anxiety. Emotional specificity in "fingers twisting like eddies" avoids generic templates, though grotto setting leans slightly archetypal without unique coastal details.</comment>
