<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Claustrophobia embodied through micro-choices (breadcrumb trail, escape checks) and visceral reactions; wistful rebellion creates contradictory impulses driving the compass alignment. Final liberation carries earned cost: "wistful sorrow for the confined world" forecloses fear without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: spatial mutiny's infinite expansion crystallizes freedom with undeniable cost ("wistful sorrow"), under Accumulative/Textural lens. Single deepening (organ swell → dimensional shift) suffices, but pressure lacks one persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Chamber walls actively constrain choices (claustrophobia panic), while compass point's "needle-like sharpness" enables alignment. Final expansion charges the starlight motif, fulfilling the 9+ gate where environment shapes the climax and reweights liberation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias's agency (pressing compass) deepens claustrophobia vs. freedom stakes through spatial mutiny's physical manifestation. Cost is unmistakable in "wistful sorrow," though fallow period's atmospheric role limits tactical tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through spatial mutiny's embodied cost: "true freedom came not from escaping shadows, but from defying them" resonates via final starlight imagery without moralizing. Slight thematic echo in "eternal starlight" edges toward abstraction but avoids sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: claustrophobia filters sensory details ("walls seeming to inch closer"), while syntax compresses under panic ("doubt crept in"). Minor thematic repetition of "wistful rebellion" slightly dilutes distinctness at peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Template cadence ("Elias moved... Elias paused... Elias felt") in climax beat dulls immediacy; synonym churn on "wistful rebellion" creates scaffold. Closure artifacts ("wistful rebellion lingered") trigger −0.7 penalty, disallowing 9+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny transforms claustrophobia trope through organ-triggered expansion—a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking heightens stakes, but compass point's convenience slightly undermines irreplaceability despite strong integration.</comment>
