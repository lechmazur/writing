<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (prove sideways time) is clear but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; Jax functions as plot device without depth. Closure choice (reversing lever) lacks character-specific tradeoffs, relying on plot convenience over earned renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens builds sensory density toward Conceptual Repricing, but lens ambiguity past midpoint weakens causality. Cost (temporal eddy threat) lands cleanly, though disorientation in early nexus description risks orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Hush of beating wings" motif evolves from setting detail to closure-charging image; bioluminescent flora and magnetic nexus constrain experiment timing. Micro-setting (station's generator) directly enables the lever action with tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving sideways time) tightens via temporal eddy threat, but escalation relies on coincidence (nexus flare) rather than protagonist agency. Cost (near-erasure) feels visceral yet lacks integration with Elara's personal stakes beyond professional risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "subdued awakenings" reweighted from biological to temporal concept; final synth-coffee offer crystallizes Earned Stasis without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo while making conceptual cost undeniable via shared laughter echoing the hush.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("icy warmth," "mechanically warm") sustains under pressure with rhythmic control. Minor dialogue convergence in climax ("You've done it, Doc"/"Told you I'd help") slightly flattens voice distinction without breaking coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density in sensory prose, but "subdued awakenings" repetition (3x) creates paraphrase loops. "Holographic principles" explanation mid-climax introduces scaffold; no artifacts dull closure but minor cadence stiffness in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of xenobiology and temporal physics through "subdued awakenings" metaphor. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off, though magnetic nexus trope slightly dilutes originality; emotional truth anchors the conceptual ambition.</comment>
