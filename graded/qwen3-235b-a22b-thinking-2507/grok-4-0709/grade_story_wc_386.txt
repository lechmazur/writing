<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority feels consistent but lacks contradictory impulses during critical moments; the globe's revelation occurs through analysis rather than active choice, weakening earnedness of her decision to weave truth carefully. No visible micro-choice when handling the globe despite established gloves-piercing chill.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with conceptual cost (truth must avoid "blame's sharp edges"), but escalation lacks pressure spikes—dream accounts summarized rather than dramatized as active investigation. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds though density increase feels slight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glacier ice functions as micro-setting that charges the final image ("shrine's ice seemed to sigh"), with warped snow globe constraining her method. Sensory details like "breath fogging the visor" and "candles dancing shadows" avoid white-room syndrome while reflecting urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (exposing injustice without shattering peace) is clear early, but escalation lacks tangible pressure—ghosts deliver betrayal via chorus rather than complicating her tactics. No visible cost paid during investigation; conceptual price (fragile peace) feels stated not viscerally charged.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through warped globe and dream cameos without moralizing; final image ("one pure thing rescued") offers resonant non-literal answer. Avoids thematic echo though "salvaged soul" borders on abstraction, saved by concrete glacial setting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("borrowed starlight" tone filtering ice observations) maintains consistency. Minor register drift in "subconscious haze" and "conceptual repricing" risks academic intrusion but voice modulation under pressure (e.g., "chill that pierced her gloves") compensates.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity ("frozen driftwood pedestal," "thawed wonder") but adjacent paraphrase loop: "whispered secrets of forgotten voyages" followed by "spectral voices that clung like frost" triggers -0.2. Final image avoids figurative muddle yet "borrowed starlight brighter" slightly overwrites.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-whisperer trope with dream-cameo mechanics transforms familiar Arctic tragedy. Emotional specificity in "baking bread" dream cameo avoids generic templates, though "borrowed starlight" tone leans on established lyrical conventions without full transformation.</comment>
