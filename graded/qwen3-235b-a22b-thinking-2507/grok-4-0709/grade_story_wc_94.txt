<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "furiously tranquil" duality, but emotional progression lacks layering—rage-to-wonder shift feels narratively convenient without sufficient embodied struggle in the climactic rewriting scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: sealing the rarefied poem with "storm-kissed wonder" crystallizes endurance with conceptual cost (censorship’s shadows persist), fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens through atmospheric reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Observatory’s glass walls amplifying thunder directly constrain Elias’s vigil, while the darkroom timer’s reset physically propels action; final rose-and-gold dawn recharges storm imagery with earned transcendence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen organically as storm pressure forces Elias to rarefy rage into truth, but the envelope’s arrival lacks causal friction—it feels fortuitous rather than earned through his prior choices under censorship.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through scar cartography transforming into "metaphors of lightning-struck resilience," though "pierce the veil" mentor quote edges toward thematic echo in the final third.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: "clouds below boiled like an unquiet sea" filters astronomy through emotional lens; rhythmic control intensifies during storm peaks without sacrificing clarity or voice consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Overwriting risk in "silver fury" lightning descriptions; minor synonym churn ("turbulent awe"/"storm-kissed wonder") dilutes momentum in high-pressure beats, though final image remains vividly charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography and censorship via scar mapping feels inevitable, but "masks slip" timeframe leans on familiar metaphor without sufficient transformation for 9.0+ distinction.</comment>
