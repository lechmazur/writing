<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in Elias' forbidden knowledge pursuit is concrete, but "brightened disquiet" leans toward label-heavy abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. Micro-choices (pressing cameo to mirror, deeper inquiries) reveal value hierarchies under pressure, though epiphanies risk feeling unearned without sufficient struggle against self-deception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis (curating nonlinear threads despite erasure risk), with conceptual cost in "shadows lengthened in his mind." However, the cost isn't pinpoint legible in a single image—erasure threat remains abstract rather than felt in the final beat, weakening Accumulative/Textural lens cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Astral orchard and bathroom setting vividly anchor the scene, but neither constrains choices or charges the final image. The cameo functions as a micro-setting object during mirror interactions, yet its role doesn't escalate to shape tactics or the ending's "resolute calm," missing the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elias' inquiries narrowing options (rewriting fates vs. timeline unraveling), driven by agency under the Accumulative lens. But pressure lacks visceral weight—the erasure cost remains conceptual rather than altering tactics (e.g., no hesitation after cracked mirrors), diluting the tightening's impact on the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through nonlinear inheritance mechanics, culminating in the final image ("chasing truths beyond the last page") as a resonant CR that reweights the orchard's purpose without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo while embracing complexity through the cost of solitary wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("blossoms unfurling in defiance of cosmic desolation") and rhythmic control shine, but elevated diction ("philosophical breakthroughs," "luminous blooms") occasionally clashes with Elias' stressed POV. No head-hopping, though stress doesn't degrade syntax as required under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose flows with strong textural specificity ("petals drifted like snow in zero gravity"), but minor scaffold appears: "blossoms unfurling... blossoms cast a hopeful glow" creates paraphrase-loop redundancy. No closure-dulling artifacts, yet rhythmic propulsion falters in reflective stretches near the midpoint.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic scale and intimate stakes transforms the nonlinear inheritance trope through specific mechanics (cameo, bathroom visions). Bold risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens thematic weight without gimmickry, making the orchard's solitary wisdom feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
