<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear motivation but interiority leans on poetic labels ("foxglove regret") rather than embodied contradiction; final choice lacks visible cost beyond stated transience, missing 9+ test for contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost ("fleeting bloom"), but cost proof fails—the "scar of purpose" image implies cost without showing its tangible effect on Elara's actions or options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid opal library and glass orchids lack causal constraint; the bamboo tube charges the final image, but micro-setting fails 9+ gate as environment never pressures choices or tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through density (names emerging), but agency is passive—the song "demanded the method," and the tube's crack enables success without Elara's effort; cost remains abstract despite "fleeting bloom" reference.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through orchids/names without moralizing; final "scar of purpose" reweights ruin into meaning, though "foxglove regret" risks thematic echo but avoids final-paragraph sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frozen rainbows," "tinkling orchids") modulates with pressure, but "foxglove regret" repetition flattens voice under stress, creating a tic that undermines rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Overwriting in high-pressure beats: "foxglove regret" scaffold (4x) and template cadence ("Gently, systematically...") dull immediacy; final-third artifacts prevent 9+ despite otherwise strong propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "glass orchids holding extinct emotions" transforms tropes, but "foxglove regret" borrows Shakespearean poison motifs without sufficient transformation; emotional specificity in names (Amara, Thorne) elevates.</comment>
