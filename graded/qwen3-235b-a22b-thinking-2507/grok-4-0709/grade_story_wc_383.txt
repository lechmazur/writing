<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("skepticism warring with charm") feels abstract rather than embodied; "charmed skeptic" label dominates over concrete micro-choices during pressure. Final change lacks visible struggle in execution despite strong motivation setup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with felt cost ("weight of isolation lift, transformed into independence"), but accumulative lens escalation lacks sufficient density increase in pivotal beat; "ghostly resolve" remains conceptual rather than dramatized pressure shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Velvet garden actively constrains choice (petals vibrating for resonance structures) and charges final image ("blooms unfurling anew"); seashell functions as micro-setting that directly enables archiving action with tangible cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolation→independence) tightens via "last star" deadline, but protagonist agency feels passive; pressure grows texturally rather than through meaningful choice alteration under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through resonant particulars: "isolation became her wings" reweights prior material without moralizing; final image crystallizes non-literal answer to central question through garden's transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("petals unfurled like whispered secrets") shines, but elevated diction ("tragically radiant," "quarantined memory") occasionally violates POV lexicon during high-pressure beats, creating register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control but suffers paraphrase loops ("ghostly resolve" ×3, "tragically radiant" ×2) and scaffold sentences; "skepticism warring with charm" demonstrates synonym churn that dulls immediacy in pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of isolation/concept through resonance mechanics feels inevitable; risks lyrical compression but avoids gimmickry by grounding transformation in garden's physical response to sound.</comment>
