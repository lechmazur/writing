<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses (guardian vs. revolutionary) drive micro-choices like concealing the quill holder, but flawless competence lacks meaningful flaws; no blind spots compound choices despite strong interiority in blackout pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lacks visible cost: revolution succeeds "so quiet, the council would awaken to a world already transformed" with no sacrifice or consequence shown; blackout remains "fortunate anomaly," violating cost proof test for causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details ("velvet curtain," "faintest twilight gleam") anchor setting, but luminous fort functions decoratively; quill holder's mechanics don't constrain choices, failing 9+ gate requirement for micro-setting to charge closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes (revolution vs. council) are clear and early, but pressure never escalates meaningfully; sentinel encounter defuses without consequence, missing Band 8.8+ requirement for visible price altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "cradle of sparks" as conceptual engine; final image ("silent uprising took root") reweights premise without moralizing, though "cradling sparks of equality" edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("winking hush," "coded angles") with rhythmic control under pressure; voice modulates from "calm inventiveness" to "thrill" without head-hopping, meeting 9+ quick test despite minor register drift in "innocuous artistry."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with propulsion ("she smoothly concealed... letting sundial revert"), but slight overwriting in "half-painted face adorned with incomplete arcs of gold and shadow" creates minor scaffold in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of revolution tropes via quiet mechanics (sundial codes, bronze tool); "cradle of sparks" avoids abstraction through specific stakes, though safety middle hedging in flawless execution limits risk distinction.</comment>
