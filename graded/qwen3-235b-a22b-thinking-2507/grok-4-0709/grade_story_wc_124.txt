<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Elias balances curiosity against fear while uncorking the vial, but the "darker recollections" summary of his mother's illness leans toward told reflection rather than embodied choice under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis when Elias kneels sobbing amid crystal shadows, sealing the vial with hard-won understanding—the felt cost is visceral in "tears welled as he understood." Minor over-explanation in final line slightly dulls the Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse actively constrains choices: UV lamps enable the vial's revelation, the orchid's bloom timing pressures his decision, and "crystal shadows" charge the final image where pollen patterns mirror grief—environment directly shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation (vanilla/rain → jasmine/earth → illness memories) under Accumulative lens, narrowing options to confront grief. Cost is unmistakable in his sobs, though technicians' unexplained exit slightly undermines pressure coherence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through vial/orchid duality—"portals to her" realization reweights memory without moralizing. Final image of luminescent pollen mirroring inscriptions delivers Conceptual Repricing, but "wiser now" edges toward tell in the catharsis beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful: scent-focused POV where "aromatically cautious" shapes every observation. Rhythm accelerates during memory flood ("jasmine... earth... herbal teas") then slows for orchid's "pulsed luminescence," avoiding stress-induced voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "genetic whispers" and "crystal shadows" show textural specificity. Minor overwriting in "symphony of revival and loss" and "whirlpools of memory" slightly muddles two peak beats, preventing 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope through botanical specificity—scent as memory portal grounded in "alchemical transformations." "Wistful lantern broker" risks quirkiness but earns freshness via tangible light/memory connection, though "alchemical" detail feels generically mystical.</comment>
