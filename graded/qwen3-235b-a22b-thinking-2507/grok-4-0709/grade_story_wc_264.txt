<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in action; motivation ("cultivate sparks") is clear but interiority relies on summary ("insomnia was no curse but a vigil") without embodied micro-choices during the charm sequence. No visible internal conflict when touching the clock.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost ("lullaby fractured further... world remained vast"), but escalation under Accumulative/Textural lens lacks causal rigor—why singing works feels hand-wavy despite strong density buildup. Final clock tick charges the image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Glowing dunes function as micro-setting: luminous grains constrain movement ("boots sinking"), charge the climax (blooms become saplings), and mirror Elias's hope. Chess clock specificity could tighten, but environment decisively shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes ("nurture faint glimmers") signaled early and deepen texturally, but conflict lacks teeth—raiders mentioned but absent, no tangible opposition testing commitment. Cost is legible ("endless vigils"), yet pressure isn't concretely tested beyond the charm sequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "sparks in unlit corners" evolves from abstract motivation to literal saplings. Final image ("hope took root") reweights the premise without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite early "nurture faint glimmers" near-redundancy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice has distinct texture ("dreamless freight guard," "fractured lullaby") and rhythmic control, but minor POV slippage ("legends spoke") disrupts focalization. Perceptual signature shines in quantum observations, yet stress compression feels underdeveloped during the charm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful variation ("pulsed like forgotten heartbeats"), but "methoded his enchantment" creates lexical jarring. No loops or scaffold; final line ("hope took root") resolves with textural precision, though minor muddles persist in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Synthesizes quantum concepts with post-apocalyptic hope through specific choices (dreamless POV, chess clock), but "divergent archive" feels under-explored as a device. Fresh inflection in "occasionally everywhere" trait, yet emotional risk-taking lacks deeper stakes.</comment>
