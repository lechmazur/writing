<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation ("plant resilience in dry soil") is embodied through Elias's precise key-decoding under duress, but "motivation burned steady" edges toward abstraction without sufficient physical counterweight in the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: chains remain but seeds are secured, with cost legible in "temporary burden" and the visceral image of green shoots piercing arid earth reconfiguring hope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Piano bench functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (Elias's chained reach) and charges closure; rusted hooks and DNA-arrow fletching organically mirror the theme of resilient growth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten credibly as invaders breach the perimeter, forcing Elias's final key sequence under pressure; cost (continued captivity) is felt but slightly undersold against the monumental seed-vault victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: the arrow's "directed growth" symbolism reweights at closure as green shoots, avoiding moralizing while making resilience viscerally legible.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("movements a dance of restrained elegance"), but "staggering grace" recurs as a near-tic, diluting its impact during high-pressure decoding sequences.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Figurative density risks overwriting in the decoding beat ("weaving through possibilities like a vine seeking light"), though rhythm control during the invaders' arrival ("boots crunching over shattered glass") remains taut.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carnival decay with ecological hope avoids dystopian clichés, though the "DNA arrow" borders on convenient symbolism without deeper integration into Elias's strategy.</comment>
