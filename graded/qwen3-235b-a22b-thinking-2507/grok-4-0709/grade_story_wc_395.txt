<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's "brightly attentive" trait manifests concretely in noticing 47 patterns, driving key choices; micro-choices under pressure (lying to AI, navigating debris) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost in the bittersweet download. Contradiction (corporate duty vs obsession) sharpens but isn't fully simultaneous in climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options: truth known but crew gone, logs self-erasing, burden now solely hers—"weight of secrets preserved only in her memory" makes conceptual cost undeniable. Accumulative lens holds perfectly through escalating 47 patterns to the patch's final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The Social Nexus Archive functions as micro-setting: warped songs supply clues, server hum pressures choices, and the patch's frayed edges charge the final image. Sensory details ("hollow quiet where voices should have been") constrain action while evolving causally with the logs' self-erasure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation through accumulation tightens stakes relentlessly: recurring 47s deepen into the patch, then logs, culminating in AI detection forcing the download race. Cost is unmistakable—logs spiraling into deletion abyss, leaving only her memory to bear the secret.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of digital erasure vs memory emerges through the patch's journey from deleted profile to printed artifact; the final image reweights "where deleted files go" as human memory's burden without moralizing. "Weight of secrets preserved only in her memory" delivers resonant non-literal closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in tech-poetic diction ("petabytes of abandoned posts," "warped refrains whisper clues"); rhythm compresses during panic ("In a panic, she downloaded...") while maintaining lexicon consistency. Patterned elision (how she bypassed AI) is taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold: "sensed absence" evolves meaningfully from hollow quiet to new burden. Final line recharges opening ("digital mausoleum" → "weight of secrets") with crystalline propulsion. Figurative language sparse yet potent ("profiles lingered like ghosts") in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital archaeology and space mystery transforms tropes through specific stakes (47 as breadcrumb, physical patch in digital archive). Emotional truth in bittersweet resolution avoids sentimentality; risk-taking elevates stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
