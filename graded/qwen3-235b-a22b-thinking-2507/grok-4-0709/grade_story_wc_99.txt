<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "words diffusing like vapor" apology—embodied regret avoids therapy-speak. Micro-choice of speaking aloud earns closure, but "cerulean regret" label risks abstraction without sufficient physicality in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost: "remnants of sorrow carried away" as he prunes bonsai anew. Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly—lace instructions deepen remembrance's rhythm until horizon-pointing compass crystallizes reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ghost compass and lace pattern function as micro-setting: compass needle syncs with lace rhythms to constrain choices, charging final horizon image. "Damp sand" grounding and "windswept bonsai" roots make environment active pressure, not backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias' agency: deciphering lace instructions transforms passive remembrance into active "pruning" of regret. Cost legible in "weight lift, diffused into manageable wisps"—felt emotional trade-off without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through lace's woven words becoming "map for healing," avoiding moralizing. Final cerulean waves reweight "unspoken apologies" as diffused color—resonant answer to central question without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in bonsai-tutor pacing: "murmured each line aloud, drawing out syllables as if tutoring a stubborn branch." Rhythmic control under pressure flawless—no head-hopping, psychic distance shifts intentional with tide metaphors.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "rhythmically placid" cadence mirrors emotional state. Minor density issue: "blue-tinged sorrow that colored his days like the sea meeting the sky" slightly overwrought for high-pressure beat, risking clarity near midpoint.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ghost compass pointing "inward" transforms nautical trope into emotional navigation. Risk-taking heightens stakes—lace instructions could feel contrived but earn credibility through bonsai-tutor's slow deciphering method.</comment>
