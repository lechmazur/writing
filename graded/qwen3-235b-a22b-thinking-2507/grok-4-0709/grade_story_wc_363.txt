<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (devotion vs. fading self) shown through embodied weaving actions, but "latent sacrifice" label risks therapy-speak; micro-choices like fitting puzzle edges into loom frame reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visible cost (dissolution into bamboo whispers); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density increase in final weaving sequence where "raveling silence shattered" reweights the dominant stake of message delivery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orchard's stone apples and bamboo creak constrain choice (loom placement); amber bead's physical properties charge the final image as "light winking out" while sap-hardened tree directly enables the ritual's mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure tightens through puzzle-piece integration where "each weave drew from her own lifeline," narrowing options to sacrifice; cost legible in "essence fade" as tangible consequence of agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through woven conduit as non-literal answer to "impossible distance," avoiding moralizing; final image of silent loom reweights "forgotten orchard" with maternal cost without abstract assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("slender stalks whispered secrets," "sap hardened into amber droplets") filters all description; rhythmic control peaks in closure sequence where short clauses ("Elara felt her essence fade") mirror dissolution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "stoically sparkling" repetition (3x) slightly dulls closure beat; otherwise high density ("jagged fragments—not whole pieces, but jigsaw puzzle edges") avoids purple prose while advancing atmosphere and ritual mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weaving-as-communication trope through specific "rummage sale box" discovery and bamboo forest logic; emotional truth in maternal sacrifice avoids generic templates despite familiar premise.</comment>
