<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("hollow shell" vs. "flicker of wonder") drives micro-choices under pressure, but the empathy shift at the lake risks unearned emotional arithmetic; "pang of regret" lacks sufficient embodied contradiction preceding it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly—the dissolving signature reweights the time-travel premise with conceptual cost—but the Orientation Test anchor (who/where/when) arrives at 112 words, narrowly avoiding penalty while creating initial disorientation that slightly muddies early causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The baseball’s "delicately robust" texture evolves from leather descriptor to ecosystem metaphor, constraining Alex’s choices (e.g., clutching it in the tunnel) and charging the final image; bioluminescent lake mirrors his resilience with zero generic placeholder language.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (empathy void vs. dirty past) tighten through Alex’s newspaper-deciphering agency, but the transition from "why bother?" to tunnel entry lacks sufficient causal friction; cost legibility suffers slightly as the lake revelation resolves internal conflict without tactical trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (signature dissolving = release), avoiding moralizing, but the final "path to redemption" phrasing risks sentimentality; non-literal answer ("empathy kindled... in robust soul") reweights the premise without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("jaded wonder," "con artist’s eye for deception") modulates rhythm under pressure; newspaper misprints read as authentic micro-choices, with elision (memory wipe mechanics) taught early and paid off in the lake revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats, but "delicately robust" repetition (3x) edges toward synonym churn without sufficient pattern-teaching in the first third; final line’s lyrical compression ("Alex found not just wonder, but a path") avoids overwriting while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-travel trope with memory wipe and bioluminescent setting feels inevitable; "labyrinth of choices in everyday" transforms familiar redemption arcs through specific, grounded newspaper-clue mechanics without gimmickry.</comment>
