<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction lacks active manifestation; "dappled resolve" feels abstract rather than embodied choice. Tremor moment shows emotional layering but no trade-off cost scales to closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost ("measured mercy"), but adhesive analysis breaks causality—composition noted off-page via "portable lens" without process. Lens ambiguity pre-midpoint caps high-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Volcano's breathing constrains choices: heat pulses trigger Elias's realizations, and fissures charge final image. "Stone walls expanding" grounds sensory specificity, making environment indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early (mining vs. sanctity), but escalation lacks agency-driven tightening. Chain discovery resolves conflict coincidentally; no visible price paid for harmonization beyond abstract "dappled resolve."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</comment>Final image reweights "surveyor's chain" into "measured mercy," avoiding moralizing. But Mira's plea ("Preserve the heart...") functions as thematic echo, nearly triggering penalty for on-the-nose wisdom in closure beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct machinist perceptual signature ("portable lens," "calibrate floodgates") shines, but "dappled resolve" and "slyly heartfelt" drift into authorial abstraction under stress, dulling interiority's urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Template cadence in "On one side... On the other..." triggers -0.4 loop penalty. Filter-verb stack ("Elias felt... realized... knew") in closure beat obscures embodied cost, disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of engineering/spirituality via adhesive code, but "encrypted compassion" feels gimmicky. Transformation test passes: swapping "volcano" for generic site would break breathing metaphor's causal role.</comment>
