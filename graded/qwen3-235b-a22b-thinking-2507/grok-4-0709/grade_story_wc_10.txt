<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority excels with embodied contradiction ("lips pursed, eyes alight") but "heat-mapping emotions" summary risks diagnostic label-speak; survival grief and wonder layer authentically during fork activation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "sound returned, not as noise, but as music born from emotion's heat" reweights silence's premise through irrevocable change; Accumulative lens holds via thermal density escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Winterglass dome constrains every choice—frosted glass visualizes heat maps, ice-lilies' glow enables vibration; "vines quivering as if remembering rhythm" charges final image with environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist's agency: emotional heat-mapping narrows options from personal grief to collective hope; cost legible in "tears" as silence transforms, though external pressure lacks physical urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</comment><comment>Theme emerges through "music born from emotion's heat"—non-literal answer to "translate silence into music" via thermal resonance; avoids moralizing by charging closure with "resilience" as blooming sound.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "frost-etched panes trapped winter's breath like silent symphony" filters setting through musician's POV; rhythmic cadence modulates from daze to "pure and defiant" hum without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "terror of capsize, grief for lost shipmates" summary; otherwise crystalline propulsion—thermal gradients "danced like silent notes" avoids metaphor muddle while advancing plot.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: emotional heat as vibration source transforms "silence apocalypse" trope; specificity of "thermal lenses visualizing warmth as colorful auras" avoids genericness, though risk-taking stays within safe bounds.</comment>
