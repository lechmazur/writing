<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's interior contradiction ("accidentally prophetic touch") and embodied motivation shine, but secondary characters lack micro-choices under pressure; the mayor's confession occurs off-page without visible struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("voice trembling with relief"), but microdot mechanics feel convenient—no resistance during cookie placement weakens causal pressure at the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lighthouse beam as "conductor's baton" charges the final image, yet the rocky path/slushy sea never constrain choices; setting remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure point.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transforming secrets) tightens via microdot deployment, but the "grand" cookie placement lacks escalation—Elias faces no opposition, muting the cost of his orchestration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: "familiar enigmas made manifest" reweights the premise without moralizing; the final flowing currents image delivers resonant non-literal resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("open secrets—truths everyone sensed but never voiced") is character-particular, but subtle tense shifts ("he set to work"/"he orchestrated") create minor distance fluctuations under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding; "pulsed with potential" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Final line’s "enigma into enlightenment" achieves crystalline rhythmic control without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Microdots in fortune cookies transform spy tropes through specific stakes, but the "orchestrate" metaphor leans slightly on familiar orchestral clichés without full conceptual novelty.</comment>
