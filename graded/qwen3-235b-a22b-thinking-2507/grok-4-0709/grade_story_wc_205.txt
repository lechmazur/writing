<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Elias recognizes his "burnished sorrow" in the shard's coded lament, embodying poetic hope and revolutionary despair simultaneously; minor flaw: "burnished sorrow" label repeats without fresh embodiment in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully when Elias clutches the shard amid settling time-veils, crystallizing redemption through reimagining—but "time became visible" concept arrives past 120 words, creating brief orientation debt that weakens early causality anchoring.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mirror-covering method transforms the baroque asteroid from backdrop to micro-setting: salvaged silks and reflective surfaces constrain storm-survival tactics, directly charging the final image where the shard becomes a "talisman" against temporal chaos.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Protagonist agency drives escalation: Elias adapts revolutionary mirror-superstition to shield the shard during temporal storms, narrowing options to a single decisive act; cost crystallizes when the "spark rekindle[s]" transforms lifelong sorrow into purpose without erasing loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the shard’s evolution from disputed artifact to revolutionary talisman; final image ("burnished mirror to his soul") reweights the premise as redemption through reimagining, avoiding moralizing while embedding cost in the asteroid’s "sorrowful beauty."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elias’ poetic lens filters decay as "gilded arches twisted like forgotten sonnets," with syntax tightening under storm pressure ("time-veils whipping... like sorrowful winds"); no head-hopping in single-POV execution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("burnished sorrow" repetition) and slightly elevated diction in reflective beats; offset by crystalline closure propulsion where "shard clutched like a talisman" recharges the opening’s decay imagery without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "visible time" physics with archaeological dispute creates non-obvious stakes; risk-taking in Accumulative/Textural lens heightens emotional truth through the mirror method’s tactile ingenuity, avoiding genre clichés.</comment>
