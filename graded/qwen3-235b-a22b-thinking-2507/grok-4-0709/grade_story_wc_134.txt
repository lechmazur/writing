<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in "rigid predictions" versus fluid awareness, but transformation lacks embodied struggle; "gasped" and "realized" lean toward label-heavy emotion in pivotal inhabitation moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (limited clairvoyance exposed), but cost legibility weakens slightly in the inhabitation sequence; "felt inevitable" risks telling over showing the emotional price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cave pearl functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (overriding foresight) and charges the final image ("eyes glowing with bright darkness"), though "bright darkness" repetition edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation via sensory density (unpredictable melodies, overlapping shadows) reweights the "magnify everyday magic" stake effectively, but the cost of lost foresight lacks visceral immediacy during the inhabitation climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (crystal songs, symphonies from laughter), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "unseen forces" without stating the lesson, though "true magic lay in the unknown" skirts thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("futures unfolding like maps," "ink bleeding into water") sustains voice under pressure; rhythmic control modulates beautifully from lullaby to storm notes without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor synonym churn in "steadily unpredictable" repetitions (×4) and "overlapping shadows" (×3) slightly dulls closure momentum; otherwise high density with zero figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clairvoyance trope through musical cave logic; "bright darkness" reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight, though cave pearl integration edges toward symbolic convenience.</comment>
