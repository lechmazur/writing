<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "hard softness" motif is concrete, but Mia's underdevelopment weakens relationship crucible. Diagnostic label-speak in "pain is a teacher" line triggers -0.4 penalty despite strong embodied scars.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with Charged Poise closure, but cost proof is oblique: "Mia's tears" lacks visceral specificity to fully satisfy cost test. Orientation solid within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Porcelain box functions as micro-setting charging final image with "lighter now, its burden shared." Moonlight actively shapes tactile choices like tracing cracks, meeting 9+ gate via constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stake tightening occurs when box opens, but Mia's presence creates minimal pressure escalation. "Bargained bits of her youth" over-explains cost rather than showing earned trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme resonates through porcelain cracks mirroring scars, but Eli's explicit "pain is a teacher" line in climax triggers -0.6 thematic echo penalty, undermining earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in firefighter's tactile observations ("callused but gentle fingers"), though "slow dance of celestial bodies" repetition creates subtle cadence loop in reflective beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong propulsion but "bargained bits of her youth" suffers therapy-speak label artifact in high-pressure beat. No closure-impacting loops, but minor overwriting in "performing its slow dance" opening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of firefighter-as-healer with porcelain box symbolism, but "lost hiker" trope lacks full transformation. Emotional specificity in scar storytelling elevates beyond template.</comment>
