<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation "certify wonder" feels abstract and told rather than organically conflicted; synesthetic blessing lacks tradeoffs or embodied struggle despite vivid sensory rendering. No interior contradiction—perfect commitment undermines credibility of high-stakes ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost: "cavern pulsed with subtle energy" legibly reweights wonder's burden. Accumulative lens holds via sensory density escalation, though ritual's frictionless execution slightly dulls stakes legibility at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice cavern actively constrains choices: prismatic bells refract sound, "sculpted hush" must be maintained, tremors test control. Final image ("hush sculpted anew") charges closure through micro-setting evolution, fulfilling 9+ gate with environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving wonder) tightens via ritual's intensifying demands under Accumulative lens, but cost remains conceptual until release. Agency lacks adaptation—no meaningful trade-offs during strikes—softening escalation despite lyrical pressure build.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "wonder as chisel" crystallizes in final image without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite "certify wonder" repetition by embedding it in action ("fossilized wood mallet striking bell"). Resonant subtext in aurora spirits as fettered awe.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV voice distinct through synesthetic perceptual signature ("melodies into living rainbows"), rhythm modulating with ritual intensity. Minor register drift in "oscillating repose" feels academic but consistent with ceremonial precision; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Near-loop in middle beats: "calm settling like fresh snow... stirring with subtle urgency" followed by "heart oscillated between repose and gentle thrill" slightly dulls propulsion. Otherwise vivid density with strategic telling; final line ("hush sculpted anew") delivers crystalline closure resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms "last bell ringer" trope via synesthetic prism-song mechanics. Emotional truth in framing wonder as essential labor, but "certify wonder" phrasing risks prompt-like abstraction. Specificity in amber sheet/fossilized wood elevates beyond generic mysticism.</comment>
