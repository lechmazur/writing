<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in scene; hope remains untested despite insomnia. Strengths: embodied emotion ("saffron quiet"), concrete micro-choices (dipping brush in moonlight). Final distribution choice is earned but cost (enduring insomnia) isn't viscerally conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with felt cost ("insomniac eyes heavy yet alive"), but cost lacks pinpoint legibility. Orientation clear by 100 words. Accumulative lens holds consistently through density escalation of symbols.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Greenhouse constrains choices (moonlight filtration), rice paper scroll directly enables closure action. "Saffron quiet" atmosphere charges final image. Micro-setting (distilled moonlight water) alters tactics. Meets 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via Pacific script symbol, but cost remains abstract (no tangible loss beyond fatigue). Agency clear in symbol selection, yet pressure lacks visible price escalation. Accumulative escalation sufficient but cost not unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image ("pass on the quiet flame") reweights theme through concrete action without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; insights earned via Andean/Pacific daydreams. Resonance arises from particulars, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("golden hues dancing on leaves"), rhythmic control matching focus intensity. No head-hopping; compression taught early (backstory fragments). Elision paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in brush description ("bristles ended in a sliver of meteorite"). High density but slight synonym churn ("methodically hopeful" repetition). No artifacts in closure beat; propulsion maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: insomnia + lost languages + urban decay. Moon-tipped brush transforms trope into specific tool. Avoids middle-ground hedging; emotional specificity in daydreams. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
