<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "anger at manipulation, sorrow for the misled" channeled rationally, but lacks genuine struggle—flawless execution avoids "inevitable mistakes" and "genuine struggle" required for high bands. "Emotionally rational" label recurs as diagnostic speak without embodied tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Conceptual Repricing (ivy's changed perception reweights noble lies' societal cost), but cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt; no on-page personal forfeiture weakens "unmistakable cost" proof test despite strong Accumulative lens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Disused station and ivy function as micro-setting that constrains timing (petal drop) and charges closure—"ivy seemed less oppressive" crystallizes thematic cost. Rosebush's petal drop integrates causally with artifact discovery, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth rescue) tightens through Elias' methodical analysis, but agency feels observational rather than pressured; conceptual cost (historical injustice) lacks tangible on-page tradeoff, weakening escalation under Accumulative lens despite coherent pressure buildup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through letter/ivy parallels without moralizing; final image offers non-literal answer to "can truth overcome noble lies?" Avoids thematic echo by dramatizing parallels via station's decay. Conceptual cost lands without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ivy clung like whispered secrets") and rhythmic control elevate voice, but filter-verb stacks ("Elias had spent," "he believed") in opening dull immediacy. Lexicon stays consistent though stress narrows sensory detail insufficiently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Minor template cadence in opening ("Elias was... Elias had learned... Elias arrived") triggers -0.4 loop penalty. Final paragraph's "resolute, his mission... bridge between buried past" risks thematic echo but avoids outright moralizing, sparing harsher deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of historical truth-telling with railway decay metaphor elevates familiar "noble lies" premise. Emotional specificity in "heart ached with weight of buried injustice" avoids generic templates, though risk-taking stays within safe literary bounds without transformative structural boldness.</comment>
