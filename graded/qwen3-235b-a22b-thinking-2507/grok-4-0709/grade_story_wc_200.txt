<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority relies on evocative labels ("luminous ache") over embodied contradiction; Thorne's guilt manifests concretely through the tooth, but Elara lacks micro-choices showing trade-offs between fear and compassion during the ritual's pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as Thorne dissolves into light, but cost legibility falters—centuries of regret lift via stated "luminous ache lifted" rather than visceral imagery (e.g., the tooth's physical transformation could anchor the cost more concretely).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Echo Gorge actively constrains choices: its acoustics force distorted harp notes to bridge worlds, and the final silence charges the closure—Thorne's release is measured against the gorge's eternal echoes, making environment indispensable to the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen texturally (laughter dislodging guilt), but escalation lacks protagonist agency; Elara's "pursuit" remains passive invitation without tactical adaptation under pressure, leaving Thorne's surrender feeling unearned rather than compelled by her choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through sensory action: Thorne's rusty laugh transforming the tooth reweights "luminous ache" without moralizing, offering a resonant answer to whether joy can mend regret via the final dissolving light.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in sound-focused details ("notes that bent and warped"), but "luminous ache" drifts into thematic label-speak during high-pressure beats, slightly diluting the otherwise controlled rhythmic compression of Elara's focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Minor synonym loops in closure ("luminous ache" → "luminous ache lifted") risk dilution, yet propulsion remains sharp; harp mechanics are conveyed through concrete action ("plucked the strings, sending forth notes") avoiding overwriting despite lyrical density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "soul collector" trope via specific mechanics (misaligned harp distorting reality), but "luminous ache" edges toward cliché; emotional truth in Thorne's absurd-folly confession elevates beyond surface novelty.</comment>
