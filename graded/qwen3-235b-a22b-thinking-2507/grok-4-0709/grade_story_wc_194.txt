<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("dynasty ender" vs exile choice) embodied through tactile micro-choices like handling the crank, but backstory summary dilutes present-stakes causality; final renunciation earned by vibrational evidence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options with visible cost ("dynasty truly ended... eloquent silence"), but lens ambiguity in mid-scene (causal vs accumulative pressure) slightly undermines escalation coherence before the spectral voice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sepia reading room functions as micro-setting: dust-moted light constrains perception during revelation, oak shelves anchor spatial choreography, and fading wallpaper directly charges the final "twilight's embrace" image with cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs legacy) tightens through standing wave mechanics, but Elias's agency blurs during auditory revelation; pressure feels externally delivered rather than earned through active choices beyond initial crank turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "golden shadows" reweighted from sanctuary to burden, but "freedom it granted" edges toward thematic echo; final silence resonates as non-literal answer to legacy question without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("faded wallpapers whispered") modulates with stress, but "unyielding motivation" label slips into therapy-speak; rhythmic control falters during reflection block with uniform sentence stems.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops in closure beat, but "unvoiced narratives, yet now amplified" shows paraphrase redundancy; overwriting in "harmonious secrecy" slightly dulls momentum despite otherwise purposeful density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gramophone mechanics with intuitive revelation transforms "haunted object" trope; "standing waves" as auditory illusion method feels inevitable yet non-obvious, heightening stakes through sensory specificity.</comment>
