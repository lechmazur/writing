<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (logic/sentiment) shown through starling interpretation and tear, but "secretly sentimental" label risks diagnostic phrasing; micro-choice of flame channeling earns closure though cost remains subtle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with visible cost (single tear for bridged worlds), but starlings' coincidental arrival slightly undermines Accumulative lens pressure; crystal transformation reconfigures meaning without soft reset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Kaleidoscopic waterfall and frozen dew crystal constrain choices (light refraction calculations, vapor infusion), charging the final talisman image; sensory details filtered through alchemist's precision yet poetic bias avoid white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harmonizing logic/intuition) tightens through starling pattern interpretation forcing intuitive leap; cost legible in tear, though "before final transformation" timeframe lacks live-clock pressure to narrow options earlier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through crystal's thaw (logic/intuition fusion) not moralizing; final talisman image answers "touch of wonder" question with conceptual cost (emotional vulnerability as strength), avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (alchemist's measured cadence shifting to lyrical flow under starling influence); rhythmic control sustains tension during flame channeling without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold but near-overwriting in early metaphors ("prismatic mists danced like forgotten dreams"); density slightly obscures causality in setup though closure image remains sharp and propulsion intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy as emotional logic via dew crystal/starling mechanics; risks poetic abstraction but specificity (frozen tear gem, grandmother's petals) grounds universals without derivative tropes.</comment>
