<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's "stoic wonder" trait drives action but interior contradiction is underdeveloped; "calm resolve" and "functionally creative" lean toward label-heavy abstraction rather than embodied struggle during pipe-welding. Micro-choices lack genuine friction between hope and decay.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with sprouting seeds and bioluminescent algae reweighting abandonment into possibility, but lens ambiguity persists past midpoint—causal pipe-fixing and textural celestial motifs compete without clear teaching until the sextant alignment beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The hydro-infrastructure constrains every tactical choice (ruptured pipes dictate rerouting, carnival debris enables patches) and charges the final image; "vines choking light shafts" and "dormant seeds in walls" evolve causally with the water flow, avoiding static symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when Elara shifts from surveying to resurrecting the hydro-system, but agency feels slightly convenient—the sextant's fortuitous discovery and perfect solution lack struggle, muting the conceptual cost of "fractured dreams" versus tangible renewal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete particulars: "maze of intentions" transforms from architectural failure to blueprint via redirected water, with the final "tentative promises" of sprouts rejecting moralizing while reweighting hope through hydroponic bays, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in engineering-filtered details ("natural light shafts with structural supports"), but "driven by a motivation to puzzle out new equations for hope" slips into thematic abstraction, briefly fracturing the pragmatic voice during high-pressure surveying.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops and vivid propulsion ("water began to course through long-dormant pipes"), yet "stoic wonder" repetition (3x) creates subtle cadence monotony; "fractured dreams" borders on thematic echo but avoids full penalty through contextual integration with the sextant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms space-opera tropes via civil engineering pragmatism—carnival debris repurposed for pipe patches and sextant-as-sighting-tool synthesize decay with hope organically, avoiding sentimentality through the hydro-system's tangible mechanics.</comment>
