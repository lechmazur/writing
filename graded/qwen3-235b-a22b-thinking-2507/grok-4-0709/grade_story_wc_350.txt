<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses; "empathetically decisive" trait remains label-only despite four repetitions. Final choice (affixing weight) shows no visible cost or internal struggle, undermining Earned Stasis. Strong embodied detail ("cool metal pulse") but over-reliance on abstract descriptors like "vigorous tender resolve" weakens micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise: cuckoo weight chiming multilingual snippets) lands with conceptual cost (repurposed object's new purpose). Causality frays in key beat—affixing weight magically amplifies grain talks without mechanical logic—but Accumulative lens holds via linguistic resonance. Orientation clear by paragraph 1 anchors stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cuckoo clock weight functions as micro-setting: constrains choice (lifting heavy object) and charges final image (transformed chime). Grain elevators lack active pressure despite vivid description. "Borrowed starlight" evolves from atmospheric detail to functional resource (projecting beams), satisfying 9+ gate via recurring object charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (connecting communities) tightens when weight affixation transforms mechanism, narrowing options to linguistic bridge-building. Cost remains abstract—farmers' skepticism melts unrealistically fast with no personal sacrifice from Elara. Pressure accumulates via language blending but lacks tangible escalation beyond conceptual unity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: interspersed languages reconfigure "grain elevator talks" into communal rhythm. Final image ("stars watched over harmonious dawn") resonates without moralizing, reweighting isolation through charged particulars. Avoids thematic echo—insights arise from Elara's physical labor, not abstract pronouncements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("gears whispered secrets," "voice a melody that wove through air") with rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift ("vigorous tender resolve") slightly clashes with librarian voice, but lyrical compression ("under hush of borrowed starlight") teaches pattern early. No head-hopping; POV consistency elevates tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong propulsion but paraphrase loops weaken density: "empathetically decisive" repeated verbatim 4x with minimal variation. Mixed metaphor ("vibrations carried on the wind, like distant conversations in creaking steel") reduces clarity. Final paragraph's "vigorous in its tender rebirth" edges toward overwriting but avoids closure damage.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: astronomical clock mechanics literalize linguistic bridge-building via cuckoo weight's repurposing. Emotional specificity avoids templates—Elara's quiet resolve feels earned through tactile labor, not heroic tropes. Risk distinction (+0.3) for structural lyricism where language blending drives causality without gimmickry.</comment>
