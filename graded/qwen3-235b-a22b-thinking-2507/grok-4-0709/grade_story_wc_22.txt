<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but lacks contradictory impulses during pivotal action; motivation clear yet untested under pressure as ritual unfolds without resistance. Final endurance lacks visible cost escalation beyond expended effort.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost (expended ritual, silent birds) under Accumulative lens. Jetty's spatial constraint anchors orientation early; lens clarity holds through final image of reawakened concord.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Jetty functions as micro-setting: spatial confines ("needle threading the sea") directly shape fertilizing tactics and charge closure's "narrow vastness" image. Sensory specificity (glowing petals, spectral horses) filters through linguistic focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim battlefield) deepens via linguistic precision, but pressure lacks narrowing of options; birds guide rather than oppose. Accumulative escalation through cadence shift (twilight to darkness) reweights soil hunger without tangible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "submerged concord" as concrete ecological pact, not abstraction. Final image of luminescent flowers reweights battlefield scars without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite "promise of renewal" phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in linguistic focus ("Tenebris florere," avian syntax as soil map). Rhythmic control under pressure: Hittite chants accelerate action while twilight deepens, taught pattern paying off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "after the reef died" repetition; otherwise high density with zero figurative muddle. Strategic telling compresses backstory without momentum loss. Final image's "waves lapping at new growth" avoids cliché through concrete charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Fresh synthesis of ecological renewal and linguistic archaeology avoids eco-fable tropes. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes, though "skeletal wasteland" borders on familiar imagery without full transformation.</comment>
