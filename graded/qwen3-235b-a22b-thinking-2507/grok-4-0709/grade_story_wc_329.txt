<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("lingered in the gap between knowing") with label-only flaw ("motivation burned quietly"); embodied emotion shines via locust shell but diagnostic phrasing in climax ("understood now: enchantment wasn't gone") triggers −0.5 deduction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly (shell crumbling charges "tarnished wonder" cost), but lens ambiguity early—Accumulative/Textural not taught until music intensifies—caps score despite valid cost proof in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: violin constrains tactics (soft play vibrates soil) and charges closure ("symphony of tarnished wonder"); metallic vines evolve causally with uprooting, avoiding static postcard syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation via density increase (music swelling to "velvet thunder") reweights stake under Accumulative lens, but narrowing of options feels implied rather than dramatized; cost legible via shell's crumble yet lacks tactical trade-off depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through locust shell's evolution (relic→dust) and "tarnished wonder" motif; final image ("beauty could be uprooted") avoids moralizing while reweighting mechanical constraints with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("gears whispered instead of leaves") with rhythmic control during music beats; minor register drift in "enforced order" slightly jars but patterned diction pays off in closure's lyrical shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Resonantly soft" appears 3x with near-synonym variation ("velvet thunder," "blooming into symphony"), triggering −0.3 loop penalty; otherwise clean propulsion and no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical orchard via locust shell heartbeat signaling; avoids derivative tropes through specific constraint-shedding cost, though emotional complexity edges toward tidy resolution in climax.</comment>
