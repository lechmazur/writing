<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (solemn archivist vs. desperate activist) drive micro-choices under pressure; "FORGIVE TO FREE" plea earned through prior debris parley with visible emotional cost. Specter underdevelopment irrelevant as single-POV focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Decisive Change lands cleanly: map revelation shatters retrocognitive trap with felt cost ("searing reverie lingered like embers"). Causal lens holds through debris-message escalation without retroactive patches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon constrains choices (debris messages formed near its waters) and charges final image ("pondered the lagoon's depths"). Sensory hierarchy sharp: "blistering sand underfoot" reflects archivist's crisis urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally: each debris arrangement ("TRUTH" → "WHY BETRAY?" → "FORGIVE TO FREE") narrows options until forgiveness plea forces confession. Cost unmistakable in "reverie scorching his mind with unresolved pain."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "FEAR DIVIDED US" debris confession, not statement. Final image ("obsidian lagoon's depths") reweights premise as "solemn guardian of history's hidden fires" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: archivist's eye notices "spiral of conch shells" as code. Rhythmic control falters slightly in climax ("Tension mounted as visions...") but elision taught early via diary discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; "air tasted of salt and regret" achieves high density. Minor scaffold in "reverie burning hotter" repetition, but closure beat ("gasped amid swaying bookshelves") avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: nonverbal debris parley transforms civil rights betrayal trope. Risk-taking heightens stakes (kelp queries threatening burial) without gimmickry; "FEAR DIVIDED US" confession feels inevitable.</comment>
