<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority excels via worry stone dent embodying exile's cost, but motivation ("discover beauty") lacks concrete friction against banishment pain; no second character limits relationship crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost in "hopeful melancholy" reconfiguration, but "translating silence" method arrives past midpoint (40%), risking lens ambiguity for Accumulative design despite coherent pressure build.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Magnetic nexus constrains choices via moon-deadline pressure and pulls metal buttons, charging final image; auroras/compasses avoid cliché by actively shaping Elias's correlation attempts under duress.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation via nexus energy crescendo narrows options to "correlate or lose cycle," with cost legible in melancholy hope; dominant stake (redeeming silence) tightens through protagonist's active reweighting of past wounds.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete correlations (eclipse/dent = resilience), but final line's "beauty awaited those who translated quiet correlations" triggers thematic echo penalty for near-prompt moralizing, undermining earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines via chess-logic filtering magnetism ("pawns advancing toward queendom"), though "thoughtfully precise" repetition mildly dilutes rhythmic control during high-pressure correlation beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero figurative muddle in peak beats, but paraphrase loops ("silence of exile correlated to... silence of birdsong") deduct 0.2; strategic telling compresses backstory without scaffold, preserving propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of chess strategy with magnetic physics feels inevitable, but "exile seeking beauty" trope lacks fresh inflection beyond worry stone's dent; specificity in nexus mechanics elevates risk.</comment>
