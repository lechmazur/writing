<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in vibration over sound avoids therapy-speak; Elias’s micro-choice to layer songs shows hierarchy of values. Mira’s silent tears embody contradiction (grief/release), but minimal internal conflict in peak beats costs 0.3.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orientation solid by line 15 ("drum maker’s cavern...Elias the deaf music teacher"). Closure is Charged Poise: "filament of hush lingered" crystallizes cost of defeated numbness with conceptual weight. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) held impeccably through density escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cavern’s vibrations constrain choice (Elias feeling sound through floor) and charge final image ("echoing silently in every heart"). "Half-made drum" touched by Mira shifts from object to emotional conduit, satisfying 9+ gate. Sensory specificity avoids cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Elias’s agency: adjusting phonograph to "layer another backward song" deepens the hush that cracks Mira’s numbness. Cost is visceral ("tears tracing her cheeks without a sob") and scales perfectly to length. One decisive intensification suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges through "reversed lullabies" and drum-tapping—silence as connection—not moralizing. Final image ("filament of hush lingered") offers non-literal answer to emotional isolation. "Profound music of quietude" risks abstraction but is redeemed by embodied action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: sound described as "vibrations in cavern floor," "voice swallowed by fog." Rhythmic control in "reversed lullabies that sighed like wind through hollow reeds" modulates under pressure. Zero POV drift despite lyric density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "filament of hush" evolves meaningfully across beats. Final line’s "echoing silently" delivers conceptual cost cleanly. Minor deduction for "hushed cascades" / "hush of his own muted world" proximity (−0.2), but no closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms deafness trope through tactile sound physics. "Broken needle scraping erratically" feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Risk-taking (silence as protagonist’s medium) heightens stakes coherently. Fresh inflection in "web of silence that caught fleeting feelings."</comment>
