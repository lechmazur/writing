<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in ritual execution: rational forager logic (truffle selection) clashes with vulnerable truth-spilling ("It works... the relic shields me"). Final choice earned through embodied cost—storms continue despite "budding calm"—avoids tidy resolution while foreclosing reliance on discredited methods.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "graceful fracture had mended just enough" crystallizes reconfigured stakes with undeniable cost (ongoing storms). Orientation anchors by 45 words; Accumulative lens holds through storm density escalation that reweights psychological safety without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hanging orchard constrains choice actively—swaying bridges force precise footing, wind tears cloak during ritual. Glass eye charges final image ("pocketed the eye... steps lighter"). Micro-setting (truffle/rainwater mix) integrates action while avoiding postcard description; sensory hierarchy reflects forager's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Accumulative lens: storm fury intensifies ritual pressure, deepening resolve through sensory density ("vines creaking like symphony in discord"). Cost is unmistakable—"storms would continue" while safety remains "fractured"—reweighting psychological safety as fragile endurance rather than victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through concrete actions: "harvesting peace from chaos" metaphor crystallizes in final line without moralizing. Subtext in gesture—truth-spilling during ritual reveals tension between honesty and safety—avoiding thematic echo while offering resonant non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "rational forager" lens filters details (soil/scent calculations amid chaos). Rhythmic control under pressure—shorter syntax during lightning strike ("I must do this")—modulates voice without head-hopping. Purposeful elision (virus backstory) taught early and paid off in ritual stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts: "fractured grace" crystallizes closure without figurative muddle. Every sentence advances story ("boots sinking into mossy ropes" establishes setting/mood simultaneously). High density in ritual beat—truffle crushing/anointing—avoids overwriting while propelling toward Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms empathy trope: virus as psychological burden (not physical) reframed through rational forager's lens. "Occlude" as active safety mechanism feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric closure heightens stakes without gimmickry while maintaining conceptual integrity.</comment>
