<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "mended something... or perhaps unraveled it further" and the parasol's absurd utility. Final renunciation of passive surrender earns cost via visceral reality-slipping during the storm climax, though grandmother vision risks convenience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands impeccably: "Patience folded then... in release—a crease where waiting gave way to acceptance" crystallizes stance with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds through sensory deepening to the windborne sigh revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina functions as micro-setting—parasol tip's ice-probing directly constrains choices and charges the talisman reprise. Sensory hierarchy ("ozone of impending storms" over visual) reflects urgency while avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via protagonist agency: capsized boat intensifies her listening mission, narrowing options until the gale forces stance crystallization. Cost legible in "reality slipped entirely" during the storm, reweighting "approaching endings" from dread to solace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through parasol's transformation—from "fragile barrier against sun's glare" to trawling talisman. Final image ("beginning folded within") resonates without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo while reweighting euthanasia pursuit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("mind a vessel caught in wind's capricious currents") sustains altered-state diction under pressure. Rhythmic control shifts from languid ("reality slipped through fingers like melting snow") to staccato during capsized boat crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "windborne sigh, like breath over lace" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Figurative language ("patience woven thin") serves character without muddling the storm climax's visceral immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms euthanasia trope through Alaskan specificity and the parasol's irreplaceable function. "Fold in patience" concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightening emotional stakes coherently.</comment>
