<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied choices (Elias adjusting Clara's locket, Lira clutching the dying rose) rather than labels. Contradictory impulses—mourning vs. hope—drive the pivotal tattoo decision with felt cost. Slight thinness in Lira's backstory limits her micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: Lira departs transformed while Elias continues his solitary mission, with cost legible in "his hands stained with the ink of unsent letters." Accumulative lens holds through sensory density, though the curtain-parting mechanism feels slightly convenient without deeper constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tattoo stencil functions as micro-setting—its warmth and pulsing veins directly constrain Lira's choice and charge the final image where Elias embeds its fragment. Sensory details (starlit paper, comet light) are purposefully filtered through Elias's artisanal gaze without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Lira hesitates at the curtains, forcing Elias to deploy the stencil—a meaningful escalation driven by his agency. The cost (emotional vulnerability of tattooing) is visceral, though the observatory's rules slightly over-simplify the "purity of will" requirement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the vellum fragment in Elias's final jewelry reweights "artificial forms" as vessels for genuine renewal without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by letting the dying rose and pulsing stencil carry subtext about artifice and authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV voice remains distinct under pressure—"subdued ardor" lexicon reflects Elias's restrained passion through rhythmic cadence ("stars whispered secrets across eons"). Minor register drift occurs in "soul's hidden gardens," verging on thematic abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with minimal scaffold; "synthetic vellum that mimicked human skin" exemplifies textural specificity. Overwriting risk in "ethereal drapes woven from forgotten dreams" slightly muddles causality but is redeemed by the observatory's established lyric logic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes through specific, verifiable details: mourning jewelry from Clara's hair, coordinates in origami cranes. Emotional truth anchors the cosmic setting, though "curtains of intention" leans familiar without sufficient fresh inflection.</comment>
