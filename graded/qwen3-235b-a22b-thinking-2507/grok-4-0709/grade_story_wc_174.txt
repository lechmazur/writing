<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (elegant scripts vs. ethical doubts), but the epiphany lacks messy irrationality; Lena's departure as "catalyst" feels too neat without self-deception or hypocrisy in the pivotal shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("weight of ethical exploration settle like a quiet starfall"), but the causal leap from argument to reversal lacks one concrete trigger—what specific memory or detail finally cracks his denial?</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The campfire story stick functions as micro-setting, constraining choices and charging the final image, but the dome's atmospheric pressure never alters tactics beyond mood; needed one physical interaction (e.g., scraping knee on geodesic panel).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through reflection with visible conceptual cost, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven deepening; Lena's off-page words catalyze change without Elias actively wrestling with her accusation mid-scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete craft (calligraphy → puppetry), but "half-lit epiphanies" risks thematic echo; the final image reweights prior material without moralizing, though "reversing familiar myths" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("echoes lingered like forgotten signals") and rhythmic control under pressure, but "cosmic dust" and "quiet starfall" verge on overwriting in the reflection beat, diluting momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong propulsion overall, but synonym churn in the reflection paragraph ("cracked open doubts... revealing half-lit epiphanies—those partial revelations") creates a minor scaffold loop that dulls the pivotal turn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis (calligrapher-to-puppeteer using dome scraps) avoids tropes through specific details like marionettes carved from "salvaged dome scraps," though "seedy bars" slightly leans on convention without deeper transformation.</comment>
