<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "carefully reckless" manifests through quill work, but Thorne's shift lacks visible struggle; his skepticism resolves too easily without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with Thorne's "I see now" and ink well dimming, but cost remains abstract ("weight lifting like fog") without concrete on-page sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The glass ink well constrains every action (phonetic ink response) and charges the final image as it dims, fulfilling micro-setting requirement for 9+ band eligibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation relies on magical revelation rather than character agency; Thorne's change stems from symphony-induced visions, not his own choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (inscribed promises), but "truth's melody" borders on thematic echo; final image reweights "symphonies" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in linguistic focus ("crackling like autumn leaves"), but "cautious exuberance" repetition creates syntactic monotony under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Overwriting in "ethereal harmonies woven from extinct dialects" obscures causality; mixed metaphor ("bubbling as promises fused") dulls closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistic magic with trust restoration; "glass ink well" transforms trope through specific mechanics that charge the closure image.</comment>
