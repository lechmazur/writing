<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Motivation ("witness without judgment") remains abstract and untested under pressure; no contradictory impulses or flawed choices emerge despite high-stakes observation. Keeper's actions follow ritual without micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values, reducing interiority to thematic labeling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: keeper's return to the library crystallizes his eternal cycle with conceptual cost ("fractures in his loosely gripped reality" mended by silence). Accumulative lens holds as seasonal observations deepen purpose without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Obsidian refuge functions as micro-setting that charges closure: its erosion under river's lap mirrors keeper's "crumbling peace," while the origami swan's physical folds constrain the portal choice. Sensory details (river's mirror, whispering shadows) evolve with plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("witness change") with no concrete pressure testing commitment; keeper faces zero opposition or trade-offs during observations. Escalation lacks deepening—seasons drift without altering tactics—rendering "burrowing deeper" a hollow intensifier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the swan's recurring folds and river's reflections, avoiding moralizing. But keeper's unchallenged neutrality prevents authentic tension between "witnessing" and emotional engagement, leaving thematic resonance unearned despite the final "impartial dance" image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinct perceptual signature ("vines cradling tomes that whispered secrets," "cryptic folds twisted like riddles") with rhythmic control through transitions. Lyric compression taught early pays off in closure, though stress moments lack syntactic compression expected under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose excels in textural specificity ("obsidian slowly eroded under the river's gentle lap") but suffers paraphrase loops: "cryptic folds" repeats four times with minimal variation, and "regenerative silence" appears verbatim thrice, dulling momentum in mid-beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Synthesizes familiar "eternal observer" tropes with origami symbolism, but paper-folding civilization echo feels decorative rather than transformative. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens coherence, yet avoids bold choices about the keeper's emotional cost.</comment>
