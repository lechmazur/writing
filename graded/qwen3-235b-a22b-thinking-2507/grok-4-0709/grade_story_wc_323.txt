<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied details like "heart ached with somber marvel" and micro-choices (meticulous testing), avoiding label-only emotions. Motivation rooted in instructor role and surface-world loss feels authentic, though internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses beyond professional dedication. Final vow earns endurance with visible grief cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (causal setup/accumulative payoff) holds: experiment deepens into Charged Poise closure where "profound quiet of achievement mingled with grief" crystallizes stakes. Orientation clear by para 1. Minor deduction: simulation succeeds without meaningful obstacle escalation before the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Benthic city isn't backdrop—hydrothermal vents "illuminate habitats like submerged stars," directly charging the starlight navigation quest. Chain link (micro-setting) constrains choices as geometric scaffold, culminating in the final image where "holographic stars" reconfigure the city's reality with cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mastering starlight navigation) tightens via one deepening beat: simulation success reveals emotional cost ("beauty born of loss"). Agency clear but pressure lacks escalation—Elias faces no tangible opposition beyond meticulous calibration, weakening the tightening required for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the chain link's symbolism and "somber marvel" tone—no moralizing. Final vow ("honor the balance") reweights the premise by accepting fragility, while avoiding false equivalence about humanity's lost surface world. Grief charges the closure without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "geometric perfection: the curved edges forming an endless cycle" reflects Elias's instructor mindset. Rhythmic control deepens under pressure ("simulation hummed to life... projection bloomed outward"), though "balancedly curious" feels slightly clinical mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "profound quiet of achievement mingled with grief" avoids sentimentality with concrete specificity. Minor deduction: "somber glow" borders cliché in high-pressure beat, slightly dulling immediacy without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deep-sea sci-fi with navigation philosophy—aliens enable conceptual expansion, not action tropes. The chain link transforms from relic to thematic engine, making the "unfolded horizons" concept feel inevitable. Risk-taking (quiet climax) heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
