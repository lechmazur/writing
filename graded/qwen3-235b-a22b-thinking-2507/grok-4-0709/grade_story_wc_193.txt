<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (trauma vs hope) with embodied micro-choices like rigging the lever "playfully taunting," but parallel selves' urgency lacks deeper exploration of fear beneath the "spark of mischievous virtue." Final diamond-sharing earns closure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Decisive Change lands cleanly: bolt twist compresses pressure into diamonds with unmistakable cost ("pressure mounted, squeezing her"). Orientation anchors by word 20. Minor flaw—bolt retrieval feels slightly facile despite lever improvisation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bioluminescent mushrooms function as micro-setting: spores become suit, migrate to wreck, and final bloom charges closure. Recurring object (bolt) constrains choice via lever rigging, exceeding 9+ gate by shaping tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency: glitchy messages → dive → pressure squeeze → bolt twist. Cost unmistakable in physical/metaphorical pressure, but "virtuously mischievous" trait isn’t sufficiently tested—spore-sharing lacks real risk stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete alchemy: pressure→diamonds, shared wealth. Final image ("story from ruin to radiance") reweights trauma without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by showing redemption through action, not assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mushrooms' glow intensified," "velvet cloak" of shadowseam) with rhythmic control. Minor abstraction slip: "virtuously mischievous" told not shown during bolt retrieval, slightly dulling peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; "pressure mounted, physical and metaphorical" does double duty. Final line crystallizes theme without muddle. Hairline flaw: "resonant click" slightly clichéd amid otherwise precise propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: quantum promises as physical vows, trauma→diamonds grounded in mushroom farm logistics. "Shadowseam wonder" transforms tropes coherently—risk-taking (parallel selves) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
