<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation remains abstract despite clear setup; no contradictory impulses or visible cost in closure choice. Interiority lacks embodied struggle during decoding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lacks legible cost: "savoring dawn's promise" avoids stakes. Lens ambiguity persists past midpoint despite Accumulative/Textural lean. Orientation clear but cost proof fails.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Golden arcade constrains choices via chalk dust permanence vs. holograms. Ebony clipboard charges final image when pocketing chalk. Micro-setting drives decoding tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>No escalation: children's chalk is tool not opposition. Stakes remain abstract despite "corporate overreach" mention. Pressure never tests commitment to margin-discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through chalk/hologram juxtaposition but final image lacks non-literal answer. "Guardian of forgotten arts" borders on thematic echo without earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "synthetic gold" and "chalk dust underfoot" observations. Voice modulates effectively though late reflection slightly dilutes present tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "deliberate pace of yesteryear" / "deliberate act" repetition. High density otherwise with rhythmic control in dawn sequences. No closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of analog/digital tension via pseudonym craft, but emotional stakes lack specificity. "Charged whispers" transforms trope but avoids meaningful risk.</comment>
