<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "compassion had blinded him" versus tempered empathy, with embodied cost in peeling forged permits. "Shedding layers" phrasing risks abstraction but saved by concrete actions like journal revisions. Micro-choices during chameleon feeding ground the final shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with "convictions no longer fragile but resilient" at dawn, carrying conceptual cost of permanent vigilance. Accumulative lens holds through mist-to-pink-sky progression. No causality breaks; orientation anchored by word 40 with vivid workshop specificity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Workshop functions as micro-setting: starlight on tail tip constrains reflection, peeling papers reveals scarred wood mirroring resolve. Final image of "talisman of reconstruction" charged by prior resin-hued details. Avoids symbolism by making mist an active pressure during clearing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake crystallizes when Elias tends live chameleon—"compassion in action, balanced with self-respect"—narrowing options through present-moment choice. Agency drives escalation via journal revisions and permit-peeling. Cost legible in "naive trust stripped away" without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tail tip's evolution from "relic" to "talisman," avoiding moralizing. Final line reweights "balance" as earned through concrete acts, not abstraction. Chameleon's adaptation metaphor integrates organically with Elias' shedding of illusions during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: professional attention to animal behavior ("eyes swiveling independently") blends with emotional vulnerability. Rhythm modulates from short sentences during clearing to lyrical flow in reflection. Zero register drift despite high-stakes interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Minor synonym loop in "shimmering stillness" (x3) deducts 0.2. Otherwise flawless propulsion: "peeled them from walls, layer by layer" shows concrete action. Final line's "balance was within reach" avoids abstraction through physical talisman placement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms wildlife-handler trope via psychological aftermath focus. Tail tip's evolution from severed relic to adaptive symbol feels inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off through charged final image without gimmickry or abstraction.</comment>
