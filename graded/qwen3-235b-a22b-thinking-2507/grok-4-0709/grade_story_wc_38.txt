<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear but lacks contradictory impulses in action; "calm defiance" presented as consistent trait without visible struggle against fear during key moments like dice rolls.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost ("vulnerabilities encrypted as strength"), but cost proof is oblique—no exact line shows sacrificed option beyond abstract transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sunken lab’s water pressure and debris actively constrain choices (e.g., shallow pools for dancing); dice and journal function as micro-settings charging the final image with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape via dice algorithm) lacks escalation—no narrowing of options or rising cost; static conflict where success feels inevitable without failed attempts or environmental pressure intensification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</comment><question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "buoyant strength" reconfiguration, but resolution avoids complexity—vulnerability-to-strength arc resolves symmetrically without lingering ambiguity or competing costs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lyrical code breaker" lens) with rhythmic control, though "calm defiance" repetition creates subtle template cadence in high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and vivid imagery, but adjacent-line synonym churn ("calm defiance" x4, "mysterious familiarity" echoes) dulls immediacy in closure beats without strategic variation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dance-as-cipher feels inevitable, but risk-taking remains safe—avoids bold choices like failed rolls or corrupted journal entries that would heighten stakes coherently.</comment>
