<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority richly embodied ("featherly determined spirit—light as down") but lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal moments; epiphany earned yet no visible trade-offs during wood-grain analysis constrain the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: "sacredness arose from the hush before crossing" reweights thresholds with felt cost of transformed identity; Accumulative/Textural lens held through density shift when logbook aligns with wood grain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism terrace constrains method (worn table for grain analysis) and charges final image ("prisms casting elongated shadows"); micro-setting as environment shapes every tactical choice toward closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via logbook/wood-grain pattern recognition, but escalation lacks tangible trade-offs; "necessary distances" concept tightens meaning yet cost remains conceptual without dramatized forfeiture of prior coping mechanisms.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (maze thresholds, logbook codes), avoiding moralizing; final line "sacred whispers echoing in fractured hush" reweights premise without stating morals, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "prismatic edges fracturing sunlight into rainbows that danced like whispers"; rhythmic control shifts with emotional intensity while maintaining Accumulative/Textural pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor overwriting ("unraveled the threads of their lives like a butterfly's wing stirring a storm" risks mixed metaphor) but zero closure artifacts; high density maintained except brief thematic echo in "necessary distances" section.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms maze archetype through "necessary distances" concept; prism terrace and logbook codes synthesize into fresh emotional calculus where loss becomes sacred—bold specificity avoids middle-ground hedging.</comment>
