<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shown through embodied actions (prying floorboards, testing map with leaf) rather than labels; motivation for finding lost conversations drives every choice. Minor lack of contradictory impulses before vault entry slightly softens the 9+ threshold.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: "tears welled as the conversation replayed, mending the parched voids in her soul" crystallizes emotional reconfiguration. Causal lens holds perfectly—map discovery → testing → vault revelation with unbroken linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Gilded leaves function as micro-setting that constrains choices (map testing via wilting trait) and charges the final image ("reclaimed honesty"). Hydro-tunnels' "drip of condensation" concretely mirrors emotional residue without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Elara tests the map with the gilded leaf—the frond's "vibrant, uncurled" state forecloses deception as an option. Emotional cost ("mended parched voids") legible in the vault scene under causal escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of "greenhouse city... might yet flourish with reclaimed honesty" reweights candor as active preservation, not passive idealism. No thematic echo—insight emerges solely from sonic orb mechanics and Elara's visceral reaction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in humidity "clinging like unspoken regrets" and vines as "veins under toxic sky." Consistent first-person texture avoids filter verbs; stress compresses diction appropriately during vault discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop in "reclaimed honesty" echoes; "tears welled" borders on label-only feeling. Otherwise high density—bioluminescent vines both set scene and illuminate map assembly without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: truth-detecting leaves transform dystopian trope into emotional mechanics. Risk-taking in quiet closure (no antagonist) heightens stakes through specificity of "zinc-etched postal plate" and sonic archives.</comment>
