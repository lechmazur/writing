<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices: "affectionate detachment" manifests in tender page-turning versus ritual destruction, with grief and hope layered in "eyes misting" at sixth floor. No label-speak; micro-choices like preserving the diary reveal hierarchy of values under cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: defying the ritual ("chose to preserve it") forecloses release path with conceptual cost crystallized in "keeper of encrypted light." Accumulative lens holds—each floor’s revelation density tightens options under consistent pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The icebound spire functions as micro-setting: refraction mechanics enable the entire revelation process, constraining Elias’s decoding method. Final image "encrypted light" charges the environment’s purpose, transforming ice from barrier to meaning-carrier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (joy beneath anguish) tightens through Elias’s agency—decoding choices escalate pressure floor by floor. Conceptual cost is unmistakable in his renunciation of the ritual, reweighting his ascent as "keeper" rather than servant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the diary’s evolving revelations, not statement. Final image "encrypted light" resonates as non-literal answer—joy persists within anguish without moralizing, avoiding sentimentality through concrete particulars like stargazing confessions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Elias notices "prisms like elusive fireflies" through his inquisitive lens. Rhythmic control accelerates with the elevator’s ascent ("Sixth floor: the diary’s core unfolded"), compressing time without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels revelation. "Brittle cover carefully" shows rather than tells, and final phrase "encrypted light" crystallizes concept without muddle. Figurative language serves pressure, as in "edges curled like forgotten secrets."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms diary trope through specific mechanics: scattered light isn’t decorative but essential to decoding. Risk-taking in quiet Earned Stasis closure heightens stakes—preserving joy bears conceptual weight without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
