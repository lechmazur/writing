<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s internal conflict—luminous yet rejecting enhancements—drives her pilgrimage design and culminates in her earned shift from skepticism to acceptance when holding the amber, with embodied cost ("glow pulsed faintly" during doubt).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: the fly amber’s chemistry reframes homecoming as universal, with conceptual cost in Elara relinquishing rigid skepticism ("convergence wasn’t forced but inevitable"), under a coherent Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rainwashed tower and spring setting actively constrain choices—the dusty footprints enabled by rain guide her path—and charge the closure as filtered light illuminates "glowing forms," reweighting Earth’s pull amid alien integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara’s agency: following footprints escalates organic convergence, narrowing her artificial pilgrimage into a catalyst for real bonds, with conceptual cost in her skepticism’s collapse during the amber’s revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly via the amber’s chemistry mirroring neurotransmitters; the final image reweights "artificial pilgrimage" as proof of inevitable earthly bonds without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bronze quiet," "luminous skeptic") persists under pressure; rhythmic control varies with emotional intensity, and the Accumulative lens is taught early via sensory accumulation without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "dusty footprints emerging ahead, as if imprinted by invisible travelers" exemplifies high-density imagery, though slight repetition in "glistening" surfaces risks minor scaffold but avoids closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of "chemistry of homecoming" via amber science transforms first-contact tropes; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable through prior particulars.</comment>
