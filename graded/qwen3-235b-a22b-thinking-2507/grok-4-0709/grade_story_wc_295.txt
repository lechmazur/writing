<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to decode inscriptions for shared burdens is clear and embodied through observatory rituals, but Thorne's sudden appearance lacks prior causality for their connection. Micro-choices like dimming lights to enter dreams reveal values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: "Burden shared, dawn breaks eternal" crystallizes stance with visible cost (years of isolation). Orientation anchors by line 15; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through variable star rhythms reweighting the burden theme.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Observatory brass fittings and telegraph constrain choices—Elara uses star charts as dream anchors and the telegram to initiate action. Final image of them mapping stars together charges closure, fulfilling 9+ gate via micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Thorne's telegram ("Burden too heavy alone"), narrowing Elara's options to shared decoding. Cost is visceral: his "fractured" voice and years of solitary struggle directly alter her tactics, driving agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—variable stars as burden metaphors—without moralizing. Final image of shared mapping offers resonant answer to "how burdens lighten," avoiding thematic echo despite "healing words" phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: astronomer's precision ("variable stars pulsed like distant heartbeats") modulates under stress. No head-hopping; tension in dream dialogue carries subtext ("Share my burden" vs. "let me carry half the load").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in reflective block ("As a lucid dream chronicler...") and two paraphrase loops ("chronicle the lucid dreams that visited her like faithful companions"/"recording visions that revealed hidden truths") dull momentum without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms "scholarly quest" trope via specific burden mechanics (variable stars as shared-light metaphors). Emotional truth in isolation-to-connection arc avoids generic templates, though daylily symbolism borders on familiar.</comment>
