<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "calibrated treason" vs. "forgive the unfinished," embodied through thorn/key mechanics. Flaws: Silas's off-page absence limits relationship crucible despite strong micro-choices at the vault.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands via Charged Poise—"weight lift from her soul" crystallizes forgiveness with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds through drip motif, but "calibrated precision" slightly over-explains the dissolution moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Marble sanctuary constrains choice: aurora light refracted through veins enables unlocking. Pearl twilight charges final image ("thorns turned to purpose"), fulfilling 9+ gate via micro-setting pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through agency—Elara's reflection at the vault tightens emotional pressure. Cost is legible in "unlinking from past," but "calibrated treason" concept lacks visceral urgency in peak beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through thorn motif's reprise: "pricks of conscience" to "thorns turned to purpose." Final image answers central question without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels—calligrapher's light/texture focus ("veined stone," "iridescent hues"). Minor register drift in "calibrated precision" slightly jars in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with resonant imagery, but "calibrated precision" echoes "calibrated treason" creating subtle synonym churn in closure beat. No fatal artifacts, yet propulsion softens slightly there.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms forgery trope via marble/aurora mechanics; emotional specificity in forgiveness-as-completion avoids cliché. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry, meeting 9+ quick test.</comment>
