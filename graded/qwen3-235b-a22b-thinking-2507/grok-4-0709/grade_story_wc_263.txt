<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; motivation clear but "soul wither into oblivion" edges toward diagnostic label-speak. Strength: embodied sextant use ("cool metal kissing her skin") grounds emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with visible cost (creativity surge after "bird in cage" suppression), but "unwritten calendar" timeframe fails to tighten decisions. Accumulative lens holds through meteor-tracing pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sextant functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (precise adjustments) and charges final image ("lowered her arms, utterly at rest"). Archway description lacks tactical pressure despite "humming stones" potential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency (tracing stars) under Accumulative lens with felt cost ("layer of exhaustion peeled away"). Meteor shower deepening reweights stakes, but "unwritten calendar" doesn't concretely alter tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "remembered stardust" realization without moralizing; final image ("touched the infinite") resonates non-literally. Avoids thematic echo by embedding insight in meteor-tracing action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("veils danced like forgotten promises") but "shadowed rapture" repetition creates subtle register drift. Rhythmic control falters in high-pressure beats with near-synonym loops.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Shadowed rapture" appears 3x with paraphrase loops (-0.3); "unspoken words" repetition lacks pattern-teaching. Strong verbs ("whirring softly," "birthing poems") offset density issues in non-closure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Transforms stargazing trope via sextant mechanics and "hearing unspoken words" attribute. Emotional specificity in creativity blockage elevates common "cosmic connection" premise, but stardust concept lacks fresh inflection.</comment>
