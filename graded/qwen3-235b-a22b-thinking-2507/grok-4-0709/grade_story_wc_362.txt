<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Marcus's transformation lacks embodied contradiction; his shift from skeptic to believer happens too abruptly without layered emotional struggle. Elara's micro-choices (tracing frost, prism handling) effectively reveal her "truthful lies" methodology, but Marcus remains underdeveloped despite pivotal presence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: Marcus's gasp/touch crystallizes the emotional residue concept with visible cost ("assumptions shattering further"). Accumulative lens holds throughout—sensory density (thickening mist, frost patterns) tightens pressure without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quartz arbor constrains choices: mist enables prism refraction, frost patterns dictate Elara's method. Final image ("mist parted") recharges the setting with cost, fulfilling 9+ gate. Mist's evolution from "clung like forgotten secrets" to parting mirrors Marcus's emotional shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Marcus's escalating engagement: mocking → leaning closer → gasping → touching. Cost ("shattered assumptions") is visceral and on-page. Agency lies in Elara's method driving the deepening, though Marcus's internal shift feels slightly rushed in the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through frost patterns as emotional residue; final image ("mist parted") resonates without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—wisdom arises from concrete particulars ("lightening our own if we only listen" implied through action, not stated).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's perceptual signature shines ("mossy earth despite ethereal haze"), but "truthful lies" concept borders on over-explanation. Marcus's dialogue carries subtext ("mocking even as he begged"), though rhythmic control dips slightly in explanatory beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless density: "mist clung to crystalline branches like forgotten secrets" does triple duty. Minor deduction for "shifted hush" repetition (4x)—not scaffold but edges toward loop, slightly dulling closure's final impact despite strong propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "objects absorb emotions" trope via frost-pattern mechanics and "truthful lies" methodology. Risk: Accumulative structure in short form succeeds through sensory specificity. Freshness in prism/frost interplay avoids derivative pitfalls.</comment>
