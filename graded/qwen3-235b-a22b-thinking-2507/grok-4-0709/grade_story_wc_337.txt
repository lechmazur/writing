<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete ("lucid unrest churned within her like a storm seen through clear glass") and motivation intensifies as knots unravel, but contradictory impulses lack simultaneous tension during the climax; guilt surfaces too late to inform the final choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: spirits settling "like sediment" with visible cost in Elara's delayed guilt admission ("she had known the secret from old letters"). Accumulative lens holds as silence density increases until the net dissolves.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary constrains choice—starlight fractures visions during unraveling—and charges closure via "prismatic light" mending the mask. Micro-setting (tapestry needle) alters tactics when piercing resistant knots.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elara's agency under Accumulative lens: each knot unraveled deepens silence-release pressure. Cost unmistakable in her trembling hands and "fear[ing] the unrest it would unleash" during the central betrayal reveal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the net's "interlaced hush" reweights truth-telling as both burden and release. Final image ("mask mended itself") offers resonant answer without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("shadows that seemed to breathe"), rhythm modulates with pressure via fragmented phrasing during knot-unraveling. Backstory anchored to mask/net cues avoids reflection-led mode pitfalls.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold, but "lucid unrest" recurs 4× without evolution in peak beats, slightly muddling emotional specificity. Final line ("purpose fulfilled") risks tell-over-show yet avoids closure dulling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prism physics with spirit lore; "interlaced hush" transforms familiar tropes. Emotional specificity in delayed guilt avoids templates, though generational shame arc feels slightly familiar.</comment>
