<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interiority in weighing the sea glass ("Was this enough to atone?") reveals contradictory impulses, but backstory about scorching souls remains summarily told without embodied cost during polishing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (burden of intentions), but repetitive "memories resurfaced" scaffold dilutes the climax's pressure despite valid Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Grotto actively constrains choices (mist as polishing dew, serpentine walls mirroring tension), though "hidden seas" scent lacks causal integration beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stake tightening at the scale scene forecloses fire-based redemption with visible cost, but escalation lacks intensification of the "fiery descents" backstory into present pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sea glass transformation ("light endured without flame"), yet "pearl of stillness" leans toward stated concept rather than earned moral complexity in the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual rhythm mirrors polishing ("deliberate and rhythmic"), but "ashen regrets" during high-pressure weighing feels like stock phrasing disrupting stress compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Memories resurfaced" verbatim repetition creates paraphrase loop in closure beat; final-third artifacts disallow 9+ globally despite otherwise strong textural specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic fall myth with gem polishing elevates trope, though "zephyr bloom" leans on familiar lyric cadence without sufficient transformation.</comment>
