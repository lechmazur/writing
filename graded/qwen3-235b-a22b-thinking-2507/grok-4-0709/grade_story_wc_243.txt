<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "haunted euphoria" and "tears of haunted bliss," embodying grief-joy fusion through micro-choices like opening the locket. Final choice earned by causality, but Mira's absence limits relationship crucible despite thematic depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost ("tears of haunted bliss," "euphoric haunting") under Accumulative lens. Ritual steps build density toward crystallization, though cost remains emotional without tangible forfeiture beyond tears.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Jetty functions as micro-setting: pollen heightens "mystical charge," salt water enables ink bath. Final image ("flowers bloomed brighter") charges closure by reweighting the sanctuary, fulfilling 9+ gate through tool constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stake ("preserve small moments") tightens via twilight timeframe forcing ritual action. Escalation driven by agency (steeping photo), but cost—while felt—is purely emotional without visible tradeoff like lost time or resources.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "steeped in loss and rediscovery," avoiding moralizing. Final line ("forever guardian of the ephemeral") offers resonant, non-literal answer reweighting covenant, though "regenerated" slightly overstates renewal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("bruised purples," "joyous ache laced with spectral whispers") filters details through archivist's lens. Rhythm shifts from measured ritual steps to lyrical euphoria without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "diluted the ink with jetty water, stirring until..." exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Minor deduction: "proximate causes" repetition (3x) slightly dilutes momentum in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms mourning trope via archival ritual—walnut ink steeping feels fresh, specific. Emotional truth in "gently thorough" grief, though jetty setting edges toward lyrical cliché without deeper constraint.</comment>
