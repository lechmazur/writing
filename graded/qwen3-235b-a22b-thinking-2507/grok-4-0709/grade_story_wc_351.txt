<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority relies on diagnostic label-speak ("synaptic plasticity," "quantum threads") during crisis beats, violating emotional authenticity; micro-choices lack tangible stakes despite strong embodied tremors in the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands under Accumulative lens, but cost remains abstract (trembling hands lack concrete forfeiture); seismic "urging" undermines pressure escalation by resolving inner turmoil through coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Canyon quakes effectively mirror psychological turmoil, yet setting functions as passive atmosphere rather than constraining choice; moonlight's role in mirror reflections charges the dawn payoff but lacks tactical impact during memory work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stakes remain intellectualized without visceral escalation; seismic "intensification" feels coincidental rather than pressure-driven, failing to narrow options or force trade-offs despite clear dominant stake of dream excavation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Thematic echo in penultimate line ("power of modification through the mind's resilient plasticity") explicitly states the moral, violating earned resonance; helix metaphor lacks integration with concrete choices to avoid abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("helix-minded," "chaotically precise") shines early but collapses into clinical diction during high-pressure memory modification, disrupting POV plausibility when an engineer in crisis cites neural terminology.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Overwriting cripples climax: "shattered yet capable of chaotically precise insights" and "rocks shifting like neurons firing" create mixed metaphors that obscure cause/effect; three consecutive filter-verb stacks in memory sequence dull immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Familiar "healing through science metaphors" trope lacks fresh synthesis; broken mirror concept shows ingenuity but derivative emotional arc (self-doubt to rebirth) avoids bold risks that heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
