<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction under trauma lacks simultaneous tension; "haggard awe" label repeats without embodied conflict. Strength: micro-choice of brooch exchange reveals hierarchy of values (art vs. connection) with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: brooch handover crystallizes "meaning through connection" with conceptual cost (relinquishing artifact for narrative fuel). Accumulative lens holds through density of converging artifacts; cost legible in "tell me her story" exchange.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tidal island micro-setting actively constrains choices (tide-dependent paths, storm-uncovered relics) and charges final image ("canvases capturing the brooch's glow amid converging storms"). Brooch as recurring object shifts from personal relic to shared-history catalyst.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (threshing meaning) tightens through artifact convergence, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—rain trails and Mira's arrival rely on coincidence. Cost (brooch exchange) visible, yet pressure grows texturally rather than through Elias's choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through brooch's evolving significance: "threshing beauty from wars' bitter harvest" reweights premise without moralizing. Final image charges closure by transforming "amber brooch" from loss-symbol to collaborative meaning-maker.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: painter notices light ("amber in lightning's flash") and texture ("squelching mud"). Voice modulates under stress ("absurd yet fitting" wryness) without syntactic collapse; Mira's dialogue carries ironic wonder distinct from Elias's interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("haggard awe" x3) and filter verbs in high-pressure beats dull immediacy. Strength: rhythmic control in storm sequence ("rain hammered... rivulets snaking") avoids overwriting; final line cliché ("bitter harvest") barely escapes penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "tidal convergence" trope through painter's "threshing" metaphor. Emotional specificity in insomnia-as-"endless canvases" avoids generic trauma; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
