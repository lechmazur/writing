<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in timeline choices (love vs power, solitude vs connection), embodied through physical light/dark shifts; final forgiveness earned by layered failures without therapy-speak; "periodically eternal" flaw drives every attempt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost: "touched ground for the first time, mortal, free" crystallizes the cyclical struggle; Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of failed timelines tightens pressure toward the child confrontation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Viaduct’s glow actively constrains choice—dimming with each timeline’s failure and charging the final image; raindrop’s suspended fall creates tangible time pressure that alters tactics mid-beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single tightening through procedural branches narrows options relentlessly; "periodically eternal" trade-off (isolation’s burden) visibly alters tactics in solitude timeline, with mortality as undeniable cost at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete failures of love/power/solitude branches; final image reweights "gravity-defying curse" as liberation without stating a moral, avoiding thematic echo through embodied action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "periodically eternal" lexicon and procedural metaphors; rhythmic compression under stress ("Desperation mounted; the raindrop teetered") modulates perfectly with escalating pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "tablet cracking under strain" metaphor maintains coherence through climax; final line "mortal, free" achieves maximum density without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms time-loop tropes via procedural generation mechanics; risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes organically, with "labyrinth of self" synthesized into inevitable emotional core.</comment>
