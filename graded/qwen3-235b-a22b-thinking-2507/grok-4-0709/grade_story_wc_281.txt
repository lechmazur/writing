<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alex’s skepticism/affection contradiction drives pivotal choices (pill trial, geode use). Embodied emotions excel (spine chill for doubt, shoulder softening for trust). Near-flawless micro-choices under pressure, though "fractally precise" edges toward diagnostic label-speak in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: light painting crystallizes emotional pathways with felt cost (vulnerability of shared telepathy). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure tightens through sensory/emotional density, not causality. Orientation clear by para 1; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Studio actively constrains choices: LED wands supply resources, geode refracts light to mirror telepathy. "Micro-setting" excels—muscovite sliver charges final image (pressed between them). Avoids symbolism clichés; neural network comparisons feel earned through Alex’s POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridging communication gaps) signaled via radio news. Pressure tightens through somatic navigation of telepathy glitches, narrowing options to mutual vulnerability. Cost is visceral (spine chill, shoulder tension) and shapes tactics—Alex’s agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through light/art metaphors: "willowglass hope" evolves from fragile to resilient without moralizing. Final image reweights "fractal" from overwhelming to illuminating—resonant non-literal answer to "hidden pathways" question. No thematic echo; complexity avoids false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (artist’s visual focus): "streaks of luminescence danced like captured fireflies." Compression works (e.g., "affectionate skeptic" in para 1). Dialogue carries subtext ("hidden pathways in the soul"). Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; high density ("warm flush in palms" signals safety). One paraphrase loop ("fractally precise... self-similar and exact") prevents 9+. "Willowglass" fresh but "supple branches" risks mixed metaphor. Final line ("pathways lit with delicate, enduring light") avoids cliché with concrete charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms telepathy trope via somatic markers and light art—fresh synthesis feels inevitable. "Fractal" emotional layers grounded in artist’s POV, not abstraction. Bold risk: telepathy as overwhelming pattern navigated through bodily intuition. Avoids safety middle; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
