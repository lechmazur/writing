<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "quiet blaze" tension—grief both illuminated and un-consumed—but emotional cost lacks visceral specificity at climax; "transformed grief into acceptance" remains conceptual without embodied sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the stillpoint’s silence reconfigures emotional stakes with undeniable conceptual cost ("grief transformed into acceptance"), under Accumulative/Textural lens with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest functions as active constraint—skin absorbing languages enables navigation, moss roots guide steps—and charges the final image ("carried its melodies within"), meeting 9+ gate for environment shaping closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation via sensory density (vibrations → musical trail → stillpoint) narrows options under Accumulative lens, but cost remains internalized; a physical forfeiture (e.g., ring’s warmth lost) would sharpen stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically through tactile particulars (moss, bark resonance), avoiding moralizing—but "emotional depths" abstraction slightly dilutes the final resonance’s concrete aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful: ultrasonic world filtered through touch/skin-absorption creates distinct voice; rhythmic control intensifies pressure during dowsing without elision penalties.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, yet "shores of unresolved longing" strains metaphor coherence in a high-pressure beat, slightly dulling the grief-storm’s visceral charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Blind mapmaker absorbing languages via skin transforms grief tropes through specific, sensory-driven mechanics—though "stillpoint" concept edges toward familiar spiritual resolution without full novelty.</comment>
