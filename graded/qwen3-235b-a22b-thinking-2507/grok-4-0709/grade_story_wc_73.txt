<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Grim optimist" motivation is clear but "balancedly daring" phrasing feels diagnostic rather than embodied, slightly undermining contradiction in peak beats; missed opportunity texture earned through math struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Decisive Change lands with conceptual cost (freedom as potential illusion), but math proof's rupture feels slightly convenient despite thematic justification; causal lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Infinite staircase functions as micro-setting through dice landings and step-flattening climax, but environment doesn't actively constrain early choices; chipped die charges final image strongly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through math attempts with escalating conceptual cost; Elias' agency drives rupture via chipped die's imperfection, making "texture of regret" viscerally legible in final tremor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from dice flaws and math proofs without moralizing; final image ("warm die in hand") reweights perpetual motion as human-scale imperfection rather than abstract concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in math descriptions, but "balancedly daring" phrasing creates register drift; rhythmic control strong except for academic diction in proof sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops around "balancedly daring" and math terminology; otherwise high density with clean propulsion, though "fading ink" detail slightly scaffolds closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mathematical rigor and emotional texture elevates staircase trope; chipped die as rupture catalyst transforms regret into tangible physics with bold conceptual risk.</comment>
