<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's "confidently uncertain" trait manifests in signal-tuning micro-choices and the pen ritual, with regret/comfort tension driving her revision. No diagnostic label-speak despite high-stakes editing; embodied cost in "alarms quieted" forecloses escape.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: tendrils withering retroactively proves timeline alteration. Hybrid lens (Causal for pen mechanics, Accumulative for signal symphony) holds through "resonant click" to final smile, reweighting stakes via felt consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gravitational anomaly constrains every choice—from inverted raindrops to pen-siphoned probability—and charges the closure as "strange comfort deepens." Meteorite pen functions as micro-setting, its fractal nib directly enabling the history edit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's agency: broadcasting her blunder to nebula signals directly triggers the pen's awakening. Cost is visceral in "tendrils withering," narrowing options from panicked regret to active revision under Hybrid lens pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Thresh meaning from experience" emerges through concrete actions—seed error, signal confession, pen revision—without moralizing. Final image of her "smiling, ready for signals" reweights the premise as learning, not erasure, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>Distinct voice crystallizes in "time feel like taffy" and "cosmic contingencies," with stress compressing diction during the pen ritual. No POV leakage; "confidently uncertain" phrasing stays character-particular via signal-interpreting actions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; "fractal patterns mimicking cosmic webs" shows textural specificity. Minor overwriting in "whispers from the cosmos" (redundant with "radio waves") dulls momentum but doesn’t obscure closure’s pen-unbending beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms time-editing trope through "contingent relationships" mechanics—cosmic signals as editing tools—making the pen's probability-siphoning feel inevitable. Emotional specificity in "bonds formed in shared crises" avoids generic regret.</comment>
