<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s motivation ("to appreciate hidden effort") drives micro-choices like tracing moon paths and tea preparation, with contradictions ("demure audacity") embodied in actions. Final vow to teach villagers earns closure through prior causality, though epiphany lacks sufficient struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost: fireflies fading ("deepening night") crystallizes impermanence while Elias descends "spirit alight," reconfiguring his quest. Accumulative lens holds via moon paths guiding to alcove, but minor causality gap in whistle’s sudden impulse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bamboo whisk constrains choice (tea ritual) and charges closure when "tucked away," its worn tines mirroring net-mending. Whispering parapet’s rain-carved grooves directly reveal hidden patterns, fulfilling micro-setting gate for 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (appreciating hidden labor vs. village pragmatism) tightens via fireflies’ "somber scintillation" and moon paths, with whistle as key turn. Cost (impermanence) is legible but lacks visceral weight; agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens nearly hits 8.8+ band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: tea bubbles mirroring net repairs, "mending soul’s frayed edges" insight. Final image ("spirit alight... secrets now partly his own") offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("scintillatingly somber glow," "wind slipped through cracks like secrets") with rhythmic control; compression ("boiling water... grinding green leaves") taught early. No head-hopping, lexicon stays within Elias’s philosophical yet tactile POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; high density ("whorls and eddies, mirroring the nets") with clear propulsion. Minor figurative muddle in "sparkling yet heavy with melancholy" slightly blurs pressure, but closure image ("bamboo tea whisk tucked away") remains crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "philosopher laborer" trope via net-mending specificity and "demure audacity" synthesis. Emotional truth in linking tea ritual to fishermen’s toil avoids genericity; risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
