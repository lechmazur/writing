<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract ("motivation burned quietly") without contradictory impulses in action; the shadow's personal origin revelation lacks struggle in pivotal confrontation beat, reducing earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with visible cost ("luminous regret lingered"), but the shadow's origin discovery via footage feels convenient rather than earned escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>River stone constrains choices (grounding tool during transformation) and charges final image as guardian anchor; "blooming shelves" evolve causally with shadow's growth, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving hope's shape) tightens meaningfully as shadow erodes dream-vaults, but pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation—the solution emerges from footage review rather than Elara's active adaptation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through river stone's transformation (enduring hope vs. dissolving dreams), but "shape of hope" remains slightly abstract; final image reweights regret without moralizing, though secondary stakes dilute focus.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer" noticing "luminous regret" in petals) modulates rhythm under pressure; consistent focalization avoids head-hopping despite reflective footage sequences.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Softly deliberate" repeats four times as scaffold; lyrical density occasionally muddles action ("coaxing secrets from fading light" during high-stakes shadow confrontation).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-archives and botanical metaphors avoids trope repetition, but "unbound shadow" concept relies on familiar regret symbolism without sufficiently non-obvious emotional calculus in resolution.</comment>
