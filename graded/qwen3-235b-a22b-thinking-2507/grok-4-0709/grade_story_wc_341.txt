<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in scientific mind pursuing emotional cloud taxonomy, but "quietly explosive grief" triggers label-speak penalty during climax where embodied cost must anchor change; tears alone insufficient for full Q1 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully when Mira's cloud portrait forms—cost visible in Elias' tears and whispered name—but Accumulative/Textural lens slightly frayed by "ignited" metaphor implying external intervention rather than pure emotional accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sky gondola and brass telescope function as micro-setting: telescope's magnification enables the cloud portrait revelation, constraining Elias' observation method and charging the final image where it "gleamed under the stars" as proof of remembrance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stake "empty spaces remember" escalates through Elias' cloud-categorizing ritual tightening his focus toward the void, but agency remains observational rather than active choice; cost is emotional vulnerability in believing, legible via physical reaction to the portrait.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically from cloud motifs until final paragraph's "wholeness wasn't lost; merely rewound" triggers Thematic Echo penalty—overt repricing undermines earned ambiguity, though the dissolving portrait image itself offers resonant closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in cloud descriptions ("frayed like unspoken regrets") reflects Elias' grief, but "quietly explosive" disrupts voice during climax; rhythm modulates effectively from meditative to breathless during the portrait's appearance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density in cloud imagery avoids overwriting, yet "dusty starlight" repetition (3x) and "spooled wholeness" near-synonym churn in final beats dull closure's propulsion; no fatal artifacts but minor scaffold prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorology and grief via emotional cloud taxonomy, but "empty spaces remember" concept lacks transformation from familiar tropes; risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off though final thematic statement feels safe.</comment>
