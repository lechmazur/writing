<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lacks embodied internal contradiction; librarian's motivation is clear but his "serene calm" during identity fusion avoids visible struggle. No micro-choices under pressure—ritual feels predetermined rather than earned through conflict. Strengths include coherent traits and clear goal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: fused identity migrating toward dweller crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost ("drowned ruin" void). But escalation lacks meaningful deepening—the moon-phase fluctuation isn't leveraged to narrow options or raise cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tidal atrium’s sensory details (bioluminescent plankton, bronze gears) anchor atmosphere vividly. Fisherman’s creel functions as micro-setting but doesn’t fully charge the final image; shelving the tome echoes its purpose without constraining the closure beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving wonder) is clear early, but pressure remains static—the identities’ "chaotic protest" resolves too easily via monologue without protagonist-driven deepening. Cost is conceptual ("spark lost") but not viscerally dramatized on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "winter sunlight on frost-kissed waves" contrasting with "storm-tossed sailor" rage. Final line "Wonder endures" avoids moralizing, but monk/sailor fusion feels schematic rather than embracing complexity with counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("geared heart," "winter sun's quiet warmth") with rhythmic control. Minor flaw: emotional intensity flattens during ritual ("serene hum" mismatches identities' "chaotic protest"), missing modulation under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "scattered across wet stone floor" varies syntax masterfully. One hairline slip: "swirling vortex of memories" slightly abstract in high-pressure beat, but no loops or artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of steampunk librarian + philosophical ritual transforms "preserving wonder" trope through tidal mechanics. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off, but premise lacks radical novelty—emotional truth anchors it without unexpected turns.</comment>
