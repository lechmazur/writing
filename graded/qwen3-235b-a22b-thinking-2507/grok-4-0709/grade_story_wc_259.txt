<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority relies on diagnostic labels ("anguished joy") without concrete embodiment; final realization feels unearned as no prior struggle with cost is shown. No micro-choices beyond prescribed dance mechanics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Earned Stasis under Accumulative lens with felt cost ("innocence could never return"), but "avoid patterns" method emerges too late to drive escalation organically. Strong cost proof in collapse scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid archive descriptions lack tactical constraints; only twilight timing for pagoda functions as environmental pressure. No recurring object or body constrains choices despite lyrical density.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</question><grade>Stakes escalate through atom purification count under Accumulative lens, but protagonist agency feels ritualistic rather than choice-driven. Cost is clear yet passive ("pang struck her soul").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Final image ("smiled through tears... beautiful ache") offers resonant non-literal answer to "end of innocence" without moralizing. Theme emerges through purified atoms' shifting colors and visions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose dazzles but "anguished joy" repeats as label rather than embodied state; stress distorts syntax insufficiently during high-pressure dance. Voice lacks character-specific perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Overwriting in climax ("iridescent clouds... purifying flames") muddles causality; "anguished joy" repetition creates paraphrase loop. Final line ("beautiful ache") rescues closure beat from density penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Atoms of nostalgia" concept fresh but "end of innocence" trope handled generically; bronze pagoda feels derivative of prismatic truth tropes without specific transformation.</comment>
