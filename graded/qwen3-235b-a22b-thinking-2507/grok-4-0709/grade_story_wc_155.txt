<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority stays abstract ("pensive mirth" repeated without embodied contradiction); micro-choices lack meaningful stakes escalation despite clear motivation; closure endurance lacks felt cost beyond waking.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (joy remains veiled), but cost legibility falters—no exact sentence shows price paid for rediscovery; fog thinning implies loss without tangible consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orchard ruins actively constrain choices (kneeling, fog-limited vision); fresco fragment as micro-setting charges final image; sensory details filtered through artist’s POV ("diffused light," "damp earth") enhance specificity without clutter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming joy) faces no concrete pressure—knowledge network resolves instantly with no resistance; escalation lacks protagonist-driven trade-offs; "faint spark" never truly conflicts with melancholy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through light/film motifs, but final image ("ready to paint") oversimplifies loss; avoids moralizing yet lacks complexity—eroded joys are "merely veiled," ignoring irreversible costs of time.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("paint with light" lexicon) shines; rhythmic control varies under pressure ("branches clawing... like fingers grasping"); no POV slippage despite dream logic, though "pensive mirth" repetition dulls nuance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; high density ("flickering images of bountiful harvests" compresses time); "pensive mirth" phrase loop in climax (-0.1) slightly dilutes propulsion but closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-logic and artistic process; risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "knowledge network" feels derivative of common fantasy tropes.</comment>
