<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (thief vs destiny-seeker) surfaces late; "life beyond thievery" epiphany lacks prior struggle with artistic yearning, making the earned endurance feel abrupt despite strong embodied doubt during the portrait reinterpretation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Orientation debt: "Emerald Station" anchor delayed past 120 words without functional disorientation payoff; closure (Charged Poise) lands with felt cost but lens ambiguity in escalation weakens the "because/therefore" linkage for the moonbeam jar's decisive role.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Capped due to Q2 orientation penalty; emerald tiles and moonlight create vivid texture but fail as active constraints—Elara’s choices (e.g., floral distraction) aren’t shaped by station-specific pressures, missing the 9+ gate’s requirement for environment to charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Accumulative lens via moonbeam reinterpretation, but the protagonist’s agency falters—the magical revelation drives the climax, not her choices, diluting the visible cost of abandoning thievery despite resonant final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the portrait’s shifting meaning; final image reweights "thievery" into "creation" without moralizing, though "luminous disbelief" repetition risks thematic echo, narrowly avoiding the −0.6 penalty for final-paragraph abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("golden-hour portrait thief," "soul fragments") and rhythmic control shine under pressure; no head-hopping, with psychic distance shifts (e.g., "her mind a vault") deepening interiority without filter-verb clutter during the theft sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in opening ("fleeting golden sunset" → "moonlight began to claim the sky" density) and near-synonym loops ("luminous disbelief" x3) reduce propulsion; final image’s "forever altered" edges toward abstraction but avoids closure-dulling artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of floral ciphers and light metaphysics elevates the thief trope; emotional specificity in her doubt ("just another illusion?") avoids genericity, though the destiny-revelation climax borrows from familiar transformative-moment templates without sufficient risk distinction.</comment>
