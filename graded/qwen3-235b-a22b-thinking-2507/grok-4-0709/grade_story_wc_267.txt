<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: Elias’s mute service versus yearning voice, embodied in the bolt discovery micro-choice. Mira’s off-page presence lacks pressure, slightly weakening relationship crucible despite strong embodied guilt and nerve-regeneration specifics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "he would return the bolt... breaking his own quiet" crystallizes stance with felt cost (enduring silence to confront it). Accumulative lens holds—dust, cold, and memory patterns reweight safety’s cost without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cobalt fortress actively constrains: snow blankets sound enabling the "unpardonable silence" stake; the dusty staircase’s bolt discovery directly charges the climax. Micro-setting (piano bench bolt) evolves from luggage detail to soul-regeneration symbol, irreplaceably shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safety’s cost) tightens via Elias’s agency: curiosity about discoloration triggers memory flood, forcing stance crystallization. Cost is visceral—choosing fortress silence as active confrontation, not fear—with the bolt’s warmth crystallizing the trade-off in the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through bolt symbolism: "true safety demanded the risk of sound" avoids moralizing, reweighting "unpardonable silence" via Elias’s earned choice. Final image ("hope no longer entirely frostbitten") offers resonant, non-literal answer without stated moral, embracing moral complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "cobalt walls gleamed like frozen sapphires" filters setting through Elias’s frozen psyche. Minor register drift—"seraphically mundane" feels authorial rather than character-particular—but rhythmic control under pressure (shortened sentences during bolt discovery) excels.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero momentum-drag loops; high density ("snow sifted through cracks like whispered secrets"). Slight artifact: "seraphically mundane" repeats as near-synonym (para 5, 10), risking thematic echo but not muddying closure. Final line’s cadence shift ("spark against the cold") propels closure flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms trauma tropes through specific synthesis: mute choirboy bellhop + piano bolt as redemption mechanism feels inevitable. "Frostbitten hope" avoids sentimentality by grounding universality in cobalt fortress’s tangible cold, with bold risk-taking in quiet closure that heightens stakes.</comment>
