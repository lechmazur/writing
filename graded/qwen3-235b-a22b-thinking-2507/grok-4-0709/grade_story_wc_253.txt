<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (reporting neighbors vs. aiding grief) act simultaneously in scene; final endurance choice earned by "moral weight" cost. Mira's thin characterization slightly undermines relationship crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes cost through "moral weight of ambiguity" and "remade hush enveloping everything" under Accumulative lens. Turbines' final hum reconfigures the void with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Wind turbines actively constrain choices (Mira's wary glance, drone as emotional suppressor); dried bouquet charges closure when Mira feels "cultivated lightness." Micro-setting (whittling knife) directly shapes the ritual's mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation via Elias' agency: narration ritual deepens Mira's engagement, then his solitary endurance forecloses escape. Cost is visceral in "moral weight" and "endless emotional void" under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "whispers against turbines' whoosh" reweights grief as bearable lightness. Final image ("chasing lightness in void") resonates without moralizing, making conceptual cost undeniable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: notices "brittle" bouquet, "mandated smile," turbine shadows. Rhythm modulates from theatrical narration to sparse closure. Psychic distance shifts intentionally during performance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; sentences do triple duty (e.g., "knife etching finer details" shows action/tool/emotion). Final line’s cadence ("chasing lightness...") crystallizes theme without muddle. Minor "remade hush" repetition avoided penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "happiness mandate" made specific through whittling-as-ritual. Emotional truth in "morally ambiguous balm" avoids dystopian clichés. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
