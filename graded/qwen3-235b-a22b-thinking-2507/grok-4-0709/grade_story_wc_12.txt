<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("resolve burned quietly") and embodied micro-choices (abrupt silence pause) powerfully reveal character under pressure, though "motivation burned quietly" edges toward abstraction without sufficient physicality in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Earned Stasis with visible cost ("Elias exhaled") under Accumulative/Textural lens, but time pressure ("unseen hour") lacks tracking, weakening escalation’s causal logic despite strong density buildup to the indigo pulse climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dimensional anchor actively constrains choices (cracks revealing realms forcing tactical shifts), while the palette’s indigo directly charges the final image sealing fissures—micro-setting integration exceeds typical vivid description to shape outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through deepening rhetorical density ("Why do we assume, assume, assume?") with tangible cost (tendrils grazing robe), but the live clock ("unseen hour") remains vague, missing a chance to tighten tactics under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through action ("silence decorated, clarity calls"), avoiding moralizing; final line’s "muffled dawn" reweights "hidden assumptions" into resonant, non-literal closure without abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("arranging pauses like ornaments") and rhythmic control mirror pedal loops under pressure, though elevated diction ("insidious grip") briefly clashes with priestly POV in high-stakes moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Two paraphrase loops ("unraveled stillness manifested... Time was slipping" / "plumbed deeper... probing like a diver") dull momentum in escalation beats, preventing 8.8+ despite otherwise clean propulsion and strategic figurative restraint.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of audio ritual with theological combat feels inevitable ("loop pedal priest" transforming trope), though dimensional horror framework lacks sufficient specificity to push beyond strong execution into 9.0 territory.</comment>
