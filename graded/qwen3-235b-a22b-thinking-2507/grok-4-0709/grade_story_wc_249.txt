<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "cage disguised as salvation" and drumming defiance, but micro-choices lack escalation; "rebellious" trait remains label-only without visible tradeoffs during drumming.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with conceptual cost in ambiguous pulse, but lens ambiguity early ("hush of universe" timeframe feels decorative) nearly triggers -0.4 penalty; orientation clear by word 5.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Auric lagoon constrains choice (drumming surface) and charges final image; sound wave garden’s vibrating crystals actively shape drumming tactics with sensory specificity ("cool resonance vibrate through her bones").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming Lir) signaled early, but drumming escalation lacks felt cost—scientists’ warnings ignored without consequence, missing the "visible price" requirement for high-band scores under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through drumming’s physicality, but final paragraph’s "sorrow transforming into hopeful lament" violates organic emergence with thematic echo, costing 0.7 per Q5 penalty rules.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("echoes bloomed like ethereal flowers") sustains under pressure; rhythmic control in drumming sequence taught early and paid off, though "auroral sorrow" repetition slightly dilutes voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Template cadence in drumming sequence ("she drummed... she drummed...") triggers -0.5; "auroral sorrow" as therapy-speak label in peak beats (-0.6); artifacts in final third disallow 9+ globally per Q7 rules.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory entanglement as sonic landscape feels inevitable, but "rebellious" trope lacks transformation—Elara’s defiance follows predictable guinea-pig-rebellion pattern without unique moral calculus.</comment>
