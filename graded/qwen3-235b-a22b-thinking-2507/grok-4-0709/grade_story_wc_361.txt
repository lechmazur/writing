<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s embodied jitteriness and micro-choice to gift the pendant reveal her value hierarchy; Kael’s transformation through the pendant shows authentic internal contradiction. Over-tidy resolution slightly dilutes the cost of Thorne’s fading legacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as Kael’s "routine path now laced with possibility" crystallizes the cost of Elara’s mythologization. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, but the conceptual cost of fading legacy lacks visceral punch on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The pendant functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (Kael’s hesitation, extended encounter) and charges the final image ("clutched the pendant, transformed"). Aurora’s shifting light actively mirrors emotional evolution without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving wonder amid fading legacy) tighten through the pendant’s use, narrowing Elara’s options to a single act of transmission. Cost (her mythologization) is felt but slightly abstract; Kael’s transformation lacks tangible tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the pendant’s vibration syncing with Kael’s breath, reweighting "routine toil" into possibility without moralizing. Final image of farmers "coaxing wonder" offers resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Elara’s aurora-filtered observations ("whisper from eras slipping away"); rhythmic control swells with the pendant’s hum. No head-hopping; stress compresses diction without breaking voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor synonym churn ("fading from memory to myth" repetition) and elevated diction ("jittery relic courier") slightly disrupt momentum. High density compensates, but "fading auroras" description risks static repetition in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of courier trope via the pendant’s vibration mechanics and aurora’s emotional resonance. Avoids safety middle by making wonder’s transmission fragile yet transformative, though mentor fade lacks risk distinction.</comment>
