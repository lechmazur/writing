<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown via "tactfully hopeful" approach versus raw grief, but divorce backstory lacks specific embodied conflict; the button parallel to her ex's note feels earned yet slightly under-developed in active struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly—"broken heart stir with possibility" crystallizes reconfigured stakes with felt cost, though dust-trail discovery edges toward coincidence under Accumulative lens; final cost legible in dust-removal action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dust patterns function as micro-setting that actively constrains choice (guiding folder selection) and charges closure (brushing away to start fresh); file room’s physicality—brittle ledgers, "puffing" dust—directly shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mending soul via history) tightens meaningfully through button discovery, but emotional escalation lacks visceral friction; cost of vulnerability remains slightly abstract despite resonant final stir.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from button’s legacy without moralizing; final image ("heal, one unfurled story at a time") reweights "magnify small kindnesses" through action, avoiding abstraction while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tactfully hopeful," "examined unknown") modulates under pressure, but minor filter verbs ("she sensed") and "wryly called" divorce detail slightly dilute immediacy in high-stakes beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong propulsion with sparse loops, though "puffing into the air like a sigh from the past" edges toward cliché in closure beat; strategic telling compresses backstory efficiently without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms archival discovery trope via specific historical texture (sharecropping dispute, Quaker foster home); dust-pattern device feels fresh, though "healing through history" premise risks familiarity without such concrete grounding.</comment>
