<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "cautiously hopeful" vs "wary of chaos," embodied via trembling hands and calibrated emitter. Final choice earned through prior causality but lacks deeper flaw compounding; micro-choices stay surface-level under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "scars of division running deep" makes cost undeniable while "vigilant" stance crystallizes under Causal lens. Pressure tightens via protest escalation → interference → community calm with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Radio station's "outdated equipment" and "subsonic emitter" constrain choices (cobbled device, sticky dials), charging the final image where "hum of subsonic echoes" grounds victory. Micro-setting specificity elevates beyond atmospheric window dressing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally: tricksters' "vector" targets tonight's protest → Elara's interference directly narrows options to disrupt violence. Cost ("scars of division") is legible in the final beat, though secondary emotional toll remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "cosmic chess" metaphor reweighted by final vigilance: no moralizing, only resonant image of "scars" and "shifted constellations" answering the central question with earned ambiguity about enduring cosmic games.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in "ethereal grit" details ("scent of stale coffee and ozone") and stress-modulated syntax ("shouts softened, as if an invisible fog lifted"). Zero head-hopping; voice stays anchored in academic-adjacent lexicon even under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "ethereal beings of light and shadow, scrambling in their distant realm" slightly dulls climax rhythm. Otherwise exceptional density: "subsonic interference neutralizing the tricksters' influence" compresses cause/effect without loss.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Ethereal grit" synthesizes cosmic horror with academic realism through specific mechanics (subsonic frequencies, vinyl records). Risk-taking heightens stakes but "cosmic chess" metaphor edges toward familiar tropes without full transformation.</comment>
