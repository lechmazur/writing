<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in skeptic-to-need shift; embodied loss ("hollow hum") avoids label-speak; final choice earned through somatic micro-choices under pressure. Only minor flaw: "willowglass hope" slightly over-articulated for mid-crisis thought.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the light painting crystallizes options with conceptual cost ("tangible constellation of reclaimed past"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density escalation; cost legible in "hollow hum" → immersive reliving trade-off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the muscovite geode sliver constrains the climax choice and charges the final image. Studio clutter evolves from "alien" to active resource; sensory hierarchy (somatic over visual) mirrors memory loss/recovery stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: pill ingestion → somatic focus → geode reach. Pressure coheres via Accumulative lens; cost ("hollow hum" → immersive flood) is unmistakable. Minor deduction: static shock as inciting incident slightly convenient but functional.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through light painting as "tangible constellation"—resonant answer to memory loss without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; "skeptic had not just believed" integrates with action. Cost reweights "affectionate skeptic" into embodied wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: artist’s tactile bias ("cool flatness," "dull inner fire") shapes all description. Rhythmic control under pressure ("fractally precise clarity") avoids head-hopping. Slight register drift in "willowglass hope" but voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion through concrete verbs ("shook," "swept," "ignited"). "Hollow hum" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor figurative muddle in "buzzing through his nerves like a bad memory" (mixed metaphor) costs 0.1 but avoids closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis: somatic memory recovery via light painting transforms familiar amnesia trope. "Willowglass hope" and geode-as-key feel inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking (pill as catalyst) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
