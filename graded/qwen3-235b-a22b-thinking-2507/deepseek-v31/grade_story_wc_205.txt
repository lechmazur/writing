<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: revolutionary hunger for crowds vs solitary victory's sorrow. Embodied flaw in "burnished sorrow" as both anchor and weight. Micro-choice of covering mirrors reveals hierarchy of values (removing self from equation). No secondary character needed per scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: "profound burnished sorrow settled... heavier than before" crystallizes solitary triumph's hollowness. Accumulative lens holds—storm intensifies sensory pressure, revelation tightens knowledge. Cost proof test passed via final image of shard as "perfect, lonely star".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid constrains choice (mirror-covering ritual) and charges closure (shard as "lonely star" against velvet). Time-as-threads visualization evolves from backdrop to storm-reactive tapestry. Micro-setting (crystal shard) dictates climax—bending light reconfigures civilization's meaning. Meets 9+ gate via object constraining choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (art vs war civilization) escalates via storm's pressure, tightening knowledge through shard's light-refraction revelation. Agency drives escalation—Kaelen's poetic mind "weaves words around frequencies". Cost is legible: victory's "solitary, whisper into static-filled void" forecloses communal revolution. Single tightening sufficient per scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through shard's refracted light as "capturing ephemeral magnificence", rejecting conquest. Final image reweights premise without moralizing—lonely shard embodies civilization's true legacy. Avoids thematic echo; sorrow isn't balanced but earned. Resonant non-literal answer: art's purpose is daily beauty, paid for with isolation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "time was not a river but a visible, frayed knot". Rhythmic control under pressure: storm's "muffled silence" shifts to frantic "tapestry of time". Purposeful compression ("research was a liturgy of burnished sorrow") taught early, paid in closure. Zero head-hopping; voice modulates from poetic to contemplative.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffolding; "prismatic fire" and "frantic tapestry" advance atmosphere without clutter. Minor synonym drift: "burnished sorrow" appears twice but earns resonance via closure. Final line’s "perfect, lonely star" achieves high-density propulsion. No figurative muddle in peak beats—storm revelation uses concrete optics ("patterns of capturing luminance").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms archaeological trope via light-refraction proof method. Emotional specificity in "sole citizen of reimagined world" avoids generic melancholy. Risk-taking: Accumulative structure replaces confrontation with sensory revelation. Fresh inflection: victory’s cost is the proof itself, not external defeat. Derivative premise guardrail avoided through lived detail.</comment>
