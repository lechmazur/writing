<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong in "thin shield against cold damp" and buoyant water/hope duality, but "rebellion wasn’t about explosions" risks thematic abstraction. Final choice (taking archive) earned through grandfather’s key and micro-choice to wade slowly, though some emotional progression slightly tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes with undeniable cost: "weight... immense" and "work would be slow" foreclose easy victory. Accumulative lens holds—puddle map deepens into lagoon archive with causal density. Orientation clear by 40 words; rain/stars anchor time/location instantly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Auric lagoon constrains choice (wading alters tactics) and charges final image ("secret held in world’s palm"). Sensory hierarchy perfect: oily puddles mirror neon city early, gold water embodies hope late. Micro-setting (key) functions as tool with tactile payoff in compartment reveal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single stake (truth vs. amnesia) deepens through atmospheric pressure—puddle reflection tightens options from waiting to action. Agency in "ambled direction" shows resourcefulness under surveillance. Cost legible in "immense weight" and "slow, deliberate work," reweighting rebellion as endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "coded freedom" and "whisper in static," avoiding moralizing. Final image ("seed," "long-lost memory returning home") reweights "tyranny of indifference" without stating morals. No thematic echo—insights earned via lagoon/water symbolism charging closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "shattered portrait of neon-drenched city" filters through rebel’s vigilance. Rhythm modulates from slow dread ("quiet, mocking hiss") to resolve ("he would make them see"). Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" phrasing risks abstraction but stays grounded.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Adjacent paraphrase loop: "it was about memory. It was about making people care" triggers -0.2. Otherwise stellar density—"auric water warm and strangely buoyant, as if buoying his hope"—avoids overwriting. Final line resonant with "quiet insistence" echoing opening "hiss."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms dystopian tropes through specific details: puddle-reflection map, auric lagoon’s buoyancy. Emotional truth in "memory as rebellion" avoids generic resistance. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over action) heightens stakes coherently; transformation test passes—names/places integral to premise.</comment>
