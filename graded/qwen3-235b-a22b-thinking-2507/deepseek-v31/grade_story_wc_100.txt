<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through specific actions (fitting flawed lens imperfectly), but grandfather's dissolution lacks contradictory impulses; micro-choices under pressure excel though final change edges toward tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: light beam reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost ("dissolve into the light itself"); orientation anchors by 42 words; lens (Accumulative/Textural) held rigorously through pressure buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Underwater library constrains every choice (swimming through archway, dome repair); recurring lens charges final image; sensory details ("kelp slow-dancing," "ink bleeding into ghosts") reflect urgency without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (answering distress signal) tightens meaningfully via protagonist agency; cost is undeniable in grandfather's dissolution, though escalation could heighten urgency earlier under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "permanent address" evolves from graveyards to lightbeam's welcome; final image ("chased stillness... caught") reweights premise without moralizing; avoids all thematic echo traps.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("silence a physical pressure") distinct under pressure, but minor filter verbs ("he felt compelled") dilute immediacy; rhythmic control impeccable despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion ("books floated... pages moving like gentle breath"), but slight paraphrase loop in "drowned and eternal, silent yet screaming" deducts; zero artifacts in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse trope via "librarian of dead" specificity; risk-taking (underwater library) heightens stakes coherently; emotional truth anchors "chased stillness" beyond surface novelty.</comment>
