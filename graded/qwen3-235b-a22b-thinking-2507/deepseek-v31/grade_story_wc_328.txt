<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation shift from academic detachment to empathetic participation is concrete and embodied, culminating in the arrowhead throw as a micro-choice revealing her hierarchy of values. Internal conflict manifests through simultaneous awe and academic impulse but lacks fully simultaneous contradictory impulses during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable cost: the Changed's bitterness dissolving into laughter after the garden's note reconfigures their reality. Orientation is rock-solid by line 1, though lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural dominant) slightly weakens escalation coherence before the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The underground garden's "gravitationally playful" physics actively constrains action (water spiraling upward, arrowhead orbiting) and charges the final image. Micro-setting of the arrowhead evolving from weapon to node meets 9+ gate, though occupational detail about cryptid research remains superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Aris's mission vs. empathetic awakening) tightens through the confessions' deepening revelations, culminating in her arrowhead throw. Cost is legible in the Changed's transformed anguish, but escalation lacks sufficient protagonist agency before the climax beat under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: arrowhead (division) vs. garden (connection), with the final note offering a non-literal answer ("add your own voice") that reweights the bitterness. Avoids moralizing while embracing complexity—no thematic echo, just earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frostbitten hope," "alien chlorophyll") modulates perfectly with emotional intensity. Minor register drift in "gravitationally playful energy" slightly jars, but rhythmic control during the climax ("a single, perfect note...") demonstrates mastery under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with high information density, though slight overwriting in "magnetically playful energy" creates a minor coherence hiccup. Zero loops or scaffold; final image prose achieves crystalline clarity without sacrificing lyricism.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms abduction tropes through physics-poetry synthesis ("gravity as mood"), with "gravitationally playful" feeling freshly inevitable. Emotional specificity avoids genericity—Aris's shift from dissection to participation embodies bold risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
