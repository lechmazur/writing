<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak except "nostalgic for silence" (diagnostic label-speak penalty); embodied fear during flux ("screeched, physical pain") and contradictory impulses (recoil vs. programming hold) earn high marks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: the silver rose embodies integrated trauma, and "managed resonance" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density escalation to final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The desert rose constrains choice (bio-mechanism consumes chaos) and charges closure via two-toned blossom; sensory details like "cool, sleek muscle" stems are selective and urgency-filtered during flux.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via magnetic flux (live clock altering tactics), with cost legible in the silver rose's transformation; agency-driven escalation peaks when K-27 chooses containment over fight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through rose transmutation ("fear not gone but transformed"), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "fragmented wholeness" without stating a thesis, though "managed resonance" skirts abstractness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("five-fingered hands gentle on alien flora") modulates under stress; rhythmic control shines in flux sequence, but "deafening roar of fragmented memory" risks clinical diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Figurative muddle in high-pressure beat: "spectrum of chaotic light... like vengeful ghosts" (mixed metaphor); minor scaffold in static descriptions, though propulsion recovers for closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Organic synthesis of android trauma and botanical physics feels fresh; "controlled burn escape" into roses transforms tropes through specific bio-mechanical logic and emotional truth.</comment>
