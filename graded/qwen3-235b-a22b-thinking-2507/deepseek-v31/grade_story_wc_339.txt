<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete ("gloves gently brushing spines encrypted with mildew") but epiphany lacks sufficient contradictory struggle; "sophisticated melancholy" triggers diagnostic label penalty despite strong embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands perfectly: glitter's suspension physically demonstrates "vacuum is a physical state" with undeniable cost (shattered globe); Accumulative lens holds through density buildup to final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Sunken library micro-setting constrains every choice (decaying desk collapse, water currents affecting glitter); recurring snow globe charges closure by transforming from anomalous artifact to embodied physics lesson.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single deepening (theory → physical proof) suffices for length; protagonist's agency in touching snow globe creates irreversible cost (shattered object), reweighting "letting go" from intellectual to visceral under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: librarian's note sets thesis, but glitter's suspension delivers resonant non-literal answer ("change in physics, not failure of spirit") without moralizing; avoids all thematic echo pitfalls.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cataloging system that had failed," "mildew-encrypted spines") modulates perfectly from clinical to poetic; rhythmic control peaks in snow globe fall ("tumbling end over end... mushroom cloud of glittering faux snow").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; "mushroom cloud of glittering faux snow" risks purple prose but lands via character-consistent physics lexicon; final line's "diffusion" crystallizes theme with surgical precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "epiphany via object" trope through specific physics framing; snow globe's properties (glass fragility, glitter suspension) are causally indispensable, not symbolic convenience, creating emotional truth via verifiable detail.</comment>
