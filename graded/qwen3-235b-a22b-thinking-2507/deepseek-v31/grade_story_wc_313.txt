<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction crystallizes in photo discovery: warden duty vs. citizen identity. Embodied cost in the liqueur sip, no diagnostic labels. Micro-choice to preserve shows hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: shrine arrangement forces bulldozer crews to confront stories, with cost in Elias’s vulnerability ("holding its breath"). Accumulative lens holds through photo accumulation; "sharp sip" legibly charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Reservoir basin’s cracked mud "scar" and skeletal rooftops constrain photo placement and charge the final shrine. Ridge setting pressures movement but "midnight ridgeway" lacks specific tactical constraint beyond path navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve meaning vs. erase pain) tightens through photo trail discoveries. Agency-driven escalation culminates in the uncorking choice, with visible cost in the liqueur’s embodied taste and exposed vulnerability to bulldozer crews.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: wind chime painting photo reframes "vigilant heart" as belonging, not duty. Final image reweights memory as shared burden ("holding its breath"), avoiding moralizing while answering how stories survive erasure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "cracked mud flats stretching like a vast, ugly scar" and elderberry/thyme liqueur. Rhythmic control in climax ("he uncorked... took a small, sharp sip") avoids ventriloquism; slight register drift in "precisely humane."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("metallic whisper consumed by the dusk"). "Skeletal outlines... ghostly architecture" borders cliché in peak beat, but "sharp sip" and bottle placement maintain clarity and propulsion through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "dying town" trope via liqueur’s specific flavor and wind chime painting photo. Emotional truth in "forgotten he was also its citizen" synthesizes duty/belonging; risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
