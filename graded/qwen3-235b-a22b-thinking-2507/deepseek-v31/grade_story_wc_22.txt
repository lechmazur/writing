<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in embodied action (crumbling seeds, listening to birds) reveals character; micro-choices under pressure show hierarchy of values. Lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal moments—resolve feels predetermined without visible internal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("vast horror narrowed into a single shoot") under Accumulative lens. Pressure coheres through sensory density; cost legible in the seed-splitting sounds. Minor causality gap: no friction in planting decision weakens escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Jetty and seed pods constrain choices (stopping at end to plant, using pods as fertilizer) and charge the final image. Sensory details ("cerulean," "rustling click") evolve with emotional urgency, avoiding white-room syndrome through tactile integration with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via sensory escalation (gulls to shore lark signaling readiness), narrowing options toward planting. Cost is conceptual ("poison spoken out of ground") but lacks visible trade-off; agency feels untested as pressure never threatens his method.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reclamation (seeds splitting, algae on reef), not abstraction. Final image reweights "vast horror" into "tender shoot" as resonant answer to central question. Avoids moralizing while embedding cost in the earth’s response.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("phonetic remnants of cavalry charge," bird-language translation) modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control shifts from measured twilight walks to urgent seed-crumbling. No head-hopping; voice remains anchored in Elros’s embodied cognition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "rustling click" delivers propulsion in closure beat. Minor density issue: "profound narrow vastness" slightly overwrites the jetty’s tension. Final line’s "earth answering" achieves crystalline clarity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ecological grief and linguistic reclamation avoids war-tale tropes. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes ("seeding a graveyard with words from its own ghosts"), but premise isn’t radically transformed beyond execution.</comment>
