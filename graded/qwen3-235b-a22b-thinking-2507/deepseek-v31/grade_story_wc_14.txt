<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>No secondary character, but single-POV interiority excels: "gasped" at volcanic texture shows embodied contradiction (scholarly precision vs. visceral reaction). Lacks blind spots/flaws complicating choices; her flawless focus weakens earned closure despite micro-choices like breath-matching the hum.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density escalates via refracted visions (volcanic cone → lovers → winter devastation) until dawn's hum steadies. Closure is Earned Stasis—"body stiff but spirit incandescent" shows cost as she closes the notepad. Only flaw: escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening; dawn's arrival feels environmental, not tactical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fluorescent lamp functions as micro-setting that charges closure ("portable whole" of captured epochs), but bonsai labyrinth remains ornamental backdrop. Sensory details ("damp soil and tender bark") are POV-filtered through stationer's texture obsession, though environment doesn't constrain choices beyond enabling the ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving time textures before dawn) tightens via the hum's natural calming, but Aris lacks agency in escalation—pressure is environmental, not choice-driven. Cost ("body stiff") is visible, yet her passive endurance feels inevitable rather than earned through conflicting tactics under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme (invented histories as emotional truth) emerges through particulars: scribbling "dense, looping script" as "map of moments." Final line ("textures... were real") reweights premise without moralizing. Lacks meaningful ambiguity—histories' validity is unchallenged, slightly reducing thematic complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: stationer notices "flecks of precious foil" and "granular shift of epochs." Rhythm modulates under pressure ("scribbled furiously" during visions) with no syntactic monotony. Lyric compression ("a collection of sleeping stone") taught early pays off in closure's restrained fulfillment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cascading images that filled the pavilion" avoids overwriting by linking to embodied action ("gasp"). Final line's reprise ("textures... were safe") recharges opening motifs with crystalline clarity. Minor deduction for "breathtaking, tiny majesty" bordering on purple prose, but not in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: time textures via fluorescent hum (not time travel) and bonsai as constrained epochs. Emotional specificity in "invented histories" avoids abstraction. Transformation test passed—swap "gilded-leaf stationer" for generic "archivist," and foil-dusted hands' texture obsession vanishes, breaking premise coherence.</comment>
