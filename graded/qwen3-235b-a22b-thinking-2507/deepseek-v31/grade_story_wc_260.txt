<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses ("stupidity of trust" vs. "believing in people was never stupid") manifest physically during terrarium work; no therapy-speak as he replays lies while clearing soil. Final endurance earned by handling the tail tip.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: chameleon's color shift crystallizes acceptance with legible cost ("fragile convictions reforming"). Orientation clear by word 12; Accumulative lens held via sensory density tightening to "tiny monument amid new ferns".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Terrarium gravel and shed tail constrain choices—Elias plants the tail tip, directly charging the final image. Mist affects starlight penetration during climax; handler's tactile soil attention shapes perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trust vs. self-preservation) tightens through physical acts: clearing damaged foliage becomes peeling trust layers. Cost legible in "fragile convictions reforming" as he places the tail tip—a trade-off honoring loss to rebuild.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from chameleon's biology ("shedding layers") reweighted in closure: tail tip in soil and color shift offer non-literal answer to betrayal without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo via embodied action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Handler's perceptual signature: "papery fragility" of tail tip, soil texture focus. Under stress, syntax shortens ("He began to work"); "quietly vivid" descriptor appears organically in chameleon description, not forced theme.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop: "reconstruct/reconstruction" adjacent sentences about terrarium. No figurative muddle; "desiccated piece" avoids stock metaphors. Tail tip's "papery fragility" delivers textural specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms betrayal trope through biological mechanism: chameleon's adaptive coloring becomes epiphany catalyst. Specific handler detail (keeping shed tail weeks later) avoids middle-ground hedging.</comment>
