<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Limited interior contradiction; motivation is pure but lacks deeper conflict beyond the immediate task. "Muted vigor" shows embodied action, yet emotional complexity stays surface-level during high-stakes tuning. Strength lies in micro-choices (adjusting stones by "hair's breadths") revealing her hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through sensory decay (sour note → frosted ice → weeping fragment) to a Charged Poise closure. Cost is legible in the valley's "color of wonder" blushing back, but escalation lacks one visceral intensification beat before the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The kinetic sculpture functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (e.g., "shifting hanging stones by hair's breadths") and charging the final image with prismatic light. Environment directly shapes tactics—high-altitude sun reactivates the ice—meeting 9+ gate with exceptional specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving wonder) are viscerally felt through the ice's decay, but the cost remains conceptual ("inevitable decay") rather than embodied in Elara's sacrifice. Escalation is driven by her agency under Accumulative lens, yet one deeper intensification beat would elevate the pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—cleaning the ice, adjusting the sculpture—not abstraction. The final image ("color of wonder... blushed across the valley") reweights "silence and song" without moralizing, offering a resonant answer to the central question of balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: notices via touch ("discord through soles of boots") and kinetic intuition. Rhythmic control under pressure shines in sparse crisis sentences ("For a long moment, nothing happened"). Slight register drift in "muted vigor" slightly disrupts voice cohesion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion via tactile verbs ("biting cold," "trembled," "tapped"). Final line ("Her work was done") crystallizes Earned Stasis. Minor overwriting in "spun moonlight" cloth—elevated diction slightly clashes with POV's pragmatic focus during crisis.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "symphonies of truth" from cliché into concrete mechanics (kinetic sculpture filtering harmony). Fresh synthesis: silence as active listening, muteness as heightened perception. Avoids derivative fantasy through specific physics of sound resonance.</comment>
