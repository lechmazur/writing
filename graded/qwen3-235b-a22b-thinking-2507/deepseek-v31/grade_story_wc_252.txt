<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in suppressed identity; embodied longing from scrimshaw avoids labels. Contradictory impulses (duty vs yearning) layer during rowing sequence. Final renunciation earned through mental severing, though pre-scrimshaw internal conflict lacks depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: Silas dropping the scrimshaw while turning from Aethelburgh’s lights. Accumulative lens holds through sensory deepening; the sublittoral transition and rowing sequence tighten stakes without causal breaks. Orientation clear by paragraph one.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Scrimshaw and sublittoral fringe constrain choices—dredge finds chest, pebble beach landing dictates action. Sensory details (salt/cold stone/deep time) mirror internal shift. Whale’s call as bodily vibration avoids tourist cataloging, charging the final image with specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freedom vs pacified conformity) signaled early via "combative tenderness." Escalation through mental severing during rowing forecloses safety with visible cost (strained tether). Agency drives deepening; whale call complicates but doesn’t resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through scrimshaw’s "savage beauty" and "combative tenderness" evolving into protective love. Final image reweights pacification as imprisonment without moralizing. Avoids binaries by embracing cost—freedom requires abandoning guarded safety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "fluid economy of motion," "throne of marrow." Rhythm modulates from weighted dock labor to lyrical call response. No POV drift; lyrical compression taught early (violence "ceased to exist") and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sparse redundancy in "profound, resonant longing" and "spectral silhouette" slightly dilutes momentum. Otherwise, high density: "throne of marrow" compresses sensation. Final line’s "finally free" avoids sentimentality through concrete action (walking into interior).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms pacification trope via "combative tenderness" and sublittoral specificity. Emotional truth in dockworker’s suppressed yearning avoids mystical cliché. Risk-taking in quiet closure lands through scrimshaw’s reprise as discarded map—fresh yet inevitable.</comment>
