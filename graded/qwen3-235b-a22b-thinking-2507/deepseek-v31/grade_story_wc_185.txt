<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority grounded in tactile action ("fingers tracing striations," "listen with fingertips"), but "desperate" motivation leans tell; exhaustion as cost is earned though "terrified heart" metaphor risks therapy-speak in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: "effort leaving her breathless" and transformed caves show cost, with "shape of its aftermath" crystallizing stance; Accumulative lens holds through textural deepening of silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Harmonic caves constrain choice (ripple-marks as mapkeeper's life work, stone's texture guiding method); final water drip charges setting by embodying restored "true music," fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen texturally as "bloom of hush" unfurls, narrowing options to transformation not destruction; cost legible in physical toll, though escalation lacks causal tightening beyond sensory accumulation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reconfiguration: "quiet not absence but presence" avoids moralizing; final line "shape of its aftermath" reweights chaos into tranquility as resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice modulates perfectly under pressure: fragmented sensory focus during conjuring ("not to see, but to listen") shifts to lyrical cadence in closure; no POV slippage, distinct perceptual bias for geology.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "terrified heart" metaphor slightly overwrought but saved by context; zero loops or scaffold, with "bloom" imagery achieving high density without muddle in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ice-crack method transforms trope through specific geology; "quiet as shape of aftermath" synthesizes chaos/peace uniquely. Risks poetic abstraction but earns through tactile execution and emotional truth.</comment>
