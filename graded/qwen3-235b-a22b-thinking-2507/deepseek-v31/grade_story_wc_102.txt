<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; motivation intensifies cleanly but interiority leans abstract ("profound and urgent need") without sufficient embodied struggle during pivotal discovery. Final choice feels earned but lacks visible micro-tactical tradeoffs beyond weeping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "not to keep, but to channel" crystallizes the cost with undeniable conceptual weight. Accumulative lens holds—sensory density builds to the tear's discovery without causal breaks. Orientation anchors (viaduct, twilight) established by line 5.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Viaduct’s wisteria and fog constrain choices (fading light forces urgency, damp brick hides the stone). The camera obscura functions as micro-setting—its projection directly triggers the temple vision shift. Final image of stars against lifted fog recharges the "foggy lucidity" motif with earned clarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by Elara’s agency: tracing the image shifts to temple vision, breathing reveals mantra, stone search follows. Cost is unmistakable—"emotional flood" of compassion to be channeled, not kept. Single tightening (vision-to-reality shift) suffices for length under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of "unused love" as stored compassion resolves through concrete action (clutching the tear), not moralizing. Final image—"artist would become the conduit"—reweights the premise without stating a lesson. Avoids thematic echo; insight emerges from the wisteria-to-lotus transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: artist’s eye filters twilight as "indigo rays," fog as "gauzy." Rhythmic control peaks in vision shift ("lines wavered... shifted into curves"). No head-hopping, but "profound and urgent need" slightly drifts from character lexicon into abstract narration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density ("tear of glycerin and glass rolled down the goddess’s stone cheek"), but "torrent of boundless, unconditional compassion" edges toward overwriting in climax. Final line ("stars appeared... clear and bright") propels closure cleanly. Minor register drift in "profound" weakens peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms spiritual quest trope through camera obscura mechanics and "unused love" as tangible vessel. Emotional specificity in "warmth spread up her arm... not physical heat" avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring the tear’s irreplaceable role in closure.</comment>
