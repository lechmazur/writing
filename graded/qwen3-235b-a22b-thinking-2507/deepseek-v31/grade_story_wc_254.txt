<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (urge to translate vs. knowing paraphrase fails) embodied in "steals her breath" moment; "pure and sharp" motivation phrasing slightly generic but redeemed by visceral fusion climax where barriers dissolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (abandoning paraphrase as artistic identity); Accumulative lens holds through density increase in "barrier between listener and sound dissolves" beat; minor friction that internal cost isn't more viscerally rendered.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cobalt atrium actively charges closure: shifts from "barrier" to "lens" as frozen lake becomes "canvas of captured light"; "lantern-moth hush" evolves from fragile silence to holding verse traces, perfectly constraining her approach.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen under Accumulative lens as "old methods insufficient" tightens options; cost of abandoning paraphrase identity legible in "she is channeling it" shift; slight early vagueness in artistic stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "true art is fusion" shown via light/sound poem, not stated; final image ("endless humming expanse") reweights "sacred boundaries" without moralizing; "sacred" phrasing slightly on-the-nose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cloud-shadow poet" lens); rhythm modulates perfectly from "soft crush of boots" to fragmented fusion climax; "profound need" slightly abstract but redeemed by embodied "tremor of certainty".</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor synonym loop ("dissolve the very lines"/"dissolving boundaries") near start; otherwise clean propulsion with zero scaffold; "pure structured emotion" slightly vague but saved by preceding sensory cascade.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of art/science through sensory fusion; "poem made of light/sound" avoids cliché by being momentary; exile trope transformed by physical dissolution of self; avoids middle-ground hedging.</comment>
