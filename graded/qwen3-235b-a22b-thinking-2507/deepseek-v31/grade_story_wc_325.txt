<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's claustrophobia manifests as embodied sensation ("cold, metallic taste"), not labels, driving her crawl through the tunnel with contradictory impulses (fear vs. duty to the unremembered). Final endurance choice earns cost through prior causality, though "unremembered" motivation could deepen slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Valid Conceptual Repricing closure: testimony replaces data as her burden ("truth carried within her"), with conceptual cost legible in the final sprint. Accumulative lens holds through sensory buildup to phase-transition vision, though tidal pressure escalation feels slightly underdeveloped early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cove's tidal rhythm and claustrophobic tunnel directly constrain choices (crawling under time pressure), while the codex's gold fleck charges the final image. Micro-setting mastery: body (tightening chest) and tool (codex) shape tactics and closure, avoiding generic "jagged teeth" via concrete stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes (uncovering truth vs. survival) tighten meaningfully via tidal clock and claustrophobic tunnel crawl, where visible cost (trembling hands, vision swimming) forecloses retreat. Agency-driven escalation under accumulative lens, though tidal pressure could resonate earlier beyond "time was enemy" setup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of bearing witness emerges through action (codex as key, testimony over data), with final image reweighting "standing by unremembered" as carried truth—no moralizing. CR closure avoids sentimentality, though "unremembered" repetition slightly risks thematic echo without deeper conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("crashing hush," metallic taste) modulates with pressure, but minor filter verbs ("she realized") and uniform stress syntax in climax slightly dull immediacy. Single POV stable; voice compresses effectively under tidal tension without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding loops; high density ("sucking retreat," "frantic hammering") propels momentum. Minor generic phrase ("jagged teeth") redeemed by context, but "river of light" metaphor risks slight overwriting in high-pressure crawl beat without full pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spelunking and signal-hunting tropes via phase transitions and testimony-as-closure. Avoids derivative horror with specific emotional truth (claustrophobia vs. duty), though "phase transitions" concept feels familiar despite strong execution.</comment>
