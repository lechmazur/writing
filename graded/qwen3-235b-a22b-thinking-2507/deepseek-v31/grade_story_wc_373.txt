<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s "foolish" trust versus need for proof; embodied emotion peaks with the sigh as internal fracture. Silas’s silent admission avoids therapy-speak, but the conceptual realization edges toward abstraction without deeper somatic anchoring in the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a flawless Conceptual Repricing: the recorder captures her sigh, reframing "trust breaking" as internal collapse. Hybrid lens (Causal/Accumulative) holds—the search’s false starts tighten options, and the dawn deadline crystallizes Earned Stasis with palpable cost in "weight... no longer burden." Orientation clear by line 15.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mudflats and pier aren’t backdrop but micro-setting: the "glistening" surface enables the recorder’s "wet silence" payoff, charging the final image. Sensory details (salt, decay, spongy ground) filter through Elara’s market-native bias, though occupational depth isn’t demanded at this scale.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally through false starts (search dead ends → knot tightening) and texturally via the dissolving market. Elara’s agency drives the climax—her questioning forces Silas’s gesture, making the sigh’s cost undeniable. Sunrise deadline isn’t just backdrop; it pressures the recorder’s "one charge" constraint.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the final image reweights "trust breaking" as internal collapse without moralizing. Silas’s calloused grip embodies the core question—how shared history betrays—while the recorder’s captured sigh offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Avoids thematic echo despite "comforting unease" repetition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("murmurs vibrating in chest," "spongy ground") reflects Elara’s market-honed senses. Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure—short clauses during confrontation ("He denied it...")—though "comforting unease" repeats slightly, nudging toward scaffold. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts purposefully.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is taut and multi-functional ("rotting pier standing on skeletal legs" establishes decay and tension), but "curiously steadfast" appears verbatim twice. Minor paraphrase loop in opening ("she was the moonshine runner’s daughter... she carried her father’s legacy") costs 0.3. No artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms betrayal trope via the recorder’s conceptual twist—trust breaks internally, not externally. Specific details (bottled tempest, waterlogged pistols) ground freshness, though "pirate market" risks familiarity. Risk-taking (sound-as-proof) heightens stakes without gimmickry, but lacks one irreplaceable flourish for 9.0+.</comment>
