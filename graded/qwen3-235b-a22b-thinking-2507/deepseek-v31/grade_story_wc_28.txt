<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (steel vs. empathy) act in scene through micro-choices like the deliberate tessera insertion. Final renaming choice is earned by vision reliving, but the woman’s off-page presence slightly weakens embodied conflict despite strong internal causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable conceptual cost: renaming history reconfigures meaning via "painful, beautiful admission." Lens holds as accumulative/textural—pressure deepens through sensory density in the vision beat without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tessera functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (bone tool necessity) and charges the final image ("cradled the fragile, enduring weight"). Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: ozone and cortisol details narrow perception during crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (renaming history) tightens via protagonist agency: inserting the tessera into the gauntlet forces a trade-off (exposing truth vs. official records). Cost is legible in "painful, beautiful admission," though escalation lacks one visible tactical shift beyond the broadcast.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image ("shattered sky... new, gentler light") reweights mercy as "radical glitch" without moralizing. Theme emerges through the tessera’s physicality and renaming action—no thematic echo, just earned resonance in the "warm coldness of truth" reprise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("warm coldness," "cradled empathy in arms of steel") modulates under pressure; rhythm accelerates during vision with fragmented syntax. No head-hopping, and the "warm coldness" leitmotif teaches its pattern early for payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffolding; "warm coldness" reprise avoids synonym churn by deepening meaning. One paraphrase loop ("He broadcast... He attached...") slightly dulls momentum, but closure beat ("fragile, enduring weight") achieves crystalline propulsion without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synthesizes "aberrant mercy" with retrocognition into a fresh moral calculus: renaming history as rebellion. Bold risk in accumulative structure pays off through the tessera’s specificity—transforming a trope into inevitable emotional truth without safety-hedging.</comment>
