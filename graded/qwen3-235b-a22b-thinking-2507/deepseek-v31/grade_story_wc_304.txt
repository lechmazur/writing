<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority deeply embodied but lacks contradictory impulses in peak moments; geomancer remains a vessel for theme rather than a character with competing desires. No micro-choices during the threshold crossing reveal hierarchical values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the final pulse of green light crystallizes options with visceral cost (breath/heart cessation). Accumulative lens holds through ritual deepening without causal breaks; aurora's "silent music" reweights oblivion with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Skyborne grotto under aurora constrains every choice—the emerald's refraction depends on auroral light, and the setting directly charges the final image. Micro-setting (emerald's fractures) becomes essential environment, avoiding symbolic convenience through causal pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via deepening ritual: capturing the spark requires crossing the threshold, narrowing options to pure essence. Cost is legible in bodily stillness ("breathing halting, heart pausing"), with agency driving the deepening under Accumulative lens; no coincidences resolve pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image ("one brilliant note from the symphony before eternal quiet") offers resonant non-literal answer to oblivion, reweighting the geomancer's request through captured light. Zero moralizing; theme emerges solely from concrete ritual without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "lucidly watchful" filters all details through energy sensitivity. Rhythm modulates from hushed preparation to crystalline stillness, with patterned elision ("the world fell away") taught early and paid off in closure. No POV leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences like "a memory of the man striking a chisel against unyielding granite" do triple duty (character/world/theme). Final line’s "keeper of last lights" achieves textural specificity without muddying closure’s cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms mortician trope through skyborne grotto and "beautician for the dead" specificity. Emerald-as-soul-capture device synthesizes geology/spirituality organically; risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
