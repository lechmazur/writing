<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority avoids labels ("profound acceptance" over "she accepted"), embodied emotion in "borrowed heartbeat" exchange, but flaws lack visible struggle; calmness reads as competence without vulnerability during critical pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with dissolution cost ("drained but serene"), but lens ambiguity (hybrid vs accumulative) past midpoint weakens escalation; bell tolls tighten options but life-force cost lacks visceral specificity at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism parapet constrains every choice—rain droplets as pigment, wet stone for life-force transfer—and charges final image; sensory specificity ("scent of impossible roses") avoids cliché while deepening thematic stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Agency-driven escalation through mirage stabilization ("borrowed heartbeat" pulse) narrows options under bell pressure, with visible cost in energy depletion; dominant stake (temporal fragility of possibility) intensifies organically via protagonist’s choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (mirrors showing "a path not taken"), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "dusky harmony" as conceptual cost of ephemeral beauty without stating philosophy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("prism parapet after rain," "coded lullabies") modulates rhythm under pressure; lyric compression taught early pays off in closure, though "perceptively calm" slightly flattens stress response.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Masterful density ("fractured its light into a thousand faint, spectral tears") but adjacent paraphrase ("shimmering, half-formed vision"/"wavering like heat haze") triggers -0.2; no closure-impacting artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical realism with sensory precision; "borrowed heartbeat" transforms trope through concrete stakes (temporal cost), avoiding derivative execution while heightening emotional specificity.</comment>
