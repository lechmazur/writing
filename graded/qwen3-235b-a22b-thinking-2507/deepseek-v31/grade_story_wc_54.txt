<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "functional creativity" vs perceived insubordination; embodied "stoic wonder" avoids label-speak. Final choice earned by prior causality, though "equations for hope" edges toward abstraction before concrete action saves it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with clean escalation: sextant discovery → alignment → power reroute → transformation. Cost proof solid ("gears groaned in protest after decades of stillness"), but slight abstraction in "equations for hope" line dilutes visceral impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Terminal actively constrains choices (sextant calibration matching architecture) and charges closure via starlight-flooded atrium. Micro-setting (conduit, capacitors) directly alters tactics, satisfying 9+ gate requirement flawlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (resurrection vs demolition) tightens through Elara's agency: carnival's capacitors become crucial resource. Cost is visceral ("gears groaned") and reconfigures options when walls move, though moral calculus could deepen slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through concrete action ("resurrected not just machinery, but potential"). Final image ("silence... full of waiting") reweights premise without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite near-miss with "equations for hope" abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature blends engineer's precision ("calibrated curve," "residual charge") with lyricism. Rhythmic control under pressure ("Conduits hummed. Gears groaned.") modulates voice without elision issues; tension in sentence cadence mirrors hydraulic strain.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "grimy ceramite tiles" shows textural specificity without scaffold. Minor deduction for "stoic wonder" repetition (para 2/8), but contextual variation ("quiet hum" vs "quiet triumph") prevents loop penalty. Zero figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "abandoned place" trope through specific engineering logic (sextant as hydraulic key). Emotional truth in "resurrected potential" avoids generic hope; capacitor rerouting feels inevitable yet fresh. Safety middle avoided via bold structural resurrection.</comment>
