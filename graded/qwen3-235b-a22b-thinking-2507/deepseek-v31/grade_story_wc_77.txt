<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s fragile strength paradox, but the advisor’s role as pure plot device slightly undermines relationship-as-crucible; micro-choices like selecting "Heart" entry feel earned under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: crumbling photograph and fading luminance crystallize cost; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through paradox escalation without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Opera cloak clasp evolves from symbolic burden to mundane object, constraining Elias’s final choice; funhouse decay actively pressures tactics ("shuddered" during writing attempts).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single stake (survival via paradox) tightens through three dictionary entries; cost visible in physical decay (crumbling photo, imploding mirror) under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "tricked it into revealing it was nothing" avoids moralizing; final image of clasp as "simply a piece of metal" reweights fear’s power without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct ("repulsive allure of surroundings"); rhythmic control shifts from fragmented terror to measured resolve during paradox writing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; "lingering luminance" and "discarded opera cloak clasp" achieve high density; final line recharges motifs without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carnival decay and linguistic paradox; risks unconventional resolution (fear collapsing via logic) that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
