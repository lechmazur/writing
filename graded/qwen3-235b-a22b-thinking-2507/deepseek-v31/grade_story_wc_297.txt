<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (dread/hope) drive her to cut herself; embodied scars make the final choice inevitable. No therapy-speak in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost (fresh incision); Accumulative lens holds as eclipse timing tightens pressure. Cost proof in "a fresh line of pain".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Scars function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges final image; "cobalt embrace" filters all perception without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single tightening (early eclipse) narrows options under Accumulative lens; cost is legible in the incision that "completed the pattern".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Final image reweights "root-bound" as strength without stating theme; scars-as-connection avoids moralizing while charging closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("silent alarm", "geometry of meaning") modulates under stress; no head-hopping despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; "anxious elation" gains meaning through recurrence. Final line crystallizes theme without abstraction: "she was its anchor".</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "chosen one" trope via scars-as-connection; specific details (twin moons, waxy clipping) avoid generic fantasy while risking quiet climax.</comment>
