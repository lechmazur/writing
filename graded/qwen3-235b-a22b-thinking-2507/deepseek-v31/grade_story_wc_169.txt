<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lacks internal contradiction; motivation is clear but one-note. "Logical dreamer" trait manifests in actions yet shows no competing impulses (e.g., fear of failure vs. hope-seeking), weakening the final choice’s earnedness despite strong embodied focus on the altitude gauge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: the released balloons embody "conditions for hope’s germination" as a tool/seed, reweighting the premise through the grotto’s mosaic. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—density peaks when parallel timelines converge into harmonic series.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Grotto walls and tide-polished stone create vivid atmosphere but don’t constrain choices (e.g., tides never disrupt experiments). The altitude gauge qualifies as micro-setting—its "steady readings" directly shape tactics and charge the final image with "approval," narrowly clearing the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quantifying hope’s resurgence) tightens via balloon convergence—a single deepening where resilience/community interplay reveals the equation. Cost is felt in Elara’s frozen breath and quiet purpose, but lacks tangible trade-off (e.g., sacrificing a balloon variable) to enter 9.0 band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: hope as "atmospheric pressure for the soul" crystallizes in the final mosaic of equation-painted balloons. Avoids moralizing; the "blueprint for ascent" reweights prior struggle without stating a moral, fulfilling Q5’s 9+ quick test through resonant imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines—"cartographer of impossibilities" lens filters all description. Rhythmic control peaks in the harmonic series breakthrough ("numbers flowing as a poem"), though "prayer released into the world" slightly drifts into abstract register under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops but "her hand, holding a stylus... froze" creates simultaneity error during high-pressure climax. Figurative language remains precise ("chaotic variables aligned as harmonic series"), yet passive construction dulls immediacy where active voice would heighten tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "mapping hope" trope through tangible physics (balloon altitude, light interplay). The equation-as-seed synthesis feels inevitable, with risk-taking in parallel timelines enriching emotional truth—no safety-hedging, and specificity ("tide-polished grotto") anchors universals.</comment>
