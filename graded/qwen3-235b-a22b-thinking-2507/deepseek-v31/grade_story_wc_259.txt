<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (anguished joy, longing vs. rejection) act simultaneously in pivotal touch of pagoda; renunciation earned through embodied micro-choices like erratic path-shedding certainty. Final choice forecloses dissolution path with visible cost in "mantle" of nostalgia.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance crystallization: her return walk embracing chaos reconfigures options with undeniable cost in "sorrowful, exhilarating love." Accumulative lens holds through pattern-disruption pressure; cost legible in final weeping.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atoms of nostalgia charge closure as tangible "mantle"; archive's pattern-enforcement actively constrains movement (triggers mazes). Micro-setting (saffron veil's flutter) evolves from office badge to symbol of rejected purity, directly shaping final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pressure tightens via Accumulative escalation: erratic movement deepens knowledge while narrowing options. Dominant stake (pursue knowledge vs. preserve self) culminates in pagoda touch that changes understanding with visceral cost—anguish transformed into mantle of loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final line reweights "forbidden knowledge" into non-literal answer: innocence ends by choosing feeling over numbness. Theme emerges from concrete particulars (bronze pagoda's dissolution offer), avoiding moralizing while charging emotional aftereffect through "flawed and lost and real."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in historian's bias: "atoms of nostalgia," "crystalline spires humming history." Rhythmic control under pressure varies cadence (short staccato for vortex, flowing for revelation), with patterned elision ("no sun to cast twilight") taught early and paid at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "discordant drum of anguished joy" compresses emotion without abstraction. Final line propulsion perfect: "wept without shame" crystallizes cost with resonant specificity. Minor deduction for "palpable haze" borderline cliché, redeemed by "atoms" metaphor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "forbidden knowledge" trope through specific mechanics: pattern-disruption requirement and dissolution-as-peace. Risk-taking (lyric archive design) heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional truth in choosing flawed humanity over "numb perfection" feels inevitable.</comment>
