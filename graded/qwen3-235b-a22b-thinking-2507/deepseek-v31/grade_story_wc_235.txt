<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "violently getting jealous of past selves" versus present jadedness, with embodied cost in the gut-punch memory. Slight tell in "motivation... felt like a cruel joke" prevents 9.0, but micro-choices (scroll snap, soaring) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: descent crystallizes options with visible cost ("jealousy gone, burned away by altitude"). Orientation flawless by line 3 ("ranger cabin," "stone marker"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) held through density increase in dream sequence to soaring epiphany.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: birch bark scroll (tool) charges final image ("hand no longer shook") and constrains choice via its "feral nostalgia" threat. Mountain air forces porch escape, enabling climax. Sensory specificity ("loam and cold air") mirrors internal state without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chaos vs. narrative control) tightens via dream confrontation with past selves, narrowing options to soar or suffocate. Protagonist agency drives climax ("spread arms... imperative"), but dream incursion edges toward coincidence complicating escalation. Cost unmistakable: burned jealousy reconfigures final stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through tapestry metaphor ("chaos wasn’t something to be distilled; it was the point"). Avoids moralizing; final image of writing "not to distill, but to finally understand" reweights prior struggle without stated moral. "Weary awe" avoids sentimentality through earned specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "yearning so raw and untamed it had teeth" and rhythm shifts from fragmented ("Time... suggestion") to soaring cadence during flight. Minor register drift in "chronologically confused" label, but voice modulates perfectly under pressure with taught compression ("She unrolled the scroll...").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "gravity’s tether cut by pure, undiluted yearning" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Final line’s rhythmic cadence ("not to distill, but to finally understand") recharges motif without muddle. Slight cliché in "bitter laugh escaped" avoided major penalty due to peak-beat clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "seeing your grave" trope via lucid dream chronicler lens; "feral nostalgia" concept feels fresh and necessary. Risk-taking in soaring-as-narrative-force heightens stakes, but epiphany structure slightly familiar. Specificity of birch bark scroll and "weary awe" avoids derivative safety.</comment>
