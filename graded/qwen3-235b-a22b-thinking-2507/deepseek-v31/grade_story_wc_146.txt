<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in key beats; "infinitely patient" shown but not tested under stress. Motivation clear yet unconflicted, missing micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Final endurance earned but cost remains conceptual rather than embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: archway's glow halts collapse with undeniable conceptual cost ("unmade, erased from reality"). Accumulative lens holds consistently through resonant deepening. Cost proof solid in "impending collapse halted" reconfiguring stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ebony tuning fork functions as essential micro-setting, constraining every choice and charging the final image ("humming softly in its wild hush"). Cobblestones evolve causally from "discordant shiver" to resonance conductor. Archway's physical transformation proves environment shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten relentlessly under Accumulative lens: each failed vibration ("discordant shiver") deepens the erasure threat until the square breakthrough. Agency in rhythmic patterns narrows options to this method alone. Conceptual cost of unmaking is unmistakable in the archway's stabilization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Wild hush" transforms from "trembling on edge of scream" to "vibrant ballet" then "eternal memory humming," offering non-literal resolution to restoration. Avoids moralizing; final image reweights silence as active harmony without stated theme. Earned complexity in "not as it was, but as it needed to be."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("songs hidden inside silence," "stone dropped into still pond of quiet") with rhythmic control under pressure ("Tap-step. Hum-step. Pause-step"). Purposeful compression taught early pays off in closure. Minor slip: "physician diagnosing comatose giant" slightly overwrites.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; high density with "leather-wrapped palm" and "dry fountain" specifics. Slight register drift in "memory of pain" borders therapy-speak. Final paragraph's "as it needed to be" risks thematic echo but avoids moralizing through concrete image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms ghost town trope through sonic restoration: "rebuild with resonance" feels inevitable yet fresh. Bold Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details like "leather-wrapped palm" ground abstraction. Emotional truth in patience paying "dividend" avoids generic templates.</comment>
