<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "borrowed personalities" armor versus hollow core is embodied through micro-choices like wrenching away the fragment; final weeping earned by prior quantification obsession. No stock phrasing—emotions as "tallied debt" and "soaring integer" feel character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "hollow proof" crystallizes the mathematical metaphor while the vanishing stars externalize the irreversible loss. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density peaks as borrowed personalities flood her, narrowing options to self-confrontation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Topaz workshop constrains choice via the letterpress (tool-as-setting), but stars lack active pressure beyond backdrop. Final image of "vanishing stars" charges closure by mirroring her emotional void, though micro-setting could deepen tactical constraints earlier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: pressing the fragment inward transforms abstract loneliness into visceral, destabilizing feedback. Cost is unmistakable in "profound emptiness at her own core," but escalation lacks one tangible loss (e.g., fragment damage) to tighten tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete math metaphors—"zero sum," "cacophony of stolen laughs"—avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights the premise: quantification reveals hollowness, not mastery, offering non-literal answer to "mathematics of emotion" without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "neat column of grief tallied like a debt"; rhythmic control modulates under stress (short clauses during transposition). No dialogue, but internal voice remains distinct—e.g., "laughed, a sharp foreign sound" reflects her fractured self.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Lucid turbulence" risks therapy-speak but is redeemed by immediate embodiment ("clarity so sharp it was painful"). Minor synonym churn in "borrowed personalities" section (-0.2), but zero loops in climax where "cacophony of stolen laughs" drives propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mathematical empathy with letterpress craft feels inevitable—no generic "empathy device." Bold risk in making quantification the path to self-annihilation, transforming trope through specific, verifiable detail like the "crescent of cold white light" humming numerically.</comment>
