<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (curse vs. gift of psychometry) drives micro-choices; embodied emotions avoid labels. Slight underdevelopment in spatial imagination's cost beyond "symphony of abandoned joy" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("beating heart" releasing love) lands with undeniable conceptual cost under Accumulative lens. Orientation anchors by line 3; pressure tightens through emotional density escalation without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Film reel as micro-setting constrains choice (threading) and charges final image (light cutting dust). Projection booth's tactile details (hot metal, perforations) evolve with plot, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("find unused love") tightens through psychometric immersion; agency crystallizes in projection choice. Conceptual cost (love was archived, not lost) reweights options without physical sacrifice, fitting length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from film reel's transformation: "unused love" becomes "archived" then "pumping" in final image. Avoids moralizing; "most beautiful goodbye" earns resonance through prior particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("navigable landscapes," "hushed thunder" motif) modulates under pressure. Minor deduction for slight repetition of "hushed thunder" in Henderson's face and revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "scratch of his pen the only sound" exemplifies high-density propulsion. One hairline slip: "psychometry reading" slightly redundant, but closure image ("beating heart") remains pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "unsent letters" trope through film reel medium; spatial imagination angle feels fresh. Risk-taking in quiet ending pays off via sensory accumulation, avoiding derivative middle-ground choices.</comment>
