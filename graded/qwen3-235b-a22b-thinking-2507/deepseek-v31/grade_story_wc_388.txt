<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Elara abandons debunking for protection, embodied through tactile choices like securing tent flaps amid storm. Flawed motivation ("compulsion she could not ignore") deepens without safety-hedging as radiation grit literally invades her goggles during crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds perfectly: storm density intensifies pressure toward Earned Stasis closure. Cost legible in "she wouldn't extract the diamond," crystallizing abandonment of her life's work with visible stakes. No causality breaks despite reflective shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Radioactive grit and orchard actively constrain choices—trapping Elara mid-storm, charging final "scoured landscape" image. Sickly green leaves vs orange haze creates sensory hierarchy that mirrors her internal shift from skepticism to revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through storm escalation forcing Elara's stance crystallization. Dominant "truth vs comfort" conflict resolves via renunciation with felt cost: her life's work dies as she chooses orchard's survival over exposure, altering tactics permanently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through shredded letters → stillpoint realization without moralizing. Final image reweights "comfortable lies" as necessary sanctuary, avoiding binaries by showing truth's weaponization risk through researcher's hidden panic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("goggles dusted with radioactive grit") filters all details through debunker's lens. Syntax compresses under stress ("world dissolved into howling brown") while maintaining distinct rhythm; no register drift during storm climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sizzled with static" shows textural specificity. Final line's propulsion ("orchard could continue to live") avoids closure muddle. Minor density dip in reflective block stays within BRR limits.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "cursed object" trope via scientific framing—flawed diamond as radiation nullifier. Emotional truth in choosing comfort over truth feels inevitable through prior particulars like settlers' "cushion against reality."</comment>
