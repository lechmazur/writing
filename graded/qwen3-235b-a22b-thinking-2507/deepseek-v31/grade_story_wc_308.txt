<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Zephyr analyzing birds' panic as data while her "weathered resolve... strained," but flaw compounding lacks specificity—how her stillness obsession directly caused the crisis isn't dramatized before resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the pulse's release creates "foundational silence" that reconfigures the canyon's meaning with felt cost (muscles trembling, overturned philosophy), holding the Accumulative/Textural lens through sonic density escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The bone towers actively constrain choices—their fissure location dictates the climax action—and the arrowhead's sonic properties charge the final wave; "layered dust" library concept nearly elevates to micro-setting but lacks mid-scene tactical impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Zephyr's agency: birds' flight deepens understanding, arrowhead repurposed from striking to levering, but the physical/emotional cost of her choice ("breathing deeply") feels undercharged in the final image per band requirements.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action—birds/arrowhead/dust revealing interconnectedness—avoiding moralizing; the "wave of perfect silence" reweights her stillness obsession non-literally, though "understanding what movement truly meant" flirts with thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Distinct sonic perceptual signature ("frantic, chaotic tremor") modulates under pressure, but "weathered resolve" is label-only feeling violating embodied emotion rules in peak crisis beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is largely immaculate, but the closure beat's mixed metaphor—"a wave of perfect, foundational silence that was not an absence of sound, but its source"—creates coherence break, triggering -0.5 artifact penalty per Text-Artifact Screen.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms navigation tropes through specific sonic mechanics (bone resonance, arrowhead tone), but the obsidian arrowhead's archetypal weight slightly dilutes freshness; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
