<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction crystallizes in pivotal shift from nostalgic Earth sketches to fluid nebula charting; embodied motivation ("fingers stiff with nostalgia... now flew") shows value hierarchy reconfiguration with visible cost of abandoning home as true north.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: "He was no longer lost" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (relinquishing Earth as anchor), perfectly aligned with Accumulative/Textural lens where observation density creates irreversible reconfiguration; cost legible in "true north was not behind him".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Time dilation observation deck functions as essential micro-setting: the dome’s physics enables the nebula discovery, while the compass rose evolves from relic to charged closure image ("no longer just a relic; it was a promise"), directly constraining the protagonist’s final cartographic choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake escalation through Accumulative lens: quiet observation deepens into cosmic revelation where the temporal stretch trait (not coincidence) enables the pivotal glimpse, narrowing options from nostalgic remembrance to active charting with felt cost of abandoning Earth’s skies as navigational anchor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reconfiguration: "true north" shifts from internal metaphor to literal cosmic pathway in final sketching act, avoiding moralizing while resonating via "first and only cartographer of deep time" – a non-literal answer to disorientation that reweights prior exile.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in rhythm modulation: lyrical compression ("time was no longer a river but a sluggish sea") tightens under discovery pressure ("His breath caught"), with zero POV slippage; syntactic control mirrors temporal stretch through deliberate pacing variations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "soft scratch of charcoal... defiant against the great, echoed silence" achieves maximum density with rhythmic propulsion. Minor deduction for "profound quiet so complete it rang" (slight cliché), but closure image ("map was just beginning") recharges opening exile flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms isolation trope through specific physics: temporal stretch isn’t decorative but the discovery mechanism, with emotional truth in choosing cosmic purpose over nostalgia. Freshness anchored in verifiable detail (time dilation enabling nebula observation) rather than abstract novelty.</comment>
