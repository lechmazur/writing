<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction under pressure is subtle but present (systematic routine vs. urgent search); embodied emotion strong ("quiet dread settled in her chest"), though micro-choices lack layered conflict during crisis. Final rekindling choice is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the fragile hope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: mended chime and glowing orchid crystallize the cost (regret edged with hope) under Causal lens. Orientation clear by line 3 ("opal library above clouds"), but bamboo crack widening feels slightly convenient as escalation without deepening stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Opal library and bamboo tube constrain choices (search for vial, breathing technique) and charge the final image (light-sealed crack, radiant orchid). Micro-setting specificity ("milk-white stone shelves," "swirl of silver mist") avoids white-room syndrome while serving the central conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving Lyra's name) tightens meaningfully via bamboo crack widening, but escalation lacks deepening—no new complications arise from the search. Cost is legible (regret transforming to fragile hope), yet pressure remains static without Aeliana's tactics adapting to fresh obstacles.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "rekindled" echoes as defiance against silence. Final image ("defiant spark against immense dark") offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting the premise through Aeliana's resumed work rather than abstract assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tasted of old rain and forgotten promises") and rhythmic control under pressure ("a fine crack... threatened permanent silence"). Purposeful compression taught early (library's nature) pays off in closure; zero head-hopping despite lyrical density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("silver luminescence streamed from her, a wordless melody given form"). Minor register drift in "forgotten promises" slightly jars lexicon but doesn't dull closure. Propulsion flawless through syntax variation (short staccato during urgency, flowing during search).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis: crystalline orchids sustained by memory transforms "preserving legacy" trope through specific mechanics (vibration physics, internal light). Risk-taking (mist-as-song becoming light) heightens stakes coherently without gimmickry; emotional truth anchors universality.</comment>
