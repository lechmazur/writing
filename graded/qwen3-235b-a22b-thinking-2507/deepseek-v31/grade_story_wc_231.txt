<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (isolation vs connection) act in scene; final flower transfer earns closure with visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; embodied grief in "red-rimmed but clear" eyes and "borrowed memory" transfer.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "shared, borrowed memory settled between them" crystallizes stakes with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds; cost proof evident in final image reweighting Emil's journey.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Opal dock functions as micro-setting charging closure: its "milky light" becomes the vessel for memory transfer. Edelweiss constrains choice (Silas keeps/returns it), charging final image with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Silas' agency: his waiting tightens options until woman's arrival reconfigures meaning. Cost is legible in "borrowed memory" charge; single deepening (gesture reinterpretation) sufficient under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: Edelweiss shifts from "question mark" to "lighthouse," avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "curator of absence" into shared witness, offering non-literal answer to memory's persistence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("curator of absence," "silence was a text") modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control in closure beat ("story of love that was, at last, complete") taught through accumulative pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("a composer, his mind failing, stealing the music from him note by note"). Final line recharges "opal dock" motif without figurative muddle; propulsion maintained through tight syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "borrowed memories" transforms lighthouse trope via Emil's navigation metaphor. Risk-taking (accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity in Edelweiss-as-lighthouse avoids abstraction.</comment>
