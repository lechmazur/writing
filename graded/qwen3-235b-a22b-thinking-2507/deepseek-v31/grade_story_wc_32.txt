<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is concrete ("mask of granite patience over deep well of feeling") but peak transformation lacks layered irrationality; the epiphany feels too clean without visible struggle between preservation instinct and destructive urge during the act.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "no longer hopeless" and the Nexus's deepening twilight reconfigure stagnation into possibility through accumulated textural pressure, not causal beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The crozier and dross function as micro-setting charging the final image, but the Ember Nexus backdrop remains atmospheric rather than constraining Alder's physical choices during creation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes viscerally escalate through Alder's iterative agency under Accumulative lens; the cost of hopelessness shattered is felt in "no longer hopeless" and the Nexus's shudder, though no secondary physical toll narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action ("not rebuilding... cultivating new power") with final image reweighting stagnation into possibility without moralizing; subtle ambiguity in whether the helix's "connection" risks new dogma.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in alchemist-specific noticing ("dross from forgotten experiments"), with rhythmic compression under pressure ("He didn't fuse... subjected them") avoiding any voice contamination.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "chaotic bloom of light in the frozen twilight" exemplifies high-density propulsion where every phrase advances atmosphere and stakes without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms alchemy tropes through specific, grounded choices (dross as "evidence of failure," helix refusing symbolism); emotional truth in "begged it to become" avoids generic rebellion arc.</comment>
