<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "lies born from necessity" vs. "inherited sin was silence"; embodied emotion in teeth-aching vibration and "whispered into intricate weave" avoids labels. Final choice earned by prior causality with visible cost ("last bodies yet to be found"). Slight abstraction in "inherited sin" phrasing barely edges toward stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Warden's dissipation into "sigh of acceptance" reconfigures stakes with undeniable conceptual cost ("final secret kept, last bodies yet to be found"). Orientation clear by line 3 ("small, rocky island... lighthouse prison"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density escalation to resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting object (lattice) constrains choice and charges final image: "tucked inside his coat" crystallizes earned hush. "Copperlight repose" and "tasted of dust" filter through Kaelen's urgency, evolving with pressure from metallic tranquility to peaceful silence. Recurring object directly shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominate stake ("before they find the bodies") tightens decisions under Accumulative lens: Warden's advance forces truth-speaking with visible cost (bodies remain hidden). Kaelen's agency drives escalation via micro-choices (prying lattice, whispering truths). Cost proof solid in "final secret kept, last bodies yet to be found" image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "loneliness that breeds falsehoods" reframed by lattice-filtered truths. Final image ("genuine, peaceful silence") offers non-literal answer to "chasing hush" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; complexity in "fear that sustains impossibilities" resonates through action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "copperlight repose" and "tasted of dust"; rhythmic control intensifies under pressure ("He spoke another, and another"). Voice modulates from metallic tranquility to crystalline clarity. Minor abstraction in "inherited sin" slightly disrupts lexical consistency mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; high density in "coalescence of gloom and memory that defied the chapel’s solid reality". Final line ("leaving the lighthouse prison behind... final secret kept") recharges motifs cleanly. One paraphrase loop ("chasing hush, the profound quiet") triggers minimal momentum drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms cry-wolf trope via specific logic: lies sustain "impossibilities," truth requires lattice-filtering. Emotional truth in "fear that sustains impossibilities" avoids generic templates. Risk-taking (Warden of Echoes) heightens stakes coherently; "bodies yet to be found" grounds universality in visceral detail.</comment>
