<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong (scheming pacifist), but "resentment for this break" risks diagnostic label-speak; cellular memory motivation clear yet embodiment lacks visceral grit during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with crystallized cost (single note hanging), but conceptual cost feels slightly abstract; Accumulative lens holds though orientation anchors by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sanctuary breathes and pulses, charging final image, yet stone/air resonance doesn't actively constrain choices; micro-setting (music box) vital but environment lacks tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lyra’s cellular memory appeal driving Kael’s surrender, but protagonist agency slightly over-reliant on exposition; cost (note hanging) legible yet abstract for high-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "memory as anchor" resolution; final melody reweights resentment without moralizing, though "bitter hold" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("palpable void," "glitching air") with rhythmic control under pressure; zero head-hopping, voice modulates perfectly from unnerving silence to crystallized note.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ghostly melody" achieves high density without muddle; final line’s "new, magnificent pattern" propels closure with crystalline precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pacifist rebellion + cellular memory mechanics, but "broken pin" trope slightly familiar; risk-taking elevates stakes yet proximity to fantasy conventions caps score.</comment>
