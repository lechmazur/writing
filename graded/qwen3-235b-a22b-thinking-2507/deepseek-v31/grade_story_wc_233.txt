<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("threat for her soul" vs fortified borders) and embodied emotion ("skin slick with cold sweat") drive the climb; micro-choice dismissing guards reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost (abandoning royal decorum for truth).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "The crown felt no heavier, but its meaning had transformed" crystallizes the conceptual repricing; Accumulative lens holds as sensory density ("bleeding starlight cooling as knowledge") reweights stakes without causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cobalt grotto functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (must enter to witness communion) and charges the final image ("piece of night sky woven into her soul"); sensory selection ("crystalline substance that hummed") reflects urgency by narrowing to tactile immediacy during the starlight event.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency: her climb intensifies pressure until the starlight's "tears" force reinterpretation; dominant stake (spiritual disenchantment vs cosmic connection) tightens via deepening knowledge shift ("not an attack; it was a communion"), with cost legible in her prior blindness dissolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the grotto's reweighted meaning: final image of fireflies over gardens offers non-literal answer to "disenchantment" without moralizing; avoids abstraction by rooting wisdom in "shared exhale" sensory particulars rather than epiphanies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lacy menace," "cobalt abyss") filters all description; rhythmic control under pressure shifts from anxious fragments ("waiting for calamity") to awed cadence ("silvery, incandescent tears welled") without syntactic monotony or POV leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "geothermal fire" and "liquid light" achieve high density without muddle; final line ("forever connected") resolves via image recharging "bleeding starlight" with conceptual cost, avoiding overwriting even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "cosmic communion" trope through queen's disenchantment and cobalt grotto specificity; avoids derivative safety by grounding the "bleeding starlight" in embodied stakes (her soul, not kingdom), though emotional truth edges out radical structural risk.</comment>
