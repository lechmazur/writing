<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority shines through concrete actions like tracing the leaf's veins, but epiphany lacks sufficient struggle; "circuitously sincere" triggers diagnostic label penalty (-0.5) during pivotal realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with the linden leaf under glass, but "reluctant metamorphosis" concept isn't fully earned through causality; one distinct non-closure issue (-0.8) applied.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mossy trellis and linden leaf function as micro-setting that charges the final image; sensory details like "wet earth and ozone" constrain choices through embodied perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Storm pressure tightens meaningfully toward release, but dominant stake (predicting growth) lacks tangible cost beyond frustration; escalation under Accumulative lens strong but stakes feel abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Growth is not a problem to be solved" risks thematic echo but redeems through concrete "map of possibilities" reconfiguration; final leaf image offers resonant non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "vines trembling with anticipation" shows selective POV bias; rhythmic control shifts from sterile data to organic observation under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor abstraction ("perpetually on the cusp of becoming") in early storm description; otherwise zero loops with high density, though "sustaining transformation" repetition borders on scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scientific rigidity vs. organic acceptance feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet closure elevates but "reluctant metamorphosis" phrasing lacks specificity for 9.0.</comment>
