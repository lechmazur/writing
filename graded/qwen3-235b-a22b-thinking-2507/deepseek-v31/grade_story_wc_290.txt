<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority avoids labels via concrete embodiment ("clammy dread," "knuckles white"); micro-choice (compass plunge) crystallizes contradictory impulses (fear vs. precision) with visible cost in trembling breath. Final endurance of claustrophobia earns stakes without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: spatial mutiny resolves into crystallized key, reframing fear as "a promise." Accumulative lens holds through organ note’s textural escalation; cost legible in "chilled fingers" warming to key’s power. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Compass constrains every choice—tracing energy lines, anchoring mutiny, becoming key’s template. Final image ("walls no longer felt like a prison") charges setting with earned thematic weight. Sensory specificity ("silver eels," "tar-thick air") avoids white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single stake (surviving spatial mutiny to find key) tightens via organ note’s textural escalation; protagonist agency drives climax (compass plunge forecloses escape). Cost unmistakable in "trembling breath" against "crushing reality," though mutiny’s origin lacks deeper causal layer.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: "marrying precision to chaos" reweights claustrophobia without moralizing. Final line ("mapped the space inside her own fear") offers resonant CR, charging key’s discovery with earned wisdom. Zero thematic echo or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust-thick blanket," "marrow of her bones") modulates under stress. Sentence compression during mutiny ("The walls seemed to breathe...") heightens pressure. Minor register drift in "wistful rebellion" risks abstraction but recovers in action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("discordant note shuddered... vibrated in the marrow"). Final line’s cadence ("prison, but a promise") crystallizes theme. Slight overwriting in "full-scale rebellion of matter" (redundant with "spatial mutiny") dulls one beat’s immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "magical key" trope via crystallized sound mechanics. Specificity (brass compass → starlight key) avoids generic fantasy. Risk-taking (textural spatial mutiny) heightens stakes coherently; emotional truth in fear’s endurance overcomes.</comment>
