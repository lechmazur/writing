<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation deepens through embodied action (unsnap tremors), but early "capture possibility" feels slightly told; queen vision retroactively grounds interior conflict with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly (armor removal = path foreclosure), but cost ("weight lifted") lacks sufficient physical embodiment in final beat to justify 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard actively constrains choices (paths rearrange, threads bind marionette); glowing flora pulses guide movement, charging the final "canvas of shivering bliss" image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via reality shift (paths rearrange) forcing Valerius deeper; "Choose and complete" crystallizes pressure, but queen vision’s emotional cost isn’t viscerally paid during the unsnap act itself.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through orchard’s "forgotten patterns" reconfigured by liberation; final image ("simply a man") resonates without moralizing, though "shape of possibility" risks slight abstraction early.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dull, withdrawn knight’s shell," "phosphorescent leaf") modulates under pressure; no head-hopping, lyrical compression taught early and paid in closure’s "shifting, beautiful dark."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor label-speak ("shivering bliss") in high-pressure beat slightly dulls closure; otherwise impeccable rhythm and density (e.g., "threads of light flowed into it" crystallizes transformation).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms knight/marionette tropes through alchemical specificity ("wire and woven shadow"); "liberation not destruction" reconfiguration feels earned, though queen motif borders on familiar.</comment>
