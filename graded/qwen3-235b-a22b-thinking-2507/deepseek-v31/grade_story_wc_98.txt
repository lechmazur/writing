<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("luminous doubt") manifests concretely through failing instruments and cheese-eating exhaustion; final choice to "wake" the seed earns renunciation of empiricism with visible cost in methodology shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise (ridge's eternal bloom holding memory) with conceptual cost (empiricism's failure), but dream origin lacks full causal anchoring under Accumulative/Textural lens dominant at end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (monsoon deadline forces ridge ascent) and charges closure: flowers transform from "impossible bloom" to living memory vessels in final golden-light radiance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through monsoon's approach and failed verification; protagonist's agency in shifting from planting to waking creates decisive trade-off (empirical methods abandoned) with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through seed's metamorphosis from "lockbox" to "key," reweighting memory as living invitation; final image ("ridge would remember everything") answers central question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct "empirically whimsical" voice filters all perception ("dusty work," instruments "whirred skeptically"); rhythmic control deepens under monsoon pressure with zero POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "golden light radiated outward" crystallizes closure with textural precision. Minor deduction for triple repetition of "luminous doubt" slightly diluting peak-beat density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "reality checker" role transforms memory-preservation trope; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes through dream conduit without gimmickry.</comment>
