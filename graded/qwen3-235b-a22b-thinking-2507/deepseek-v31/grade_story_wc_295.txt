<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her healing gift failing self-application, but "heals with words" lacks active mid-beat constraint despite thematic payoff; final choice to write earns closure with visceral cost in "mantle of leaden stars" to purpose shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: her narrative act reconfigures cosmic dread into shared purpose with felt cost in "burden seen and shared"; causal lens holds from dream intention to telescope verification without disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Observatory tools charge closure: the pen (echoing telegram's medium) transforms academic impulse into healing narrative; ozone-scented "midnight solace" atmosphere constrains her solace-seeking sleep decision early.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes viscerally tighten as telescope verification narrows options from static translation to temporal star-pulse tracking; cost crystallizes when glyphs reveal "dimming" requiring communal vigil, not individual triumph.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through inscriptions as "celestial score" reframing apocalypse into cyclical purpose; final image ("shared burdens met in quiet solstice") resonates without moralizing, reweighting "midnight solace" into active unity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: "frustration a sharp stone in her gut" embodies emotion through astronomer's lexicon; rhythmic compression during telescope rush ("hands flying over star charts") heightens pressure without voice slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding: "pinpoints of light flared and dimmed in rhythmic dance" fuses action/image/theme; final line’s "quiet solstice" recharges dawn motif with conceptual density, no figurative muddle in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: variable stars as syntax transforms temple trope into temporal communal clock; emotional specificity in grief-driven decoding avoids abstraction, with risk-taking dream logic heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
