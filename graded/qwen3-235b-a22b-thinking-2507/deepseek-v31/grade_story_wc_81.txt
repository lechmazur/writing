<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas' obsession with "honest origins" manifests in concrete micro-choices (re-examining the stamp handle) under pressure. Contradictory impulses—logic vs. doubt in "dappled resolve"—drive the climax without diagnostic labels. Slight deduction for minimal embodied emotion during discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the ink blot's "unmistakable" match crystallizes truth with conceptual cost (sanitized history exposed). Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly—sensory deepening (groans/drips) tightens pressure toward the vault revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The sunken library actively constrains choices: darkness necessitates touch-based navigation, water damage creates fragile evidence, and the ink stamp (micro-setting) unlocks the vault. Final image of the "modest and direct" charter charges the setting’s thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Silas’ agency: the ledger’s dead end forces his "alternative hypothesis," narrowing options to the stamp. Cost is undeniable—the conceptual price of truth (sanitized history exposed) reshapes his final stance within the reclaimed stillness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the stamp’s "simpler, cruder design" versus the "ornate seal" reweights truth’s value. Final image of the ink blot delivers non-literal resonance without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Silas notices "minute groans" and "rhythm of breath" reflecting his tranquilly perceptive nature. Rhythmic control shifts from measured cataloging ("brass handle of a specific drawer") to urgent discovery ("heart beat a little faster") under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "tilted the stamp, examining its handle" compresses action/image. Minor deduction for "dappled resolve" bordering abstract phrasing, though immediately grounded by "wavering doubt." Zero loops or scaffold in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival obsession and physical discovery: the stamp transforms from cataloging tool to key through character-specific logic. Bold risk in making "reclaimed stillness" an active pressure point, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
