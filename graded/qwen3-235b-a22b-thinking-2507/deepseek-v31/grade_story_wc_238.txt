<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's embodied guilt ("thorn in her spirit") and Finch's weary forgiveness show contradictory impulses, but Finch's internal struggle lacks depth during the critical reconnection beat, slightly weakening earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds perfectly; Finch's orchard metaphor delivers Charged Poise closure with undeniable cost ("sweet and melancholic release" + saws' roar), though the single tightening could deepen stakes earlier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard roots constrain the final image ("feed new growth"), and perfume bottle's rosin memory charges the apology; "terminal bloom" and dust motes exemplify purpose-driven sensory specificity that shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via Finch's relived passion, but escalation lacks a visible cost to Elara during the reconnection—pressure accumulates texturally without narrowing her options under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "imperfect miracles" reframed by the lost nocturne's discovery; avoids moralizing via Finch's orchard metaphor, though "fractured your story" slightly edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sheet music archive during weighted silence") and rhythmic control under pressure; lyric compression taught early ("flickered, a photograph bleached by time") pays off in the final image's resonance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "terminal bloom" and "dust-laden silence" demonstrate high-density imagery. Minor register risk in "induced currents" is mitigated by musical context, and closure lines ("flawed, beautiful, and finally heard") achieve crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "exorcist" trope through gossip-column specificity; orchard/apology synthesis feels inevitable. Risk-taking (metaphor as method) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "imperfect miracles" concept borders on familiar.</comment>
