<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ash’s contradictory impulses (seeking truth vs. fearing his father’s fate) drive his embodied micro-choices, like closing the satchel "sharp and final." The earned renunciation—rejecting the circular path—stems from prior causality: handling the "meaningless money" after the old man’s revelation crystallizes cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Ash’s decision to leave "the circular path behind" reconfigures the dominant stake with felt cost (rejecting inherited identity). Orientation is anchored by line 3 ("abandoned circus train"), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through layered symbols and thematic density, though the startup backstory compresses causality slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The abandoned train functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its decaying "skeletal frames" and territorial markers directly charge the closure. Ash’s tactile interaction with symbols and satchel ("fingers over the grooves") embodies thematic pressure, making environment indispensable to the final image’s resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Ash’s agency-driven questions ("Why didn’t he?"), narrowing options as the old man’s exposition reveals the father’s failed escape. The cost—recognizing "polished calm" as a prison—is unmistakable in Ash’s final rejection, fulfilling escalation under the Accumulative lens with no reliance on coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally: the final image reweights "dusky harmony" from melancholy to liberation, avoiding moralizing. Ash’s realization ("lack the courage to cut a new path") arises from concrete particulars (satchel, symbols), with the conceptual repricing of his father’s "doomed equation" carrying undeniable social cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice modulates perfectly under pressure: Ash’s selective perception ("crisp yet empty" money) and rhythmic shifts (terse dialogue vs. lyrical description) reflect his state. The recurring "polished calm" motif risks cadence repetition but gains texture through Ash’s active rejection of its meaning.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances density. "Crisp yet empty of value" does double duty, and the final "sharp and final" clasp crystallizes closure. Minor deduction for "roadmap of wrinkles" (slight cliché), but no artifacts dull the peak beats or closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "cycle" trope through specific details: foreign currency as hollow "escape fund," territorial markers as path metaphors. Emotional truth in Ash’s quiet rejection feels fresh, with the startup backstory offering a non-obvious angle on inherited ruin. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over action) heightens stakes cohesively.</comment>
