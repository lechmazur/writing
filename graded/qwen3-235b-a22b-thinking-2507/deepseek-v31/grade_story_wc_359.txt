<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied through synesthetic perception ("colors bloomed into scent"), but lacks contradictory impulses during climax; motivation clear yet abstract "certify wonder" isn't tested by internal conflict. Final endurance earns cost through physical depletion ("drained but complete"), though moral ambiguity remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost (amber cleared, silence now "gold"), perfectly fulfilling Accumulative lens through sensory deepening. Orientation flawless by word 15 ("solitary tower"); catalyst ("sculptor’s chisel") slightly undermines protagonist agency but closure’s reconfiguration ("certify wonder as essential") lands with earned weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ice block functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice and charges final image (transforming to mist), while "sculpted hush" evolves from atmospheric detail to resonant pressure. Sensory specificity ("liquid-blue rays," "smelled of rain and ozone") avoids checklist tropes by filtering through synesthetic urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist-driven sensory deepening (muted bells → auroral pillar), but external catalyst ("sculptor’s chisel crack") weakens agency under Accumulative lens. Cost ("drained but complete") is felt yet insufficiently specific; dominant stake reweighted effectively by final image despite minor reliance on coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "prism-song" transformation, with final line ("silence now had a color, and it was gold") delivering Conceptual Repricing that reweights wonder as tangible. Zero thematic echo; complexity avoids binaries by framing wonder as both ephemeral ("dissolved") and essential ("seeding the world").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines via synesthetic diction ("auroral colors poured into the amber"), with rhythmic control intensifying during climax ("pillar of intricate, swirling light"). Slight clinical drift in "oscillating repose" momentarily distances voice, but compression remains taught and paid off through sensory accumulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fossilized song melt and flow like liquid gold" demonstrates high-density propulsion. Minor metaphor friction ("amber prison" clashes with organic "song") in one line, but no closure impact. Final image’s "gold" silence achieves textural precision without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Synesthesia + ice acoustics synthesizes tropes into fresh "prism-song" concept; risk-taking (lyric structure, no dialogue) heightens stakes coherently. Emotional specificity ("ennui... quiet desperation") avoids generic wonder tropes, with ice cavern’s transformation feeling inevitable through prior sensory groundwork.</comment>
