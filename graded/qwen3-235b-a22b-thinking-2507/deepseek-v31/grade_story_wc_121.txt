<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in gravity defiance vs emotional fall, embodied via "grief was a physical blow" and "shame was acid." Slight deduction for "periodically eternal" feeling conceptual rather than demonstrated tradeoffs in key beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable cost: "stepped off... finally allowing the fall" crystallizes options amid "infinite space." Orientation perfect within 50 words; Accumulative lens holds through memory accumulation tightening pressure toward acceptance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Glowing viaduct functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice (path generation) and charges the final image—"radiant road over abyss" directly fuels "darkening brightness" payoff. Meets 9+ gate by shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (conquest vs acceptance) tightens through memory confrontations that narrow options toward core fracture. Agency-driven escalation via path generation choices, with visible cost in "hollow man" state. "Procedural generation" phrasing slightly dilutes textural pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete particulars: "path of acceptance, not conquest" reweights premise via final action without moralizing. Final image ("whole self" in fall) delivers resonant non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("runes flowing like liquid mercury") with rhythmic control under pressure. Minor deduction as "periodically eternal" momentarily drifts into conceptual phrasing during high-stakes memory confrontation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "shame was acid" exemplifies high-density propulsion. "Procedural generation" is sole near-artifact—a semi-technical term in lyrical prose—but avoids muddling closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via specific synthesis: gravity defiance as emotional avoidance, procedural generation as memory navigation. Bold Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; "darkening brightness" recharges "drop/ripple" motif inevitably.</comment>
