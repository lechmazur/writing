<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through cartographer’s futile precision vs. emotional numbness; "useless habit" and dog-eared page reveal embodied struggle. Final renunciation of mapping earns closure but emotional depth slightly muted at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "epitaph" realization reframes discovery as witnessing extinction. Accumulative lens holds perfectly; condensation map’s erasure crystallizes the felt cost of vanishing knowledge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frozen lake setting constrains every choice—the ice enables the discovery, permafrost swallows truth. Micro-setting (condensation map on glass) directly charges the final image, meeting 9+ gate with visceral specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulative pressure: tranquility shifts from atmospheric to conceptual cost as the river’s subterranean truth emerges. Agency lies in Elara’s witnessing, but escalation lacks one tangible trade-off (e.g., physical risk on ice).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "worrying tranquility" evolves into the story’s devastating thesis. Final image ("end of the world") offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing—pure conceptual repricing of discovery as elegy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: cartographer’s "dry-witted" precision colors every observation ("freeze-dried water"). Minor deduction for "subtly confident woman" narrator intrusion disrupting POV modesty at climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "rusted-out postscript" exemplifies textural specificity. Slight overwriting in "persistent ghost" breath description, but propulsion remains flawless through crystalline rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms climate fiction tropes: river source as epitaph feels inevitable yet fresh. Bold risk in making discovery an endpoint, not hope, with specificity ("seven dialects for 'source'") elevating beyond generic elegy.</comment>
