<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's quiet obsession with "silent spaces" manifests in concrete micro-choices (gathering shards, climbing stairs), but the janitor's instantaneous awe feels unearned as secondary pressure, slightly undermining closure's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with conceptual cost ("cynical dust... wiped clean"), yet the crystal's sudden reality-fracturing power lacks causal setup—convenience threatens the Accumulative lens at the climax beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The chandelier constrains every choice: its shards enable testimony, its history pressures Elara's stance. Dawn's "suspended hush" evolves from atmosphere to charged motif, though spatial choreography of the staircase climb lacks tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through memory density as Elara shifts from decoder to witness, but the janitor's immediate conversion resolves the "world forgot to listen" conflict too cleanly—escalation needs grittier resistance to earn the conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the chandelier's archive: "meaning is never static" crystallizes without moralizing. The final image reweights "last dictionary" with "final chapter still being written," avoiding abstraction through concrete testimony.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct scholarly voice ("dust of a finished purpose") modulates beautifully under pressure, but "profound weathered innocence" slips into abstract label-speak during the climax, momentarily dulling embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose sings with textural density ("thousand teardrop crystals"), though "fractured sequences of memory and sound" repeats syntactic structure in adjacent lines, creating a minor propulsion loop that barely grazes the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "living language" trope through sonic archaeology: the chandelier's literal sound-capture makes growth visceral. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
