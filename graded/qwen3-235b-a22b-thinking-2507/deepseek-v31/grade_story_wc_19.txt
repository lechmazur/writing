<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Father's motivation lacks concrete grounding; Elara's claustrophobia is embodied through visceral details ("slowly collapsing lung," trapped scream), and her micro-choice to plant the doll earns her transformation with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: planting the doll creates irreversible change with palpable cost ("profound need awoke"), while the blue flower's emergence reconfigures silence's meaning under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The porcelain doll constrains choices (initial comfort object) and charges the final image (gift to trellis); bunker's canned air/generator hum grounds early claustrophobia that the trellis's "gilded hush" later transforms.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through gravity inversion's physical urgency; Elara's agency in releasing the doll forecloses her old survival doctrine with felt cost ("clutched in her hand" to "tucked into glowing vines").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through sensory evolution: silence shifts from "walls getting closer" to resonant chimes, with the doll-planting offering a non-literal answer to fear without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in weightlessness ("scream trapped in her throat," "movement slow in weightless air"); syntactic compression during inversion ("A wrench floated... Then he did") mirrors panic without scaffold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or muddle; "intangibly tangible" sensation avoids abstraction through concrete verbs ("chimed," "sprout"), while final line's "deep blue of twilight sky" pays off early porcelain imagery with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms claustrophobia trope via gravity inversion physics and "xenial trellis" specificity; risks poetic abstraction but anchors wonder in tactile choices (doll-planting), avoiding derivative fantasy.</comment>
