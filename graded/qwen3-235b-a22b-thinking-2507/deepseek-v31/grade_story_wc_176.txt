<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation crystallizes through physical act of casting; 'snowmelt ardor' embodies earned hope. Backstory fragment about technical arrogance slightly told, not shown through prior causality. Contradictory impulses (haste vs. precision) act in scene during wax transcription. Flaws compound organically without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: 'warm, rushing thaw of hope' reweights prior despair. Orientation clear by 45 words ('icebound sanctum under aurora'). Rope solution emerges from setting under Accumulative lens; no causality breaks. Cost proof evident in final image's emotional thaw.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ice geode and rope actively constrain choices—rope's reconfiguration enables the solution. Aurora's light becomes tactile tool, charging final image. Sensory hierarchy perfect: crisis narrows to wax/card textures. Micro-setting (wax block) charges closure as 'loose cradle of ancient fibers'.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving melody) tightens through material fragility: card crumbles, wax resists. Rope illumination creates decisive deepening under Accumulative lens. Cost legible in 'thaw of hope'—emotional price paid for endurance. Single meaningful intensification sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</comment><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from bronze card's physicality: 'fossil of a song' reweights memory. Final image ('names would be remembered') answers central question without moralizing. Complexity in 'regret' vs. 'duty' avoids false binaries. No thematic echo—resonance built through wax/bronze transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: caster's tactile focus ('touch as soft as a breath'). Rhythm modulates under pressure—short sentences during despair, flowing cadence at climax. Zero POV leakage; 'snowmelt ardor' lexicon stays character-bound. Elision of backstory taught early via 'unfixable mistake'.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; 'violet and gold' aurora flare propels climax. Strategic telling compresses backstory efficiently. 'Despair, an old acquaintance' slightly cliché but redeemed by immediate action. Final line's 'names would be remembered' resolves with textural specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lost wax casting transforms memory preservation trope through physical alchemy. Rope solution feels inevitable—braids as 'language' foreshadowed early. Emotional specificity in 'technical arrogance' avoids generic regret. Risk-taking (rope as lens) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
