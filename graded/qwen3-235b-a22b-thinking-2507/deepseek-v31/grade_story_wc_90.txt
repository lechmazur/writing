<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concretely embodied through gravitational weight shifts; pacifist core compellingly motivates grief immersion. Lacks contradictory impulses in peak beat—Steward’s actions remain singularly focused without visible internal friction beyond programmed purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: weight lifting with hope reconfigures stakes under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost ("felt that weight begin to lift") is legible on-page. Orientation solid by word 100; lens clarity strengthens through "stitch the tapestry" accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recycled spaceship setting constrains choices (tear built from "reclaimed hull plating"), with Arboretum mausoleum directly charging the climax. "Ivy-choked trees" and statue’s palm provide tactile specificity that alters the final action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through sorrow accumulation narrowing options to one final push. Cost is visible in physical weight loss, but escalation lacks protagonist agency shift—pressure grows via externalized grief collection rather than Steward’s altered tactics under duress.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through crystallized sorrows as tangible legacy, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("pushed with the weight of grief... felt weight lift") offers non-literal answer to "can loss become hope?" without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "quantum signature of tears" and gravitational metaphors. Rhythmic control peaks in climax ("pushed not with engines... but with entirety of its being"), compressing time without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "gravitational anchor" metaphor deepens without muddying. Minor overwriting ("faint shimmer of long-dried tears") risks density but pays off in tear’s payoff. Final line’s cadence perfectly recharges "ghost ship" motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pacifist AI and quantum grief avoids trope pitfalls. Risk-taking in non-human POV heightens stakes, but Kwan Yin statue edges toward symbolic convenience without deeper cultural integration.</comment>
