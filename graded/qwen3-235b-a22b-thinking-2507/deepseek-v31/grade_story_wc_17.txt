<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation to discover "what walls dream" is concretely embodied in her physical sensitivity to vibrations, driving her micro-choices (pressing ear to wall, sifting diaries). Interior contradiction—academic pursuit vs. compelled testimony—peaks in the scream revelation, with "curse" of perception making the cost visceral. No secondary character limits relationship depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: "The burden... would now be shared" crystallizes stance with felt cost (her choice to carry collective memory). Accumulative lens holds from "murmurs trapped within" to scream; cost proof evident in "awful weight of the past." Orientation clear by 80 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage functions as micro-setting that pressures choices (moving "deeper" due to clinging shadows) and charges closure via "dust of the corridor." Fireplace debris and negative constrain action (sifting charred pages, holding film to light), with "damp earth" scent evolving into remembered anguish.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (observer vs. witness) tightens via negative discovery: her agency in pressing ear to wall escalates to scream revelation, narrowing options. Cost is legible in "curse" of perception and "awful weight," with burden shift to collective memory reweighting stakes under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: industrial complex frames vs. burning diaries, "walls dreaming" of betrayal. Final image ("burden shared") offers resonant answer without moralizing. Avoids false equivalence by condemning complicity while honoring daughter’s futile act.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "listener of stone," "sift through half-burned diaries" reflect profession-specific noticing. Rhythm modulates under pressure—short sentences for negative discovery, flowing prose for scream—without head-hopping. "Shadows clung thickest" exemplifies biased, tactile observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("heavy mantle of complicit knowledge" replaces abstraction). Figurative language serves pressure: "hungry forest" and "scream" escalate without muddle. Minor overwriting in "remembered anguish" (could be "memory’s weight") barely touches peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms climate grief via echo cartographer conceit: "walls dreaming" literalized through vibration sensitivity. Film negative avoids cliché by being physically handled (brittle, held to light). Risk-taking (scream as climax) heightens stakes through prior sensory groundwork.</comment>
