<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo’s contradictory impulses (professional observer vs ghost-avoider) crystallize in his final choice to engage, with embodied cost in "voice rough in the silence." Ghost girl’s motivation as unwitnessed heroism avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust patterns deepen into closure as girl dissolves into motes. Vision transition ("world shifted") slightly convenient but Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost in "weightless burden being lifted."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dust motes function as micro-setting, evolving from "lazy confetti" to charge the final image of dissolution. Tarnished brass barrel’s transformation directly constrains Leo’s climactic choice and final grasp.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Leo’s analysis of dust patterns, culminating in his agency-driven choice to engage. Cost is visceral in the ghost’s "profound relief" and his rough voice—no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of unwitnessed courage emerges through scuffed shoe and ledger ghost, resolving in the final image where dust motes reweight the barrel as "cool, solid truth" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "dust accumulation patterns as timeline" filters all observation. Rhythm shifts from lyrical ("dust motes drifted like lazy confetti") to staccato under pressure ("Climbing up, he pressed").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "tarnished brass" → "cool, solid truth" shows patterned reprise. Final line’s concrete specificity ("proof of courage pre-dating his life") avoids abstraction while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ghosts as "unresolved acts" not trauma, with technician’s skills making sightings plausible. Mainspring barrel as proof of heroism transforms trope through specific, grounded mechanics.</comment>
