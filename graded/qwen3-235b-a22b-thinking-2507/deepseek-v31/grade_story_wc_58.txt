<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied details ("tension left her shoulders") and contradictory impulses (grief vs. gratitude), but Elias' personal stakes in healing remain abstract without micro-choices showing his struggle beyond observation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with the Countess' smile and "explained absence... suddenly felt lighter," but the rain's arrival slightly undermines pressure escalation by coincidentally marking the emotional shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The garden's "lonesome splendor" directly constrains choice (Elias sits on stone bench, leaf drifts between them) and charges the final image where rain "spotting the dark stone" mirrors emotional release, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen meaningfully when the carpet thread metaphor transforms abstract healing into tangible cost ("without it... unravel"), but pressure lacks active resistance—Elias merely receives wisdom rather than driving escalation through agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the thread motif recharged in the final image ("learned to see it too"), avoiding moralizing; Countess' "healing is a thread" risks thematic echo but stays character-rooted in context.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("crunch like old bones," "rustle of that very leaf") and rhythmic control under pressure; elision of Elias' backstory taught early via "traveler who would travel no more" pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Minor redundancy ("melancholy perfume of decay, a vividly descriptive aroma") triggers -0.3 loop penalty; otherwise impeccable density with "crisp and curled" leaves advancing both atmosphere and emotional state.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of obituaries for the living with carpet metaphor feels inevitable, but risks remain safe—no bold structural choices heighten stakes beyond the established lyric frame.</comment>
