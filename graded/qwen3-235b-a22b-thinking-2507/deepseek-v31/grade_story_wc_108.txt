<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority shines with "trembling with certainty" and vulnerability-as-power motivation, but ocean phobia lacks embodied contradiction during climax ("throat tightened" is generic label). Final choice lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses, failing 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong Earned Stasis closure with visible cost ("gasping and weeping, clutched the case as anchor"), but Orientation Test fails: "coastal bluff" remains vague past 120 words, triggering -0.4 penalty that would cap Q3 at 7.0 if not for micro-setting allowance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Capped per Q2 orientation penalty; "rusted library" setting lacks geographic specificity. Micro-setting rescue: seashell constrains decryption (scraping glitter) and charges final image (reweighted whisper), barely meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation under Causal lens is masterful: phobia transforms from weakness to tool, with gut-churning dread→sob-breath→weeping ascent showing unmistakable cost. One tightening suffices for length, driven purely by Leo's agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through action: "vulnerability is power" proven when phobia becomes key to outwitting director. Final image reweights seashell's whisper as "truth," delivering perfect Conceptual Repricing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("stunt-coordination math to nautical charts"), but "潮汐-like whisper" (Chinese characters) violates Leo's POV lexicon. Register drift in peak beat triggers -0.3, capped by orientation debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose sings in dive sequence ("black water a void," "feeble beam through murk"), but Chinese characters in "潮汐-like whisper" create clarity break. Minor paraphrase loop ("trembling with certainty") avoids closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms stunt-double trope via phobia-as-weapon angle; "vulnerability is power" avoids cliché by making fear the literal key. "Rusted library" feels derivative, but seashell's dual role (tool/symbol) elevates originality.</comment>
