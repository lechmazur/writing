<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in climax ("fragile, lie built on secret" vs "mend it"), but "senselessly perceptive" trait remains labeled rather than embodied in action under pressure, slightly undercutting micro-choice authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("tranquil blaze felt suddenly fragile") under Accumulative lens; orientation anchors by 80 words, density escalation reweights stakes through sensory accumulation without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass dome and desert roses function as micro-setting that constrains choice (ritual at plant bases) and charges final image ("grow a new kind of peace"), transforming environment into active pressure point rather than backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency through sensory density ("engraved quiet" to discovery tremor), with cost legible in shattered peace ("fragile, lie built on secret"); single tightening crystallizes stance under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (sandbag ritual → "plant this truth"), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "weave continuity through chaos" as active growth, not passive hiding, with conceptual cost made undeniable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("engraved quiet," "tranquil blaze") modulates rhythm under pressure; patterned diction ("sheathe") taught early pays off in closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion ("her heart hammered... against serenity"); final line recharges "tranquil blaze" with conceptual cost, no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "bounty hunter legacy" trope through desert rose ritual and Accumulative structure; "sheathe daughter in oasis" inflection feels inevitable yet fresh, risk-taking heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
