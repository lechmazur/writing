<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses (fear/speaking up) manifest in embodied micro-choices; the whispered story admission reveals hierarchy of values with tangible cost. No therapy-speak—apprehension "softening" shows organic change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands decisively: "courage is not a place... but a choice you carry" reweights the entire premise with felt cost in the star's pulse. Accumulative lens holds through the vigil's deepening pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The brass ticket punch constrains choice (toll payment) and charges the final image—Elara touching the star as "validation." Mist-river setting evolves causally from obstacle to passage, mirroring internal shift without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: Elara's whispered story (meaningful trade-off) narrows options by exchanging vulnerability for passage. Cost is visible in the "heart sank" moment, though pressure intensification lacks one more tightening beat pre-crossing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the star stamp reweights "unused courage" into active choice without moralizing. Final image ("carrying it with her... put to use") offers resonant non-literal answer to the central question, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ashen path," "saline hint of sea") filters urgency; rhythm modulates from misty languor to "silent melody" cadence under pressure. No head-hopping—focalization stays locked in Elara's sensory experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "worn, brass ticket punch" exemplifies textural specificity over abstraction. Final line's "silent melody... new lullaby" achieves high-density propulsion without figurative muddle, deepening closure through concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms journey trope via tactile details (gravel-voiced guides, star's "inner light") and bold structural choice: courage as receipt rather than destination. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates through the ticket punch's irreplaceable symbolism.</comment>
