<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motive ("press your ear against destiny’s door") drives her risk-taking without abstraction; her "luminous disbelief" finale embodies contradictory awe and unworthiness. Flaw: "genius hidden in plain sight" tells rather than shows her savvy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: her jar-clutching stance crystallizes cost (physical danger, painting’s soul lost) under Situational lens. Constable’s interruption forces irreversible leap, tightening options meaningfully without coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maintenance gantry—a micro-setting—constrains her escape choice and charges the final image; moonlight transforms Emerald Station from "bustling hive" to monochrome escape route. Every detail (dragon-scale roof, buttery glow) filters through Elara’s urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stealing the moment before sunset) tightens via constable’s arrival, forcing the window leap. Cost is visceral: heart-in-throat drop and "jarring thud" on the gantry. Agency remains hers; luck (gantry proximity) complicates but doesn’t resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of ephemeral beauty emerges through the jar’s "pulsing warmth" reweighting "destiny’s song" without moralizing. Final image—holding stolen moments while the painting dulls—answers the central question through action, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "buttery, dying glow" and "spiderweb of iron" reflect Elara’s artist-thief lens. Rhythmic control under stress ("Think, she commanded herself, think like the light") avoids syntactic monotony. Zero POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Luminous disbelief" borders on abstraction but is redeemed by "jar clutched tight" physicality. Minor overwriting ("buttery, dying glow") in one beat; no loops or scaffold. Final line’s "heard its song" propels closure with zero drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Thief-of-moments premise transforms heist tropes through specific mechanics (flower codes, moonbeam jar). Risk-taking (window leap) heightens stakes coherently; the jar’s "illuminated moments" synthesis feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
