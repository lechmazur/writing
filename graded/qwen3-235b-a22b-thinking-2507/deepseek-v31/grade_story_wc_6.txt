<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation ("to prove scars can sing") drives every action, but internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses under pressure; the "unyielding compassion" concept isn't tested through active struggle, missing the 9+ requirement for earned tension in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as Elara understands the scar's song "is not in the object itself," with visceral cost ("vibrated through the bones of her hand"); the Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly through density buildup to this crystallized moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting (obsidian lagoon, black sand) constrains choices: volcanic sand anchors the graft, obsidian shards become tools, directly charging the final image where "a fleck of black volcanic sand" secures her legacy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes ("to prove scars can sing") deepen through the grafting process, but escalation relies on revelation rather than protagonist-driven pressure; the hum's conceptual cost reweights meaning, yet agency in tightening options remains passive during the pivotal sound revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: grafting "cool, unforgiving glass to warm, forgiving wood" embodies "unyielding compassion," culminating in the resonant hum that reweights scars as song without moralizing, fulfilling the 9+ quick test flawlessly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("kelp-drift peace," "memory of fire") shines, but rhythmic control falters under peak stress; the grafting scene maintains uniform lyrical density without compression, missing the 9+ requirement for pressure-responsive modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but abstract noun stacking ("song of stress and fracture and healing") muddles the pivotal hum description; minor figurative risk prevents 9+ despite otherwise impeccable propulsion and specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes arsonist/firefighter paradox through the grafting alchemy, transforming "scars can sing" into tangible craft; risk-taking (lyric structure, conceptual closure) heightens stakes coherently without gimmickry, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
