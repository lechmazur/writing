<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in profession (vial ritual) shows contradictory impulses: seeking answers yet embracing the inexplicable. Final choice to release compass earns cost through prior psychometry sequence, though Althea’s backstory edges toward summary rather than embodied choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost ("become part of the question"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds through bioluminescent lagoon imagery to final breath. Minor lens ambiguity in compass motivation prevents 9.0+ despite resonant cost in "wordless kinship" line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Subterranean lagoon constrains every choice: its stillness enables the vision, cold water forces physical commitment, abyssal depth charges the final plunge. Bioluminescent fungi and "plink-plink" droplets reconfigure stakes without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("failure of explanation") tightens through Silas’s wading and plunge, narrowing options from collection to surrender. Agency-driven deepening in psychometry sequence reweights knowledge, but rockslide backstory reduces tension via coincidence rather than earned pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: petrichor (renewal scent) vs. lagoon (trial scent) reweights "surrender" without moralizing. Final image of breathing "part of the hush" offers resonant answer to "where explanations fail," avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sensibly eccentric" collector notices rain-scents, compass spins). Rhythmic control shifts from industrial cacophony to lagoon stillness, though psychometry vision’s "hinged awakenings" risks abstractness under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density; "obsidian surface" and "silencing of every nerve" propel action. Minor overwriting in "hinged awakenings" sequence (abstract metaphor in high-pressure beat) prevents 9.0+, but final plunge’s sensory clarity salvages momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis: petrichor collector hunting "explanations fail" transforms cliché into visceral truth. Risk-taking (psychometry in literary fiction) heightens stakes through concrete lagoon physics, with emotional specificity avoiding generic transcendence.</comment>
