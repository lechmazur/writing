<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in peak pressure; Aelia’s pure altruism avoids internal struggle, weakening micro-choices. Settlers’ shift to understanding feels abrupt without layered doubt. Motivation is clear but uncomplicated by flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: nebula revelation reconfigures their role with felt cost in "brambled hope now flowering." Accumulative lens holds—density of failed efforts deepens despair until crystallizing moment. Zero orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floating rose-quartz arches constrain tactics (pruning locations); watering bell’s micro-setting drives communication. Final nebula image charges closure with "velvety cobalt" specificity. Environment actively shapes choices, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation via accumulative density: each failed message narrows options, deepening despair until the map forces reexamination. Cost is visceral in fraying faith and brambled hope. Agency lies in settlers’ collective obedience then understanding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through "partners in celestial dance" realization, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "brambled hope" motif with conceptual cost—shifting from servants to partners. No thematic echo; ambiguity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "particulate silence," "tapestry of cultivated life" reflect Aelia’s ethereal POV. Rhythm modulates from cool precision to "velvety cobalt" awe. Zero head-hopping; compression taught early via bell mechanics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dew collected on its specific, flower-like shape" shows trustworthiness without telling. High density: "brambled with thorns of doubt" ties emotion to orchard. Final line’s recharged motif avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope via watering bell’s constraints; "orchard planet" avoids generic SF. Synthesis feels inevitable—celestial dance reframes blight as severed connection. Risk-taking (silent protagonist) heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
