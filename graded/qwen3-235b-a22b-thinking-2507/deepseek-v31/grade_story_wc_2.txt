<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("uncertainly certain") and embodied struggle (numb fingers, shockingly cold water) deepen motivation, though "deep, unsettling doubt" edges toward abstraction without sufficient physical manifestation in pivotal repair beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully with undeniable conceptual cost ("not fixed time; found her place"), but the transition to the greenhouse relies slightly on convenient motivation ("driven by unfamiliar motivation") rather than causal pressure from the compass's persistent defiance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The compass constrains choices (pointing southeast), the subterranean waterfall charges the final image (phosphorescent pool, mist), and the cold water directly alters Lira's tactics during repair, fulfilling micro-setting requirements for 9+ band eligibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation via sensory accumulation (tarnished disc → silent storm → roaring waterfall) deepens the dominant stake (rigidity vs. uncertainty) under the Accumulative lens, though the greenhouse discovery lacks a visible price paid *before* the cavern reveal to tighten options earlier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The final line ("beautiful, uncertain flow") resonates as a non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting the compass and clock through earned experience, avoiding moralizing while embracing thematic complexity about time's nature.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("measured ticks," "silent rebuke") and rhythmic control during the repair sequence shine, though "eyes like cracked porcelain" slightly dilutes the otherwise immaculate voice with a familiar trope.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion prevail ("wading through shockingly cold water"), but "wet earth and decay" and "silent storm" verge on sensory checklist repetition without unique POV filtration in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms the clockmaker trope through specific, non-obvious synthesis (clock measuring "timing"), with bold risk-taking in the CR closure that heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
