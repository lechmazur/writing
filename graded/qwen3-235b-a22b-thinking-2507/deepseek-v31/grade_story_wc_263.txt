<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but lacks contradictory impulses in key moments; motivation clear yet "trapped songbird" archetype borders on stock phrasing without deeper flaw manifestation under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost ("fragile beauty"), but melancholy feels told rather than embodied; Accumulative lens holds though cost legibility falters at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Nocturlabe as micro-setting constrains choice (assembly in aurora) and charges final image; sensory specificity in "warm rain" of light transforms environment into active pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freeing creativity) tightens through aurora progression, but escalation lacks visible cost beyond abstract melancholy; agency passive in pivotal star-tracing sequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through color rebirth imagery, but "fragile beauty" risks thematic echo; avoids moralizing though final insight leans toward tell in closure beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("unspoken words") modulates under stress; rhythmic control in aurora climax elevates pressure without sacrificing clarity or POV integrity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor synonym loops ("monochrome surface"/"monochrome ground") in high-pressure beats; otherwise high density with zero figurative muddle in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of nocturlabe navigation, but "creativity vs gray world" trope lacks transformative specificity; emotional truth in "shadowed rapture" compensates for familiar framework.</comment>
