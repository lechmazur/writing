<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (whimsy vs. urgency) drive micro-choices; final scattering of mandala earns closure with visible cost in "lilac unease lifted... because questions had been heard." Philosopher interaction crystallizes stance without resolution via dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "lilac unease lifted... because questions had finally been heard" reconfigures meaning under Accumulative lens. Orientation clear by word 30; no lens ambiguity. Cost proof airtight in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grotto walls and tile flake function as micro-setting that constrains choices (pressing ceramic to stone) and charges final image ("sand mix with mist"). Sensory details filtered through artist POV—stained fingers, lilac mist—avoid white-room syndrome while driving closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via Accumulative pressure: emergent hush tightens into sonic tapestry, forcing Elara's stance crystallization. Cost legible in lifted unease, but emotional weight slightly abstract. Philosopher's interruption tests commitment without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: mandala scattering and sonic tapestry offer resonant answer to "meaning in chaos" without moralizing. Final whisper reweights "lilac unease" into hope, avoiding Thematic Echo despite philosopher's dialogue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (artist noticing color/texture/sound) with rhythmic control: short sentences during tension ("Listen," she whispered"), lyrical flow in discovery. Deep POV maintained; philosopher's dialogue carries subtext without voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density (e.g., "fingers stained rainbow" conveys occupation/state). Near-deduction for "whimsical heart finally peaceful" bordering abstraction, but offset by concrete actions. Final line avoids cliché with purposeful reprise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "artist finds meaning" trope through sonic tapestry resolution. Fresh inflection: meaning as emergent harmony of fragments, not single answer. Emotional specificity in "questions heard" avoids generic templates; risk-taking heightens stakes without obscurity.</comment>
