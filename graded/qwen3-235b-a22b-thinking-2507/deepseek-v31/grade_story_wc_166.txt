<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("secret she scarcely acknowledged") manifests in embodied micro-choices: each needle prick "anchor and release" crystallizes her exile-as-rebellion. Final renunciation of sterile world earned through physical cost ("body thrumming with exertion"), though "spontaneously anchored" borders on label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: "she was a constellation" reconfigures exile into vantage point with tangible cost ("obsidian grace deepened, becoming tangible"). Accumulative lens holds—density peaks at moonstone application—though "fledge" concept lacks sufficient groundwork pre-climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: tattoo needle ("point catching starlight") constrains action ("hands did not tremble") and charges closure ("design gleam with soft internal light"). Twilight garden’s star-fed blooms actively enable forbidden art, avoiding postcard description through causal pressure on pigment preparation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming erased past) tightens through moonstone’s final application, shifting from creation to transformation ("profound shift"). Cost is visceral ("body thrumming"), but government pressure remains off-page; escalation succeeds via accumulative lens yet lacks concrete antagonist complication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "map of absence" etched into skin reweights nostalgia ban’s "smooth plain" into living resistance. Final image ("stars... looking back") offers non-literal answer without moralizing, though "cosmic verse on mortal skin" edges toward thematic echo in early exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "liquid silence where every movement felt weighted" filters setting through tide-dancer’s embodied expertise. Rhythmic control under pressure ("Each puncture was a step in forgotten dance") avoids lyric overindulgence; moonstone’s "essence of reflection" modulates voice with purpose.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding: "starlight catching microscopic crystal" compresses physics, emotion, and theme into one propulsive image. Only minor deduction for "obsidian grace" repetition (3x), but accumulative lens justifies motif reinforcement; no figurative muddle even in high-pressure tattooing beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms exile trope through specific synthesis: tide-dancer’s "language of tides" becomes skin-bound cartography of erased constellations. Risk-taking (cosmic tattoo as resistance) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "fledging not away from, but *into*" delivers fresh inflection that feels inevitable.</comment>
