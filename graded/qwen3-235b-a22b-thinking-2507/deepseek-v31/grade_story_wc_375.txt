<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (duty vs creativity) is concrete but lacks active struggle pre-climax; tearing the canvas feels abrupt without prior micro-choices showing suppressed urge. Motivation clear but final choice lacks layered buildup under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (wasted years as necessary contrast), but lock-breaking relies on coincidence, not protagonist agency. Accumulative lens holds yet escalation lacks meaningful tightening before cave discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cave’s glittering walls charge the final image powerfully, yet remain passive backdrop—no spatial constraints alter tactics. "Charcoal-stained fingers" as micro-setting elevates final beat but earlier tools lack causal weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (suppressed creativity) signaled early, but escalation depends on external inciting incident (old woman) rather than protagonist-driven pressure. Key cost (wasted years) is felt but not earned through active struggle until final moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: "sorrow of a dawn that recognizes the night" reweights memory’s curse as creative fuel without moralizing. Final image (fingers stained with color) resonates as earned answer to "replicate vs create" question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("auroral sorrow," "ten thousand faces" refracted into light); rhythm shifts from grayscale cadence to prismatic bursts. Zero head-hopping, compression taught early via charcoal motif, voice modulates perfectly under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion but "auroral sorrow" phrasing repeats identically in paras 2/5/7 (minor synonym churn). Figurative language ("internal dawn") enhances climax without muddling; final line’s "stained not with charcoal, but with color" achieves crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "artist’s block" trope via specific mechanics (mnemonic curse as tool, not masterpiece). Emotional specificity ("sorrow of a dawn") avoids cliché, though keyhole-behind-painting risks slight trope echo without deeper integration.</comment>
