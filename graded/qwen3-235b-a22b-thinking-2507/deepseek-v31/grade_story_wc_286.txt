<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses (investigator vs. legacy-keeper) act simultaneously; her final choice to infuse pottery with intention earns closure through weeks of demonstrated causality ("small offerings"), with visible cost in taking on the oasis’s maintenance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Elara’s pottery emitting "a new, softer thrum" crystallizes options (observer→participant) with undeniable conceptual cost (eternal stewardship), under a consistent Accumulative/Textural lens where sun-patterned vision density drives escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lantern glass as micro-setting constrains every key choice (timing acts by sun angles) and charges the final image (glowing pots continuing the thrum); sensory details like "clay thrummed with memory" reflect potter’s embodied priorities without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara’s agency: initial curiosity ("to understand resistance") tightens to the beekeeper’s final offering, with cost crystallized in her transformation from uncoverer to legacy-bearer—no coincidence, pure accumulated pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of "sharp gentleness" emerges solely through concrete actions (mending walls, leaving water), avoiding moralizing; the final pots glowing as "a prayer for steadfastness" reweights the premise non-literally, rejecting tidy binaries for active resistance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("steps a quiet hymn," "thrummed with memory"), with rhythmic control modulating from lyrical pottery focus to fractured vision shards; compression taught early ("world flickered... shattered") pays off in closure’s resonant simplicity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "chimney smoke flattened against heavy sky" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Figurative language ("oasis’s only heartbeat") serves character-specific texture without muddle, culminating in the closure line’s flawless cadence: "a new, softer thrum joined the silence... a promise, continuing."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Phototropic to kindness" transforms eco-fiction tropes through precise mechanics (sun-patterned visions, bone-deep thrum); the synthesis of pottery and timeline legacy feels inevitable yet fresh, with risk-taking (lyric structure) heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
