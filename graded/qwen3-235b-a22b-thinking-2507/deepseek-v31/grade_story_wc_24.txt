<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete ("unease settling in her bones"), micro-choices under pressure (suppressing panic to count), but epiphany edges toward unearned wisdom without sufficient struggle visible in the counting sequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost ("inevitable, beautiful decay") under Accumulative/Textural lens; the counting sequence creates a cadence shift that reweights the premise while maintaining causal coherence through mechanical necessity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The hydraulic clock system functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (counting primes replaces key) and charges the final image; sensory details like "teeth gleaming like sharpened silver discs" reflect professional bias without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through density increase (anomaly → missing key → counting protocol) under Accumulative lens; conceptual cost of accepting decay is legible but lacks visceral physical trade-off during the counting sequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the counting ritual's transformation of "razor edges" into metaphor for decay; final image reweights clocks as measuring process without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite the explicit insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("razor edges," "fluid rhythm") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control during counting sequence ("Nine hundred seventy-three...") embodies machine logic, though "deep unease settling in her bones" slightly drifts from character-specific lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops and high density ("catastrophic" for key's absence), but "deep unease settling in her bones" is a borderline bodily cliché; final line's propulsion ("count it backwards") overcomes minor figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of clock mechanics as existential metaphor feels inevitable; "counting backwards" method transforms trope through concrete causality, though fjord setting leans slightly generic despite effective integration.</comment>
