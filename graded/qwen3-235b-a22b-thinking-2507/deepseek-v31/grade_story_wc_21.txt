<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation intensifies credibly from archival duty to rescue mission, but the shift lacks embodied contradiction; "wild, illogical thought" feels abrupt without wrestling with skepticism before acting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "I WILL REMEMBER" crystallizes options with conceptual cost as lagoon fades, holding causal lens through diary decryption and parley mechanics without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon constrains every choice—from vision trigger to communication medium—and charges the final image; volcanic glass properties directly enable the closure's conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency: cipher struggle → vision → debris method deepens stakes meaningfully, but Kenneth's immediate cooperative response lacks resistance, slightly softening the pressure curve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "truth carried in the solemn heart" reweights "suspended time" without moralizing, making oppression's cost undeniable through the lagoon's sentient silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in archival details ("tracing indentations," "ghost of urgency"), but micro-tics like "sigh of the wind" verge on cliché during high-pressure vision sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is largely propulsion-perfect, but "silence was profound, broken only by..." followed by wind scattering letters creates subtle paraphrase loop in critical vision beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ingenuity in sentient landscape as archival medium transforms trope; retrocognition feels earned through diary's physicality, avoiding abstraction while heightening stakes through volcanic specificity.</comment>
