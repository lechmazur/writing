<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("feral" yet "conversant with quiet") and embodied homesickness ("bone-ache") drive choices; micro-choice to mend rift using garden's "latent truth" earns endurance with visible cost. Slight tell in "make friends with uncertainty" phrasing barely mars otherwise concrete progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands flawlessly under Accumulative lens: mending rift forecloses escape with felt cost ("homesickness... layered with satisfaction"). Pressure builds through perception shifts (mist coiling, light boundaries) culminating in pendant's death; cost proof evident in "dull throb" enduring alongside new satisfaction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frozen garden constrains every choice—it's the text Elara "reads," its "latent truth" mending the rift. Final image of "companionable quiet" recharges the opening "void," making environment indispensable to closure. Sensory specificity ("crystalline hedges," "cold bench") avoids cliché through POV-filtered urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize immediately: guard rift vs. sate homesickness. Escalation via pendant's "warning heartbeat" forces agency—Elara's choice to mend using the garden's "interior truth" narrows options with cost (enduring longing). Pressure tightens under Accumulative lens through perceptual deepening, not external action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "interiorizing exteriors" isn't stated but enacted as mending the rift. Final silence reweighted from "empty void" to "companionable quiet" offers non-literal resolution to homesickness without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers in "uncertainty... a promise," avoiding false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bone-ache of homesickness," time as "syrup") modulates with pressure—lyrical cadence shifts to urgent fragments at rift's appearance ("She did not attack... she simply waited"). Zero POV slippage; syntax mirrors mental state (longer sentences for contemplation, staccato for crisis).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("boundaries of light became starkly visible, not as gradients but as razor-thin lines") propels momentum. Figurative language ("yearning for the rustle of pages") serves character-specific perception without muddle. Final line crystallizes theme through concrete action: "conversant with the quiet and the fog."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms guardian trope through "dimensionally homesick" librarian; emotional truth in choosing mystery over home feels fresh. "Interiorizing exteriors" as method synthesizes setting/theme organically. Avoids safety-middle via bold quiet resolution—mending rift through perception, not battle—heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
