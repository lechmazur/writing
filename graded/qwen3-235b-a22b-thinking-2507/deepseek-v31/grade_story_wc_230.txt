<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: "rational truffle forager" vs "desperate woman" crystallizes in the pivotal "beautiful trap" confession. Embodied emotion flawless—teeth vibrating with shared anguish, cool glass against temple—avoiding diagnostic labels. Micro-choice (temple placement) reveals value hierarchy with cost. Slight deduction for minimal physicality during storm climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "narrow ledge, but it was a start" crystallizes stance with visible cost. Accumulative lens holds—sensory density escalates to the glass eye’s memory intrusion, reweighting stakes. Orientation anchored by 50 words. Minor deduction: "truth spilled from lips" slightly over-explains after showing involuntary truthfulness earlier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ravine micro-setting constrains choice: storm forces decision, wind-sculpted trees enable the glass eye’s discovery. Final "trowel" image charges the setting’s meaning. "Fractured grace" recurrence earns full credit. Deduction for "teeth vibrate" sensation not revisited during climax, missing full sensory closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency under Accumulative lens: sensory pressure builds to the glass eye’s false solution, tightening options via "beautiful trap" realization. Dominant stake (true safety vs stolen peace) foreclosed with cost ("narrow ledge"). Storm’s "symphony of shared suffering" makes cost undeniable. Flawless for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "trowel... building a home" answers "cultivate psychological safety" without moralizing. Avoids false balance by showing why stolen solace is morally compromised. Deduction for slight modern jargon ("psychological safety") though context mitigates. Final image reweights premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "rational truffle forager" notices "fractured grace" of storm-battered trees. Syntax mirrors mental state—long observation sentences fracturing into staccato crisis beats. Deduction for "symphony of shared suffering" feeling detached from POV in climax. Zero head-hopping; elision taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "gale-torn branches swept... in beautiful, desperate arcs" shows textural density. Deductions for "palpable and dense" (thesaurus-itis) and forced neologism "mono-din." Final "trowel" image avoids figurative muddle. Prose propulsion flawless—rhythm accelerates with storm, breathes during revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms empathy tropes via specific details: truffle forager motivation, glass eye as smuggled relic. "Trowel" metaphor provides fresh inflection on "cultivate." Emotional truth in choosing hard work over easy cure. Deduction: "empathy virus" premise lacks radical novelty despite exceptional execution.</comment>
