<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; final choice feels inevitable rather than earned through prior causality. "Tranquil blaze" concept remains abstract without embodied struggle or visible flaw-complication during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: "silent supernova of will" preceding the yielding sigh reconfigures the prophecy's threat through palpable expenditure of tranquility under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The brook’s flow functions as active micro-setting, constraining Aeliana’s breathing rhythm and tactics; its cessation directly charges the final image of "saved quiet," satisfying 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation via density increase—knot unraveling strand by strand—driven solely by protagonist agency; cost crystallizes in "poured every ounce of cultivated tranquility," unmistakable in the supernova metaphor before resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "mapping silence onto sound" reweights quiet as active resistance. Final image ("harmless, forgotten dream") offers resonant answer without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "glowing knot of angry light" and "soft blue dye" metaphors; rhythmic control shifts from measured cadence to compressed urgency ("millimeters and microseconds") under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, though "whispered secrets traded between rustling leaves" slightly overwrites. Final line’s crystalline simplicity ("profound and saved quiet") avoids closure muddling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms summoner trope through quiet-focused magic; "mapping silence" synthesizes specificity (origami wing’s incomplete potential) with emotional truth of solitary effort, avoiding generic apocalypse conventions.</comment>
