<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-choices like hedgehog timing reveal embodied motivation; final strum earns closure through prior causality. Slight abstraction in "profound empathy" moments prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise ("silent world was silent no more") with visceral cost ("tears streamed down her face"). Wind coincidence complicates but doesn't resolve, fitting Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Alder grove and porcelain insulator constrain choices (shaving slivers, filament tension) and charge closure's vibration. Missing one layer of wood-specific texture prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation via crack analysis forecloses rigid approach with emotional cost. Wind's role as complicating coincidence slightly muddies agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "fingers reading fissures like a map," not statement. Final chord reweights silence without moralizing, though "proof of her empathy" borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "vibration traveled from soles to crown," but "profoundly quiet patience" slips toward abstraction under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; "humble beginning" phrase achieves high density. Minor abstraction in "symphonically minded design" prevents 9.5+ despite flawless climax rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Heartstring fibers" transforms trope into organic necessity; empathy as technical skill ("forensic empathy") synthesizes fresh angle on creation myth.</comment>
