<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority with embodied emotion ("stomach lurched," "fingers trembling") and earned final choice to implant the seed. Minor lack of interior contradiction weakens high-band entry; motivation clear but prism-mind trait slightly underexploited in crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "she would not hide them... plant the first seed" crystallizes stance with visible cost ("responsibility," "world sleeping/she awake"). Causal lens holds throughout; gravity inversion as catalyst drives all pivotal turns without loopholes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grotto setting constrains every choice (inverted navigation, time pressure) and charges final image ("glowed with clandestine light" in pouch). Light-tube and chronometer function as micro-settings that directly enable glyph discovery and urgency. Sensory details vivid but could deepen tactile weightlessness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding seeds to combat "sleep for all minds") tightens when activation reveals bearer requirement, forcing her pivotal choice. Cost is unmistakable: "responsibility" and eternal vigilance. Agency drives all escalation; inversion catalyst narrows options without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: final image ("carrying luminous future within her") reweights "latent blaze" motif into earned vigilance-as-burden. Zero moralizing; "world sleeping/she awake" resonates without abstraction. Conceptual cost (eternal watch) legible in closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("prism-mind flared with synesthetic color," "spectral truths") modulates perfectly under pressure. Rhythmic control shifts from tense brevity ("She reached out") to flowing revelation. No POV slippage; lexicon stays character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ancient stone teeth hung" exemplifies high-density prose. Figurative language purposeful ("clandestinely luminous" reprises meaningfully). Minor "eager pupils" metaphor slight friction but doesn't obscure closure. Final line charges motif flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: gravity inversion as cipher-key transforms "chosen one" trope. Emotional truth in quiet resolve ("steps firm on solid ground") avoids cliché. "Clandestinely luminous" and prism-mind details feel inevitable, not quirky. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
