<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (duty vs. preservation) act simultaneously in the envelope scene; the synthesis solution is earned by prior causality with visible cost (tear of relief). Slight tell in "motivation, sharp and clear" weakens embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change with undeniable cost: "tear of relief track through the grime" crystallizes emotional toll. Mountain’s breathing provides causal escalation, though Council acquiescence risks convenience without Kael’s prior encrypted aid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Surveyor’s chain constrains the pivotal choice (measuring chamber for bypass) and charges the final image (gears implementing chain-derived design). Volcano’s breathing is tactilely integrated, avoiding abstract symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes viscerally tighten via the mountain’s breath-cycle deadline; Isla’s agency drives the structural insight that forecloses flooding. Council’s concession feels earned through irrefutable logic, but the resolution’s ease slightly softens the cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: bypass design reweights "harmonize" as engineering synthesis. Final image (tear + gears) offers resonant answer without moralizing, though "motivation" phrasing risks abstraction before embodiment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Machinist POV signature shines in technical diction ("calibrated分流 channels," adhesive analysis) and stress-modulated rhythm. "Dappled resolve" slightly abstract but quickly grounded by physical action; Kael’s dialogue carries subtext without overwriting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; peak beats ("dust rained," "tear of relief") achieve visceral clarity. Figurative language is sparse and purpose-driven, with closure image ("grime on her cheek") delivering maximum propulsion without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: volcano’s "breathing" as structural clock transforms tropes. Emotional specificity (relief as tear, not triumph) avoids safety middle; every detail serves the balance premise without gimmickry.</comment>
