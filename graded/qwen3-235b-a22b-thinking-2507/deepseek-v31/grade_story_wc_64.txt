<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (blithe vs. gravity) earned through tactile decoding, but stakes lack visceral pressure; "shape of intentions" motivation remains abstract without concrete cost escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully—Elara's choice to re-bury the locket forecloses possession with visible cost ("blithe no longer"), but lens ambiguity (Accumulative vs. Hybrid) prevents 9.5.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cobalt silo's chill and starlight directly constrain choices (cold floor, beam guiding discovery); sovereign case's warming charges the final image as physical manifestation of emotional cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes ("shape of intentions") never tighten meaningfully; discovery unfolds passively without opposition or tactical shift—pressure accumulates but lacks agency-driven escalation required for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from tapestry decoding ("tenderly organized chaos" → gambit of love), but final image's "story concluded" slightly overstates the earned ambiguity of hidden histories.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("gardener’s intuition for patterns") shines, but micro-choices lack tactical consequence; decoding feels inevitable rather than pressured under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops, but "knotted, colored silks... fractured from its story" overwrites tension; near-closure metaphor dilutes propulsion without harming final image's charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess/gardening metaphors into "gambit of love" feels inevitable, though cobalt silo's celestial map risks derivative cosmic symbolism without deeper transformation.</comment>
