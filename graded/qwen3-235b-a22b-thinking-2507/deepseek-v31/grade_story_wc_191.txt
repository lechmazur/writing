<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; motivation is clear but single-minded. "Wisely adventurous" trait informs action but no internal tension during vine evasion weakens micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: abandoning orchard for responsibility with felt cost ("ruby flake cooled in my palm"). Causal lens holds throughout; sunrise deadline tightens options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orchard’s ozone/fruit smell and waterfall’s prismatic barrier directly constrain choices. "Crystalline trees that sang" slightly ornamental but bioluminescent apples charge final image by enabling the fruit’s discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from mural to physical peril; vine attack forces evasion. Cost—leaving the orchard’s perfection—is legible but could deepen the sacrifice beyond physical departure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "nostalgia was for what we had been" reweights the throne as responsibility, not conquest. Avoids moralizing; final image resonates without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("spectral imager," "toxic blooms") filters all details. Voice modulates from clinical ("plascrete spray") to lyrical ("liquid galaxy") under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "roaring cascade felt like stepping through a liquid galaxy" shows high density. "Tense, silent creep" slightly generic but compensated by precise "temporal distortions" specificity in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: stairway as celestial path transforms throne trope. "Futuristic nostalgia" avoids cliché through bioluminescent apples and neutron-star navigation. Risk-taking (physical quest for digital keeper) heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
