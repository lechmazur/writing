<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's embodied motivation ("interrogate the silence") and contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. fear of the unknown) drive credible micro-choices, but Valerius remains symbolically thin despite pivotal role. Final renunciation of student identity earned through tactile learning ("patiently nimble" hands pouring tea), though ghost-reveal slightly outpaces prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: Valerius fading against meteor streaks while Elara grasps the seal. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density buildup (summer-to-autumn garden shift), though midpoint lens ambiguity (-0.3) prevents 9.0. Cost proof solid in "translucent against the streaking sky" image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rooftop garden functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choices (Valerius never leaves roof) and charges closure: meteor-illuminated parapet makes ghost-reveal inevitable. Sensory details ("dry lavender," "brittle skeletons of autumn") filter through Elara’s building-linguist POV, avoiding static description. Final image’s "cool seal" in hand reweights prior tactile lessons.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deciphering building’s language) tightens through Valerius’s incremental revelations, culminating in meteor-shower confrontation where Elara’s agency ("truly interrogate him") forces crystallization. Cost legible in Valerius’s fading form, though secondary pressure (her own apartment’s whispers) underutilized. One meaningful deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "agreed upon lies" motif reweighted at closure: silence isn’t borrowed sugar but covenant with architecture. Final image ("scribe ready to write next chapter") offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite high concept, though "language of every beam" borders on abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sagging joists language," "subjunctive mood of ironwork") sustains accumulative lens. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" phrasing, but rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure ("silent detonations" during meteor climax). Dialogue carries subtext without over-explanation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with near-zero loops; "papery rustle of a thing" shows rhythmic precision. Slight overwriting in "fragrant exhalation of damp earth" (density penalty -0.2), but final image’s "cool seal" avoids closure muddle. Paragraph cuts align with emotional cadence shifts, though "transparent" typo disrupts momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope through architectural linguistics lens; "dead language tutor" made fresh via building-as-text metaphor. Risk-taking (metaphysical reveal during meteor shower) heightens stakes coherently. Avoids derivative safety with morally ambiguous custodianship ("not burden but gift"). Specificity in desk seal’s "generations of thumbs" elevates.</comment>
