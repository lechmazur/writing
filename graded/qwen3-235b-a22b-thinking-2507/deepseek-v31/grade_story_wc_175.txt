<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Silas pivots from planned chronicle to honoring the moth's death; "held breath" embodiment and micro-choice to knot the wing reveal hierarchy of values. Flaw: slight abstraction in "transient rootedness" realization lacks visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("knotted a fracture in the world’s memory") under Accumulative lens; hawk’s interruption tightens pressure meaningfully. Orientation clear by word 40; lens unambiguous by midpoint with patterned accumulation of stillness/breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grotto’s micro-setting (moss, willow, wing) constrains every choice—knotting requires delicate moss evidence, arches use willow—and charges final image as wing glows "like a tiny lantern." Sensory hierarchy masterfully narrows to tactile urgency during hawk crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via hawk’s interruption: honoring migration shifts to honoring a specific death, narrowing Silas’ options to monument-building. Cost is visible in abandoned signal-rebuilding and the wing’s fragility; escalation driven entirely by his agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through wing’s reprise: "the story was still whole" answers "how to honor loss" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; complexity lies in valuing anonymous death amid grand tragedy. Final image reweights transience as purpose, not loneliness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "papery whisper of wings" and "blushing stillness"—Silas’ lexicon filters nature through archival urgency. Rhythmic control peaks during hawk scene with fractured syntax ("sharp crack, panicked thrashing") mirroring shock.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "held breath" slightly overwrought but redeemed by context. Zero loops/scaffold—each line advances atmosphere or stakes. Final line’s "story was still whole" achieves density without muddle, charging closure with crystalline simplicity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "last migration" trope via moth wing’s specificity; risk-taking (lyric structure, quiet closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth in Silas’ shift from observer to node—not savior—avoids sentimentality. Synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
