<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in misalignment panic versus required calm, but pre-crisis characterization lacks depth for full 9.0; the dread of sorrow's volume emerges organically yet feels under-rooted in prior traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "she held its precise measure" crystallizes the cost of becoming grief's container, with Accumulative lens holding through sensory density escalation; mineralized gloves reconfigure options with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bronze grotto actively constrains choices—calcification spreads via its mineral logic, and final image of stone-gloved hands directly charges closure; environment isn't backdrop but causal agent in the transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by protagonist's internal state under Accumulative lens: panic-induced misalignment intensifies calcification, with cost legible in "thin, delicate lace of mineralized grief" reweighting the burden-collection premise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through concrete particulars: "whalebone reverie" evolving into marble-gloved containment offers non-literal answer to sorrow's weight without moralizing; final image reweights prior material with devastating emotional economy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("greedy eye" flame, "shingled hush") and rhythmic control peak during crisis—staccato panic sentences compressing into acceptance's fluidity—demonstrate masterful voice modulation under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; every line multiplies purpose: "jolt of anguish, cold and desperate" embodies emotion while advancing plot, with crystallization description maintaining visceral clarity in high-pressure closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via fractal-weaver specificity; "whalebone reverie" as structural metaphor feels inevitable yet fresh, with risk-taking (stone gloves as earned containment) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
