<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear but interior contradiction lacks visceral embodiment; "profound bound release" edges toward abstract label without specific cost. Micro-choices like swaddling show purpose but don’t deepen her struggle under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with conceptual cost (rekindled dawn as promise), but the felt cost remains oblique; no tangible sacrifice like a character’s exhaustion or irreversible light loss anchors the stakes. Lens holds as Accumulative/Textural.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard actively constrains choices: swaddled fruits demand cloth-spinning, mica window’s shards enable song recovery. Final image of light woven into "new tapestry" charges the setting’s stakes with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes (rekindling realm) are clear but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure; the memory shock is coincidental, not earned through Elara’s agency. Community singing deepens stakes yet omits visible trade-offs like vocal strain or fading hope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through swaddling light and woven dawns, avoiding moralizing. Final image of "woven dawn" reweights the premise non-literally, though "bound release" slightly veers toward abstraction without concrete cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("pearlescent glow," "shock of memory") and rhythmic control shine, especially in the singing sequence. Minor register drift in "profound bound release" prevents 9.0 despite otherwise immaculate POV consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but "fragile orb" and "diminishing light" dilute specificity. Final line’s "triumphant, shared song" risks sentimentality; no loops or scaffold, yet subtle dilution in peak beats caps near 8.3.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "woven dawns" through tactile alchemy (swaddling light, mica shards) avoids trope. Emotional truth in community reconnection elevates, though the core premise doesn’t fully transcend familiar rebirth arcs.</comment>
