<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (skepticism vs maternal belief) drive micro-choices; bone-setting ritual embodies competence/struggle without therapy-speak. Final truce choice earned through historian’s logic ("bridge, not weapon") with cost in Leo’s injury.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: tooth held as truce crystallizes options with cost ("arm bent at cruel, unnatural angle"). Hybrid lens (causal/accumulative) holds; orientation clear by line 3. Missing one tightening beat pre-portal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Secret garden’s iron-rich fountain and oak roots constrain choice (tooth discovery) and charge final image. Tooth as micro-setting directly enables portal creation and truce. No white-room syndrome; sensory details reflect urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when tooth shifts grief to action, but Fae’s non-malicious emergence lacks escalation. Cost visible in Leo’s injury, yet pressure softens too quickly; agency strong but resolution lacks meaningful trade-off beyond initial risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "mistakes into constellations" motif: tooth error becomes compass, then truce bridge. Final image reweights premise without moralizing; avoids false equivalence in Fae’s ambiguous stance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("historian’s eye," "waxen effigy") filters all description. Rhythm modulates from grief’s calm to portal’s urgency. Zero register drift; no head-hopping despite high stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "chilling duplicate" and "cradle of roots" exemplify textural specificity. Final paragraph’s propulsion ("air thickened, light bent") avoids purple prose. Closure image crystal-clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms changeling trope via historian’s lens and bone-setting heritage. "Nostalgic innovation" tone and tooth-as-constellation metaphor feel inevitable. Avoids middle-ground hedging in Fae’s ambiguous truce.</comment>
