<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when fireworks shatter her focus yet catalyze epiphany; embodied emotion ("trembling fingers," flinch-turned-listening) avoids therapy-speak. Final choice to hear chaos as symphony earns closure through prior sonic sensitivity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly when she realizes "to love silence, one must first forgive sound," with visible cost in her physical recoil and redefined worldview. Fireworks' intrusion slightly undermines Accumulative escalation by coincidence, not agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Workshop tools (brass coils, quartz) constrain her tuning method, charging the final image where journal becomes "limitless catalog." Sonic waveforms etched in paper transform setting into active character, fulfilling 9+ gate by shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Accumulative pressure as sonic tuning intensifies, narrowing options to one resonant frequency. Fireworks' eruption forces the CR moment, but their coincidence slightly weakens protagonist-driven escalation under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through her grandfather's waveforms: "music in cacophony" reframes silence without moralizing. Final image of fireworks as "next entry" reweights the central question with conceptual cost, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "painting with sound" and "hiss of ascent"; rhythmic control shifts from precise ("micron to the left") to fluid during epiphany. No head-hopping; compression taught early pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "silken quiet, thick and deep" slightly dulls momentum, but "groan of an old oak" exemplifies textural specificity. No loops in peak beats; final line’s cadence ("magnificent, noisy silence") propels closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pacifism-through-sound science transforms tropes; "catalog of silence" reframes empathy via luthier’s waveforms. Risk-taking (silence as active listening) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable post-reveal.</comment>
