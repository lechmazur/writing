<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("work not to forget pain but contextualize it") drives micro-choices; embodied grief ("clenched fist of sadness") avoids label-speak; final renunciation of penance earned by soldier's artifact without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis crystallizes with felt cost ("heart began to open") under Accumulative lens; orientation clear by paragraph 1; lens held through "archaeologist of grace" reconfiguration without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>File room particulates and button constrain discovery; dust patterns enable reading the letter; final image ("carefully unfurled from stack... button") charges closure through micro-setting specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake (contextualizing grief) tightens through Elias's deepening realization; agency in reframing abandonment as kindness; cost legible in physical heart imagery during pivotal shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through button's "cold, hard promise" not moralizing; final "archaeologist of grace" image reweights foster care history without stating morals; avoids sentimentality via "refused to ignore surrounding pain".</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("dust patterns settled into ink's grooves") reflects archivist POV; rhythmic control varies from brittle-page fragility to flowing reflection; no register drift during high-pressure discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; "plume of particulates bloomed" achieves textural density; final line's cadence ("carefully unfurled from stack... button") delivers closure without figurative muddle; propulsion through concrete verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms foster care trope via Civil War artifact; specificity of "button worn almost smooth" avoids generic symbolism; emotional truth in "he had been seen" reframing abandonment with bold risk.</comment>
