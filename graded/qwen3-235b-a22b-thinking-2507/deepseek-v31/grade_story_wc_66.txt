<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—precision copyist vs. rebellious creator—drive her transformation; micro-choices like gathering dust embody her "thistled calm" motivation without therapy-speak. Final renunciation of passivity earns closure through prior causality, though flaw integration lacks deeper compounding mistakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (her life now dedicated to transmission), and Accumulative lens holds through sensory accumulation. Orientation is clear by 100 words, but conservatory discovery lacks sufficient pressure escalation—convenience slightly undermines causal weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The alcove, radio glow, and luminous dust function as micro-setting that actively constrains choices (dust on slate/transmitter) and charges the final image; specificity reflects her musician’s precision without static cataloging. Environment is indispensable to closure’s resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (breaking story famine) tightens via her realization that "cloak" means nurture, narrowing options to transmission. Cost—her identity shift—is legible, but conservatory discovery lacks meaningful obstacle, weakening escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (dust’s stories, radio transmission), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "silence" as fertile ground. Nearly flawless, but "teach dust to tell stories" borders on thematic echo, slightly diluting earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (musician’s tactile precision applied to dust) and rhythmic control during humming scenes deepen under pressure; voice modulates from muted to luminous without head-hopping. Elision of conservatory search is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with high density; "silver powder coated a stone shelf" exemplifies textural specificity. One paraphrase loop ("her work was precision, her life was quiet") in opening slightly dulls momentum but doesn’t touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "magic dust" trope through orchestra copyist specificity and story famine stakes; emotional truth in dust’s leaf-memory tale avoids gimmickry. Risk-taking (sound as teaching tool) heightens stakes, but premise lacks one fresh inflection for 9.0+.</comment>
