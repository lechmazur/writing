<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied struggle ("trembling," "muddled and dull" self-perception) but lacks contradictory impulses during pivotal trade; Lyra's choice feels inevitable rather than earned through visible value hierarchy conflict. Micro-choices limited to accepting reed, weakening agency under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("her world, once gray...") crystallizes irrevocable cost with undeniable pressure under Accumulative lens. Sensory accumulation ("shimmering silver aura," "ruby light") perfectly reweights stakes through density increase. Orientation anchored by line 3; cost proof explicit in "infinitely, imperfectly, profound."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Furnace heat and plant energy signatures constrain Lyra's new perception, charging the final image ("painted the song of the silent reed"). Micro-setting (reed tongue) functions as essential tool, evolving from "instrument of change" to ritual object. Avoids white-room syndrome through tactile silica/plant details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seeing true beauty) tightens via sensory deepening under Accumulative lens; "softened, then sharpened" reweights options with felt cost (permanent sight loss). Agency is passive acceptance fitting the lens, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure shift during awakening beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final line ("resonance beneath... perceived by the soul") reweights premise without moralizing, emerging from Lyra's embodied experience. Avoids thematic echo by showing "inner light" paintings rather than stating wisdom; complexity lies in beauty found through loss, not false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("monochrome world a cage," "heat radiating as silver aura") modulates rhythm from lyrical ("crimson rebirth") to sparse ("Now"). Elara's "shifting sand" voice contrasts Lyra's textured internal cadence; zero head-hopping despite perspective swap.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "vibration passed through teeth" shows specificity without muddle. Final line's rhythmic triad ("infinitely, imperfectly, profound") propels closure. No figurative overwriting in peak awakening scene—sensory details ("cobalt and gold energy") serve propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "bartered sight" trope through concrete mechanics (plant language, reed tongue) and emotional specificity (colorblind artist finding beauty in energy signatures). Risks lyrical density but avoids gimmickry; "perfect imperfection of essence" synthesizes premise with undeniable authenticity.</comment>
