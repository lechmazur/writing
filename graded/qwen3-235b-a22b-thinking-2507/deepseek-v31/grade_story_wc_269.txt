<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: Elara's "anchor to past tragedy" versus "adrift in possibility" manifests physically in dual tapping rhythms at closure. Motivation rooted in coral loss avoids therapy-speak—"quiet anchor in her chest" embodies conflict. No secondary character, so relationship bullets irrelevant; micro-choices (assembling kit, diagnostic focus) reveal prioritization under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: floating above the reef, she reconciles witness/loss with discovery/possibility, the "shrunken kingdom" making cost undeniable. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds through salt-damp atlas details, hydrological data, and rhythmic tapping converging in the final mask image. Minor slip: atlas discovery borders on convenient but earns payoff through her assembly process.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Dive mask constrains choice and charges closure: fingers tapping its glass merge tool, body, and environment into the dual rhythm for loss/endurance. Station's submerged legs mirror "periodically eternal" tide, making setting active pressure. Micro-setting qualification fully met—mask isn't backdrop but the literal interface for her reconciliation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's agency: coordinates trigger hydrological research, reframing "calibrated hope" into tangible pilgrimage. Cost is visceral in "smaller than old stories"—the reef's diminished state forecloses naive optimism. Escalation under Accumulative lens succeeds via density (atlas, data, dive) reweighting the dominant stake: survival isn't binary but a "continuum" with visible fragility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the final tapping rhythm—a "beat for what was lost, slower beat for what endured" answers why paths disappear/reappear without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; "healing was not a single event" is earned via the reef's physical reality. Complexity embraced: hope isn't triumph but bittersweet endurance with "conceptual cost" in the shrunken kingdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "obstinately vivid" sea blue, tidal-pattern tapping, and "calibrated hope" reflect her oceanographer lens. Under stress, syntax compresses ("She began to assemble..."), then flows for the reef discovery. Minor register drift in "calibrated hope" but justified as professional lexicon; no POV leakage in this single-character piece.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythm to match pressure (staccato for discovery, lyrical for reef). "Salt damp" atlas detail does triple duty: texture, backstory cue, and hope catalyst. Final line achieves poetic density without muddle—"beat for what was lost, slower beat for what endured" crystallizes theme through concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms climate tropes: hope isn't pristine nature but a "shrunken kingdom," recovery as fragile continuum. Fresh inflection via "periodically eternal" tide reframing time, and atlas as salt-damp artifact (not clean prop). Emotional truth in "tenacious holdout" coral—avoids generic optimism through specificity of hydrological refuge.</comment>
