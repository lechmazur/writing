<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied through sensory-specific emotional pairs (joy/sorrow of daughter's birth/erasure); micro-choices during vivification attempts reveal value hierarchy with visible cost ("bottomless grief"). No diagnostic label-speak despite high-stakes crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "He was no longer a survivor. He was simply" crystallizes the Accumulative/Textural lens. Psychic wave vision slightly edges toward coincidence but pays off in stance crystallization ("pride for a self that never was").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting constraint: the floating rock dojo ("last stable point") actively pressures choices and charges the final image ("speck of order in chaos" mirrored in integrated self). Brain-in-jar handled with clinical specificity ("folds shimmering with stolen life") that shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative escalation through protagonist-driven emotional pairings (joy/sorrow, trust/betrayal) meaningfully tightens pressure each attempt. Dominant stake (defeating numbness) reweights with visceral cost: "agonizing, beautiful friction of feeling everything." No coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (daughter's birth/erasure), not abstraction. Final image "He was simply" delivers non-literal answer to central question without moralizing. Avoids false balance by treating numbness as valid but incomplete state.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: numb POV filters chaos through clinical detachment ("cold, vast distance") that fractures during vivification. Rhythmic control under pressure—short sentences for crisis ("He did not shy away"), flowing cadence for reflection. Zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion ("mountains melted into seas and empires faded to myth"). Final line's simplicity ("He was simply") delivers maximum impact without figurative muddle. No template cadence even during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "brain in jar" trope through emotionally specific vivification mechanics. Risk-taking (internal conflict as sole plot driver) heightens stakes coherently. "Complementary opposites" method feels inevitable in hindsight through prior emotional pairings.</comment>
