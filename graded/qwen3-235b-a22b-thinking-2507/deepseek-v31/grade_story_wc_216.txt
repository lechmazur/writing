<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in Leo’s "borrowed-time" existence deepens through tactile micro-choices (thumb on shard); the young woman’s recognition crystallizes his shift from isolation to connection with visible cost—no therapy-speak, only embodied resonance in the final line.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty: "emerald silo" anchor delayed past 120 words, applying −0.4. Closure is Earned Stasis (foreclosing isolation via connection), with cost legible in "smooth, cool comfort of connection," but orientation flaw caps high-band eligibility per global gates.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Q2 orientation penalty caps Q3 at 7.0; the silo’s rust-streaked walls and shard’s texture constrain Leo’s choices, but setting details remain atmospheric rather than actively shaping tactics until the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens: embedding messages deepens Leo’s quiet obsession until the woman’s recognition reweights the stake (texture of time) with felt cost—her words reframing the shard’s meaning narrows his path from futility to shared perception.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (urn shard, garage tags); the final image reweights "texture of time" as connection without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite the woman’s articulate insight aligning with Leo’s quest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Leo’s time-keeper lexicon ("measured existence," "stolen moments"); rhythmic control peaks in the timeless moment’s description, with compression taught early and paid off in the resonant closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in lines like "holds water but not moments" charges momentum. Near-miss: "anticipated mysteries" slightly borders on thematic abstraction but avoids full echo by serving character-specific observation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "timekeeper" trope through embodied specificity (thumb-worn shard groove); the garage-sale method feels inevitable for a man who measures in increments, avoiding derivative safety with the woman’s non-verbal recognition as the fresh inflection.</comment>
