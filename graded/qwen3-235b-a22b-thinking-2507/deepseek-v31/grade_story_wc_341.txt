<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in panic versus scientific duty ("focused on the work"), but "quietly explosive tension" flirts with label-speak. Final choice as participant/observer earns cost through physical peril becoming atmospheric record.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: density increases through cloud observations until cosmic realization. Charged Poise closure lands with conceptual cost—"her own determination etched into atmosphere"—reconfiguring the premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sky gondola functions as micro-setting: its creak and rail constrain choices during ascent. Final image ("silent speck in immense, remembering dark") charged by the vellum scroll's physicality, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (proving sky holds memory) deepens via ascent. Agency in continuing observations under threat creates visible cost (physical danger), but "quietly explosive" label lacks tactical impact to reach 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through contrails of feeling; "spooled wholeness" transforms from method to cosmic truth. Final image ("archivist and archived") reweights premise without moralizing, satisfying Q5 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("somber, grieving gray" clouds) persists under stress. Slight register drift in "effervescent joy" during crisis, but rhythmic control in ascent sequence compensates.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>No scaffold loops; high density ("woven from ice and memory"). "Quietly explosive tension" causes minor coherence clash (explosive vs. stillness), but final image’s propulsion saves Q7 from artifact penalties.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorology and emotion psychology feels inevitable. Risk-taking (cosmic memory library) heightens stakes without gimmickry, satisfying Q8 9+ test with emotional specificity.</comment>
