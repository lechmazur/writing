<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (practical skipper vs. letter warmth) drives cairn choice; embodied emotion via sea glass grip and tool arrangement. Slight motivation gap in ghost confrontation—shift from "not ghosts" to spiritual defense lacks micro-choice escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost: cairn reconfigures space as "I am here" with visible effort. Accumulative lens holds—pressure tightens via sensory escalation (moans → void) to defiant geometry. Ghost’s retreat slightly softens cost legibility at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting (iron floor, gears) constrains choices: tools build cairn, jar hides in mechanism. Sea glass and tools charge final image (warmth, deliberate cairn). "Haunted" rules feel generic but serviceable for length.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect letters as safety) tightens via ghost targeting their "warmth." Elias’s cairn action narrows options through agency—stone language as weapon. Cost legible in physical effort, but ghost’s letter-focused motive lacks prior causality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: cairn reweights stone messages as barricade without moralizing. Final image ("luminescent ache of human connection") answers "safety" question via charged particulars. No thematic echo—resonance earned by letter vulnerability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: notices tools, weather, small details ("frosty green sea glass"). Rhythm modulates under stress (short "No." amid long dread). "Luminescent ache" risks elevation but justified by letter-writing voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion via concrete verbs ("rattled," "shuddered," "arranged"). Final line recharges sea glass motif with earned hope. "Luminescent ache" borders purple but avoids muddle through thematic precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ghost targets human connection, not violence; stone messages become defense. Emotional truth in anonymous letters avoids tropes. Specific details (bait box replies, fuel pump delay) ground risk-taking without gimmickry.</comment>
