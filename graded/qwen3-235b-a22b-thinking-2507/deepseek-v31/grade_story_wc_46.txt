<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (earthbound yet star-focused) drives her shift from passive watching to active sharing; embodied epiphany via sea glass polishing avoids therapy-speak; final choice renounces fire-based light with visible cost in "her watching was over."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: grotto's "dark shadow" vs. her "profound purpose" crystallizes stakes; Accumulative lens holds through sensory density; orientation anchors (coast, mist, dawn) established by paragraph 1 without disorientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Serpentine grotto constrains choice (polishing by touch in dampness) and charges final image ("dark shadow" transformed by her carrying its light); sea glass's physical properties enable the revelation, making environment indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Single dominant stake ("share light without fire") tightens through polishing deepening; agency in her renunciation of torches forecloses prior path with felt cost ("watching was over"); escalation driven by protagonist's micro-choices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sea glass behavior ("it breathed") not moralizing; final image of "reflective pearls of light" reweights grandmother's "pearl of stillness" as actionable wisdom without abstraction; avoids thematic echo in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "zephyr bloom tone" and "serpentine grotto"; rhythmic control shifts from meditative ("slow, meditative process") to decisive ("her sharing had begun"); no head-hopping despite reflective fragments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "foggy surface began to clear" shows via action; strategic telling compresses backstory; final line "ready to be given away" charges closure with active rhythm, no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms sea glass trope through specific physics (amplifying ambient light vs. fire's consumption); "reflective pearls" synthesis feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
