<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s quiet listening vs. Leo’s vocal regret; embodied emotion in "breath hitched, ragged sound" avoids therapy-speak. Micro-choice placing locket (not speaking) reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost. Slight over-tidiness in Leo’s confession arc prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "profound calm settled... eye of a lifelong storm." Accumulative lens holds—density peaks in hospital beat where locket reconfiguration crystallizes stakes. Orientation clear by line 15; no causality breaks. Minor lens ambiguity early caps score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Micro-setting (locket) constrains choice: its cold weight and photos charge final image. "Particulate silence" and courtyard’s "sandstorm calm" mirror internal states without cliché. Sensory selection narrows under pressure (e.g., hospital focus on blanket texture). Late courtyard return lacks spatial constraint for 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (healing through listening) tightens via neighborhood fragments → hospital confrontation. Agency-driven escalation: Elara’s method forecloses interrogation path. Cost legible in Leo’s "spent and trembling" state. Accident coincidence complicates but doesn’t resolve; minor knowledge leap (envelope connection) prevents higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through locket’s journey: "listening heals" reweighted as carrying stories, not fixing. Final image ("peace actively woven") avoids moralizing. Risks thematic echo with "deepest silences" but saved by concrete action. Lacks meaningful ambiguity—Anya’s absence unexplored—to reach 9.0.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature sharp ("particulate silence," "landscape of pain"). Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity (short sentences during confession). Hospital dialogue carries subtext; "You found her" reconfigures meaning. Slight register drift in "profound solidarity of a witness" caps score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Zero loops but "fragments offered over tea" and "threads began to weave" create synonym churn (-0.2). "Sparrow sigh" metaphor brilliant; "landscape of pain" edges toward cliché. Final line avoids overwriting. Filter-verb stacks absent, but minor density issues in middle beat prevent 8.5+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: thrift curator as truth-hunter transforms "lost love" trope through object-based listening. Emotional specificity in Leo’s regret ("too young and terrified to face becoming a father") avoids generality. Courtyard motif resists abstraction. Lacks bold risk-taking for 9.0—structure too conventional.</comment>
