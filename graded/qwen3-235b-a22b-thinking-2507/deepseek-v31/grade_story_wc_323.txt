<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (pride vs cage) and embodied curiosity drive choices, but "balancedly curious" label breaks immersion; final teaching mission lacks visible cost despite thematic closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with clean chain-link activation → star navigation → course transmission, but conceptual cost (shattered worldview) lacks visceral charge in the uplift moment; closure feels earned but emotionally smoothed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bioluminescent spires and synthesized basalt create immersive specificity; the dome dissolving into "unfolded horizon" charges the final image, though city functions more as metaphor than active constraint on choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes ("expand understanding vs huddle in dark") escalate cleanly through her navigation attempts, but The Visitor’s benevolent response removes tension without trade-off; conceptual cost isn’t viscerally felt despite thematic weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through navigation metaphors ("sail on light" reweights the opening "cage"), avoiding moralizing; final line implies ongoing struggle without stating a lesson, resonating through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature via navigation lexicon ("thermocline," "edge geometry"); rhythmic compression during dome activation ("She was breathless") heightens pressure, though "balancedly curious" disrupts voice consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, but "feeble defiance" and "shattered" verge on cliché; final paragraph’s "path was open... learn to navigate it" has subtle redundancy dulling closure’s precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deep-sea setting and navigation lens transforms first-contact tropes; emotional specificity in her instructor’s mind cataloging stars elevates beyond familiar alien-map resolutions.</comment>
