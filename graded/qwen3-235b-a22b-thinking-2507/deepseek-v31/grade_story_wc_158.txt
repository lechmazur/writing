<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but lacks contradictory impulses during pivotal carving; "failure; her words were dust" is label-only emotion without embodied degradation under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly with planetary hum softening to sigh; cost crystallized in "centuries of insomnia broken" though time dilation in "across centuries" slightly muddies causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shell setting actively constrains choices—ear pressed to wall conducts lullaby, carving alters tactics—and charges final image; "broken moon" generic but offset by pearlescent interior specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through sensory deepening (soil ache → lullaby harmony) with felt cost in exhaustion; "blossom armistice" concept lacks on-page tactical pressure despite thematic weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (carving lullaby reweights pain as peace) without moralizing; final "reef-shadow joy" risks sentimentality but avoids explicit echo via bodily specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("throne of a fallen cathedral" blends geological/religious bias) with rhythmic control; minor register drift in "photosynthesizing geological pain" disrupts lexicon consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops but "throne of a fallen cathedral" creates mixed metaphor violating physical logic; "complex happiness" feels abstract in high-pressure beat, slightly dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of geological trauma and sonic treaty transforms insomniac trope; "blossom armistice" reconfigures peace as active fragility with emotional truth in final stillness.</comment>
