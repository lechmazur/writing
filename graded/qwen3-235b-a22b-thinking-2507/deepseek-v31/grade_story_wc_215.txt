<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's interior contradiction (solitude vs. duty) drives every choice; his "tranquilly perceptive" trait manifests concretely through water-for-farmer micro-choice and box-cleaning endurance. Ghost woman's silent pressure creates authentic stakes without dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "tangible weight" on Silas's shoulders and ghosts' paused repetitions crystallize the reconfigured stakes. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—the density shift from observing ghosts to safeguarding the box tightens options irrevocably.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rotting honey house micro-setting directly enables the box discovery; the wasteland's desolation charges the final image as the glowing box "ignites" against ash. Environment constrains choice (dust/rot obscuring the artifact) and reweights closure through color contrast.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the woman ghost's disruptive gaze—a single escalation that transforms passive observation into active preservation. Cost is legible in Silas's "tangible weight" acceptance, though the Accumulative lens limits causal pressure depth for 9.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the box's panels (sowing/blight/parting hands), avoiding moralizing. The final image—"vibrant panels against desolation"—reweights "tangled covenant" as conceptual cost without stating a moral, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "contextual clues" framing (dust circles = forgotten game); rhythm modulates from measured observation to urgent discovery. Zero head-hopping despite dual presences; elision of ghost origins taught early and paid off by the box's story.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "stubborn patch of green defiance" and "mute eloquence" compress meaning without muddle. Final line "It was enough" charges closure through concrete action (shared silence), avoiding abstract sentimentality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms ghost tropes via "silent stories" mechanic; beekeeping oasis grounds universals in verifiable detail (fallen logs hiding box). Risk-taking in wordless communication heightens stakes without gimmickry, but lacks one fresh inflection for 9.0+.</comment>
