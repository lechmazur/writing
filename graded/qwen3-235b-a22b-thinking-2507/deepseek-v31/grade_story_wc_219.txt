<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction (skepticism vs. emerging release) drives her micro-choice with the amber, but the "chemistry of letting go" line risks diagnostic label-speak; saved by embodied warmth replacing rigidity in the final walk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Elara’s "different person on the same path" crystallizes irreversible internal shift with conceptual cost (shedding skepticism), sustained under Accumulative/Textural lens through sensory accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The fly amber constrains choice (triggering her pivot) and charges the final image (clenched in her hand), while "bronze quiet" shapes perception; micro-setting elevates beyond atmospheric decoration to active pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes (skepticism vs. acceptance) tighten via the path’s psychological pressure, but the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral; the "impossible conclusion" deepens knowledge sufficiently for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the amber’s reweighted meaning (data point to metaphor for impermanence), avoiding moralizing; the final walk embodies "chemistry of release" as resonant, non-literal answer to homecoming.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("luminous skeptic" lens) permeates diction ("verifiable data," "dusty footprints"), with rhythmic control in high-pressure beats; "bronze quiet" exemplifies character-particular sensory bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "aged metal" warmth crystallizes complex emotion without labels. Slight redundancy in "impossibly old object on a path that should have been new" prevents 9.3+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "first contact" trope via pilgrimage-as-ritual, with emotional specificity in Elara’s scientific rebellion; risk-taking (conceptual closure over action) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
