<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via bolt/handprint duality; "seraphically mundane" trait lacks visible tradeoffs despite strong embodied emotion in piano scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: "frostbitten hope" crystallizes stakes through the silent chord's resonance; nerve regeneration timing slightly convenient but not causal break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: bolt constrains choice (discovery/restoration), handprint charges closure; "cobalt" descriptor underutilized despite strong atmospheric specificity in snow-shrouded decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation through Accumulative lens: handprint discovery deepens "safety vs truth" stake; cost legible in throat sensation and "sterile safety" realization, though silence policy's origin lacks on-page complication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</comment><comment>Theme emerges through piano restoration and silent chord—no moralizing; "safety purchased with suppression" skirts thematic echo but redeemed by physicality of "resonated through wood and into his bones."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless: "frozen tread," "pinprick of warmth" embody Leo's state; rhythmic control intensifies during piano scene with no head-hopping or register drift under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-zero artifacts; "seraphically mundane" risks purple prose but earns place through repetition; single paraphrase loop in reflection paragraph ("chaotic refuge... messy noise") costs 0.2.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "gilded cage" trope via surgical voice deactivation and piano bench bolt; cobalt fortress concept slightly generic but transformed by snow-shrouded handprint discovery.</comment>
