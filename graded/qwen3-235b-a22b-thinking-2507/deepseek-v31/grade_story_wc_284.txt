<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority shines via pillbox habit and scar embodiment, with final choice earned through "fixing what’s broken" causality. Woman remains underdeveloped, limiting relationship crucible despite pivotal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: "risk that could end with him in a concrete cell" crystallizes cost as snow melts. Situational lens holds, but pillbox’s shift from anxiety object to recording tool lacks one beat of preparation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zephyr Bluff’s mist and snow actively constrain choices (enabling codes, urgency of melting), while pillbox charges the final image. Spring’s "damp cold" lacks tactical pressure, missing full micro-setting integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten purely through situational pressure: compromised channels → snow codes → need for credible source. Cost ("concrete cell") is unmistakable and shapes Elias’s irreversible vouchsafe choice under coherent environmental constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Fixing what’s broken" emerges organically through pillbox, scars, and snow message. Final powder-recording image reweights the theme without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo while charging the closure with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("map of old pain," "silver hush") modulates under pressure. Voice remains consistent through high-stakes beats, with no POV leaks or register drift during Elias’s decisive shift from "rasp" to firm command.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "tame serpents" and "ephemeral message" show textural specificity. Minor overwriting in "waxy, sculpted testament" slightly muddles one peak beat, but propulsion remains flawless toward closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms spy tropes via snow codes and burned-spy perspective. Emotional specificity in "phantom ache of melted skin" avoids generic trauma, while pillbox’s dual function (anxiety object/recording tool) feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
