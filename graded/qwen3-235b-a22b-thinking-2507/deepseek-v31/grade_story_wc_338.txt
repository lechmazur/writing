<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her methodical curiosity vs. empathetic whisper; embodied emotion ("heart began to beat a rhythmic thrum") avoids therapy-speak. Final choice to sit at threshold earns endurance with visible cost—the weight of centuries as blanket.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: sitting atop steps forecloses descent with felt cost ("weight of centuries pressing... not as burden"). Accumulative lens holds; shadow discrepancy tightens options under protagonist agency. Cost legible in "silence offered its trust."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rain-scoured stone and keystone constrain choice (whispering vs. forcing); the map tear isn't backdrop but active threshold. Sensory hierarchy sharpens urgency—crisp digital light vs. grainy film. Final image recharges "cartographer of silence" with "new map taking shape in quiet."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (interpreting silence) tightens via shadow discrepancy, narrowing options to empathy over force. Cost is visceral: centuries' weight reconfigured as "blanket," not burden. Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens—no coincidence resolves; whisper earns stairway reveal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "known and unknown were not divided; they were in conversation." Final image ("holding its silent, patient gaze") reweights the map tear without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; wisdom arises from shadow observation and whisper.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("listening with her eyes") defines voice; rhythmic control deepens under pressure ("a minute discrepancy, a whisper of change"). No head-hopping; syntax mirrors her focus ("frame by shadowy frame"). Elision of pilgrims' history taught early via "whispered chapel" lore.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "finely-honed instrument" shows rather than tells. Final line recharges map motif with precision. Minor deduction: slight synonym churn in "methodical curiosity" vs. "shielded openness" in adjacent beats, but no closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms discovery trope via empathy-driven solution; emotional specificity in "gratitude for the silence kept" avoids generic templates. Risk-taking: denying descent into henge heightens stakes. Fresh synthesis—map-framer redefining "tear" as threshold—feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
