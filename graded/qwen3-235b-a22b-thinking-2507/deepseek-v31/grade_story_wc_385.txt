<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices (e.g., "sang not for navigation, but to listen"), with final renunciation of solitude for sacred duty carrying visible cost. No therapy-speak, but trader's underutilized presence slightly weakens relationship crucible potential.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: stars watching as melancholy lifts into solemn duty crystallizes the cost of eternal remembrance. Accumulative lens holds—density builds via echo layers until the nexus chorus coheres with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stone canyon and nexus aren't backdrop but active constraints—their acoustics directly shape Elara's purpose and final song. The recurring shell charges the climax when held aloft to "tune the chaos," meeting 9+ gate for micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through knowledge deepening (shell → text → nexus), with her method driving escalation under Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable in "melancholy lifted, replaced by solemn duty," though trader's role could heighten external pressure earlier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete actions: "echo as canyon's sacred commitment" crystallizes without moralizing. Final image of her voice joining the "eternal chorus" reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—no thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct ("hearing histories in reflected notes"), with rhythm modulating from sparse discovery to flowing nexus climax. Zero head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure's resonant final line.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Near-flawless density: "opalescent and cool" replaces generic shell description, and "chaotic chorus of every echo" avoids sensory checklist. Minor paraphrase loop ("whispering at once... weave together") prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "chosen one" trope via geological memory—echoes as canyon's active choice, not passive acoustics. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "universe hums" slightly edges toward familiar cosmic tropes.</comment>
