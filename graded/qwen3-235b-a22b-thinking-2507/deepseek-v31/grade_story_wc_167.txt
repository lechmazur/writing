<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in "heart wasn't in it" versus craft pride; micro-choice of pebble throw reveals hierarchy of values. Epiphany slightly over-articulated ("to be the stone...") risks diagnostic tone but redeemed by concrete bench action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: window completion reconfigures options with felt cost ("no longer illustrating a myth"). Accumulative lens holds through ripple-to-glass pattern deepening; "before everything shifted" crystallizes conceptual cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pearl Bay's still water isn't backdrop but constraint enabling pivotal ripple observation; prism atrium's refracted light directly charges final "dazzling shower" closure. Micro-setting (pebble/water) alters protagonist's entire approach to craft.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (craft feeling meaningless) tightens via ripple observation deepening into worldview shift. Agency-driven escalation; cost legible in prior frustration transforming to "new urgency" without retroactive fixes. Single meaningful deepening sufficient for scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through embodied glass/water motifs: "window as lens" answers central question without moralizing. Final image reweights "mundane labor" into "instrument for seeing," avoiding thematic echo while embracing complexity of artistic value.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Glazier's light-focused perceptual signature ("saw world as flaws") shapes all observation; rhythm modulates from staccato frustration to flowing epiphany. Compression of port expansion backstory taught early and pays off in closure's temporal pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "concentric circles began to expand" avoids filter verbs, "smoked glass" water crystallizes metaphor. Minor deduction for "profound commune" abstraction, but immediately redeemed by physical ripple description in next line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms artist-block trope through specific glazier lens; "noctilucent reckoning" phrasing fresh but not pretentious. Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off via prism/water motif integration, avoiding middle-ground hedging.</comment>
