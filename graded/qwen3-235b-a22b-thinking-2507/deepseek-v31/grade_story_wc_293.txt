<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("never" mantra vs emerging spark) drives action; micro-choice aligning glass with landscape reveals hierarchy of values. "Luminous disbelief" borders on label-speak but redeemed by concrete handling of flake and truck fender contact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "never burned away" crystallized in "ash on the wind" and "road ahead pixelated." Causal lens holds through glass-to-map progression. Minor abstraction in "burned away" prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Wet-plate glass flake functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (must align with landscape) and charges final image ("road ahead pixelated"). Mountain pulloff's vastness pressures Elias' solitude, evolving into active resource for the map.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias' agency: recounting details leads to scaffold realization, narrowing options to the logging path. Cost ("never burned away") legible but slightly abstract; "ash on the wind" makes it visceral. Dominant stake (overcoming "never") signaled early and tightened meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "pixelated amnesty" reweights "never" as remade possibility. Final image ("road ahead pixelated, infinite, and entirely his") offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo while embracing complexity of second chances.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dynamically observant," noticing coat seams) and rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful orthography ("lěngmò") taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally with emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("chilled and slightly damp as if just developed"). Final image avoids figurative muddle. Minor abstraction in "luminous disbelief" redeemed by concrete action, but prevents 9.0. Propulsion maintained through varied syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope through specific, grounded choices: collodion glass flake, scaffold wrap mechanics. Emotional truth in "never" struggle avoids generic templates. Fresh inflection in "pixelated amnesty" grows from established particulars without gimmickry.</comment>
