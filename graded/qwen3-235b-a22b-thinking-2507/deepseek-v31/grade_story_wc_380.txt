<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation ("to find where deleted memories go") drives credible micro-choices (hiding gravity fluctuations, secret coffee readings). Missing contradictory impulses in climax—memory return is purely beautiful without complexity, weakening the earned renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: silence lifting with sea sounds reconfigures stakes with felt cost. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, but cost legibility falters slightly—"weight was finally gone" tells rather than shows the release after vivid prior showing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Salt chamber constrains choices (gravity seizures during excavation) and charges the final image (memory-light blooming). Recurring pressed flowers meet 9+ gate by altering tactics and reweighting closure—indispensable to the memory-recovery logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes (recovering excised memories) tighten through gravity-pocket escalations, but lack deeper transformation. Agency in exhume action narrows options credibly, though the cost (physical strain) feels underdeveloped versus the thematic weight of memory return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: wildflowers shift from "ghost" evidence to vessels of lost joy. Final image (leaving memories in the chamber) reweights "where deleted memories go" without moralizing—resonant ambiguity lingers in the "sacred tomb" charge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>Distinct harbor-keeper perceptual signature ("oil lamp bleeding light into void," pier planks' "hollow rhythm"). Rhythmic control frays slightly in climax—"memory-light" feels generic, diluting the otherwise precise, voice-motivated diction under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor scaffolding: "She understood her task" tells rather than shows decision-making. No fatal loops, but final line's "weight was finally gone" redundantly states what the lifted silence and sea sounds already embodied, muddying the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms memory tropes through salt-crystal specificity and grief-as-gravity physics. Fresh inflection in "pressed wildflowers" as memory vessels, but emotional scope avoids complexity (no painful memories surface), limiting the risk-taking elevation potential.</comment>
