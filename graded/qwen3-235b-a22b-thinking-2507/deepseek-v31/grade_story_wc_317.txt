<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("safeguard space for innovation") is concrete through her proprietorship and embodied in planting the seed. Minor deduction: internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses during the pivotal burial scene; her racing heart shows tension but no hesitation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully—the "permanent" storm-born silence crystallizes victory with visible cost (exchanged anonymity for preserved innovation space). Causal lens holds perfectly, though the corporate reveal slightly rushes the escalation beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The brook and wet earth function as micro-setting that constrains choice (night planting) and charges the final image ("scent of wet earth"). Only flaw: "nocturnal haven" description remains slightly postcard-like early on without immediate pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is flawlessly causal: seed → coordinates → corporate threat → planting as weaponized action. The cost is unmistakable in Elara’s "racing heart" and the permanent silence—agency drives every narrowing of options without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically through the corpse flower symbolizing precarious innovation; the ending reweights "storm-born silence" as victory without moralizing. Slight deduction for early tell-y phrasing ("safeguard space for innovation") before scene demonstration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sequence of crafted conundrums," "lock waiting for a key") persists under pressure. Rhythmic control shines in sparse planting scene ("earth was soft in her hands")—no head-hopping, elision taught early via "mystery seed mail" pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "sky scrubbed clean by earlier rain" shows textural specificity. One minor abstraction ("quiet current of understanding") in high-pressure beat, but redeemed by immediate concrete action ("buried the seed deep"). Zero loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms eco-thriller tropes via specific voice ("proprietor of impossible exits") and thematic precision. Risk-taking in making legal maneuver the climax feels inevitable; "storm-born silence" as victory metric avoids cliché. Freshness in corpse flower as innovation symbol.</comment>
