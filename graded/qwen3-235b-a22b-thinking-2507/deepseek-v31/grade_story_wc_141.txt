<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (skeptic vs. believer) drive the final renunciation, but "burden settled... as purpose" slightly neats the cost, softening the felt stakes in the climax beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with legible cost ("tears streaked through dust... burden settled"), yet the emotional price feels conceptually light for the universe-altering revelation at the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The seashell constrains choice (placement on cello bridge) and charges the final image ("heart humming"), but the observatory remains atmospheric rather than pressuring tactics despite "perfect dish" rationale.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation through density increase (hum → images → understanding) reweights the stake, but protagonist agency fades during reception—the Signal unfolds passively rather than through her choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through cello resonance and Elara's shift from debunker to affirmer, though "burden settled... as purpose" edges toward uplift, slightly thinning the moral complexity in the final beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice modulates perfectly under stress ("Tentatively, she drew the bow"), but "profound, ancient loneliness" momentarily drifts into abstraction, diluting character-particular perception during peak resonance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion crystallizes in "tears streaked through dust on Elara's face, but she was smiling"—dual action with no filter verbs. One hairline slip: "profound" slightly generic in the alien consciousness beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of myth-buster confronting her own myth via cello resonance feels inevitable, with shell/nebula specificity transforming alien-contact tropes. No safety-hedging in Elara's flawed, human-scale revelation.</comment>
