<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear motivation ("scaffold complexity") drives action, but lacks contradictory impulses during crisis; "perpetually learning" trait shown via carving insight yet no visible internal tradeoffs under pressure weaken 9+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost (storm's "malice" lessening implying prevented chaos), but "whisper as feeling" coiled in mind" introduces minor causality vagueness; lens (Hybrid) holds through decisive physical act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid coastal atmosphere anchors early, yet storm/arch never actively constrain tactics—driftwood comes from van, not setting; micro-setting (fracture lines) charges climax but fails 9+ gate requiring environment to shape tactics/final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten credibly (storm tears seam → carve quickly), but escalation leans on slide's exposition rather than protagonist's agency; cost ("malice" shift) legible yet not unmistakable under Hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "scaffold simplicity" motif; final blank slide reweights duty without moralizing; avoids binaries by framing storm as entropic chaos, not evil, with resonant non-literal closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct sculptor POV ("finding whales in gnarled wood") with rhythmic control under pressure, but "turbine-hum reverie" during panic slightly drifts from crisis-appropriate lexicon; no head-hopping preserves cohesion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("deceptively simple curve" trimmed to essential); "petrified leviathan" fresh metaphor; final line recharges motif cleanly without figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "timewoven alliances" via sculptor's lens avoids chosen-one tropes; emotional truth in quiet guardianship duty elevates familiar archetype, though coastal guardian framework lacks radical novelty for 9+.</comment>
