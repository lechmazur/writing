<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in concrete action ("kneel on cool floor," "chalk circle smudged by his own feet") avoids stock phrasing; contradictory impulses (creating identities while remaining anonymous) culminate in earned renunciation of permanence as the cleaners erase evidence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: "meaning was already in transit" crystallizes the stakes with visible cost (erased chalk circle), fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens through density increase in the final image reweighting "analog" as merciful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (chalk circle) constrains the ritual's spatial logic and charges the final image; arcade's "polished floors" and "holographic fortune teller" pressure choices through dawn's temporal limits and impending cleaners.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation via accumulative density: the chalk-writing ritual narrows options to the cerulean curve, with tangible cost in the smudged circle's erasure; stakes deepen through "what you'll miss" exchange without causal shortcuts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through charged particulars ("weight of a dog’s head," "cerulean blue curve"), avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights "analog" as merciful without stating a moral, resisting tidy binaries about digital/analog.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dormant energy," "futuristic nostalgia") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control shifts from lyrical dawn descriptions to tight syntax during chalk ritual ("swift, arcane strokes"), with zero POV leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in lines like "building a soul from colored dust" serves plot without muddle; final cadence shift ("melted into the growing crowd") propels closure without figurative clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of analog resistance through surface mail ritual; transforms "identity creator" trope via chalk codes and marginalia focus, avoiding derivative safety with specific cost (ephemeral chalk vs. permanent digital erasure).</comment>
