<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "bent but unbroken" botanical study versus smudging the leaf, embodying his method. Micro-choices like tracing the drawing reveal hierarchy of values. Lacks visible friction during data verification, slightly weakening motivation escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "auroral sorrow settling into resolve" crystallizes reconfigured stakes with conceptual cost ("world unprepared for its language"). Orientation anchors by line 5. Lens holds as accumulative/textural pressure builds through data density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting dominates: the brass weight constrains choices (anchoring drawing, final tactile anchor) and charges closure. Sensory details like "rough wool blanket scratchy against his chin" reflect convalescent urgency. Environment actively shapes tactics via harmonic terminal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Rhys' agency—rejecting clean logs for marginal data—reweighting "swaying certainties" with felt cost. Pressure coheres under accumulative lens but urgency lacks visceral immediacy; valleys' peril remains abstract despite "terrifying freedom" realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: the smudged leaf, harmonic spike, and brass weight reconfigure "peripherally aware" into earned wisdom. Final image avoids moralizing while charging the central question—"bent but unbroken" forget-me-not mirrored in his resolve.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "crisp hollow of convalescence" and rhythm shifts with fever-recovery state. Compression taught early ("memory blurred charcoal sketch") pays off in data-density climax. Zero register drift under stress; diction stays precise to meteorologist's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fault-tolerated right past the apocalypse" risks metaphor strain but pays off conceptually. Every line multi-tasks: "heart hammering not with fever but with dread" advances plot, character, and atmosphere. Final line crystallizes closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorological precision and botanical fragility transforms "oracle" trope. Emotional truth in forget-me-not mirroring resilience avoids cliché. Harmonic vibration detail feels specific and non-obvious, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
