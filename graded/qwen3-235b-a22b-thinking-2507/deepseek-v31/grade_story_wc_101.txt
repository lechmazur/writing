<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Kael's "weight strapped to his soul" vs community-building drive; Maever's apple burial reveals values through micro-choice with embodied cost ("trembling hands"). Slight motivation shift from rejecting dependence to embracing Maever's method lacks sufficient friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: Kael's decision to "declare the truth" reframes hope as internal strength. Accumulative lens holds throughout with sensory density ("rhythmic scrape of stone on stone") tightening stakes. Final image reconfigures the bell's meaning without mechanical resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor functions as micro-setting: "color of dusk" pillars anchor place/time early, and final bell-ringing charges closure. Bell's physicality ("gentle persistence against silence") constrains choices, but sanctions-era scarcity lacks tactile integration beyond citrus as luxury. Cap at 8.8 per gate rule as no environment constrains tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Kael's agency (hiding to observe) narrows options to truth vs sustaining hope. Cost crystallizes in "he would give them a different story" – conceptual price of truth for communal resilience. Single tightening suffices at this length, though sanctions' mechanical pressure could deepen.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: bell as "thread stitching exiles" becomes tool for crafting hope. Final image reweights "gently persistent" into communal strength without moralizing. Maever's buried apple embodies earned wisdom – no abstraction, only "trembling hands" charging the closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless: "sun bled into valleys," "brittle scrub" filter through Kael's urgency. Rhythmic control under pressure with short sentences during stakeout. Minor slip: "motivation sharper than hunger pang" borders on diagnostic but saved by immediate action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "practiced, soundless efficiency" shows rather than tells. High density with "ancient clay pillars weathered to dusk" doing triple duty. Final line's cadence shift ("prepare to declare... give them a different story") propels closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "mystery benefactor" trope through Maever's quiet sacrifice – emotional specificity in "burying one item each night" avoids cliché. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off, though terra-cotta arbor could feel fresher. Derivative premise guardrail avoided via concrete scarcity details.</comment>
