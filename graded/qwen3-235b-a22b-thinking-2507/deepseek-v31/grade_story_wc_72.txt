<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Veridian’s shift from absolute certainty to welcoming nuance is embodied in concrete micro-choices (threading the flaw, shattering the ampoule), with contradictory impulses—guardian vs liberator—acting simultaneously during the climax. No therapy-speak; anguish is physically manifested through stone dissolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change with unmistakable cost: Veridian’s dissolution ("form begin to dissolve, not into rubble, but into pure, conscious sand") directly results from his agency-driven choice to shatter the ampoule, fulfilling causal linkage under the Causal lens without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The underwater garden’s micro-setting (structural weakness in the dome, the ampoule’s placement) actively constrains Veridian’s tactics, culminating in the fissure enabling the psychic thread. Coral/anemones evolve causally with the prison’s unraveling, charging the final image of "grains... joining the current."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven solely by Veridian’s agency: each micro-choice (shifting coral, dislodging stone) narrows options under mounting psychic pressure, with the self-shattering act imposing a visceral, irreversible cost that reconfigures the dominant stake (prison vs liberation) in the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—the dissolution of certainty into "nuanced nothingness"—without moralizing. The final image (scattered grains threading toward open sea) resonates as a non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting "certainty" as a weaponized lie through lived sacrifice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV’s perceptual signature is distinct ("perceived the water not as emptiness, but as a conduit"), with syntax modulating under pressure (short, fractured rhythms during the shattering). Zero head-hopping; the stone-bound lexicon remains consistent even in dissolution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels the climax. The "silent supernova" metaphor crystallizes the ampoule’s rupture without muddle, and the final sentence’s rhythmic cadence ("threading their way through the broken dome") elevates closure without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms the "statue guardian" trope through telepathic mechanics and emotional specificity—Veridian’s "profound and grateful welcome" during dissolution avoids cliché. Risk-taking (inanimate POV) heightens stakes coherently, with the garden’s rebirth feeling inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
