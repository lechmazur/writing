<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("truth simple and solid" vs. fluid reality) drives closure choice; embodied emotion ("frantic drum") avoids therapy-speak. Slight underdevelopment of flaw's origins prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("shock was quiet and total" reordering his world). Accumulative lens holds via sensory alignment beats; no causality breaks despite minimal opposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Canal landmarks constrain sundial interpretation; water's "serene upheaval" charges final image. Micro-setting (sundial) directly shapes climax. Q2<9.0 caps Q3 at 8.9 despite meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes viscerally felt through physical reactions ("frantic drum"), but escalation lacks meaningful resistance beyond environmental decay. Conceptual cost legible though pressure tightens only once.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tapestry's transformation from "mirror for lies" to "map for specific truth." Final image ("silence... full of resolved truth") answers central question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (noticing "slime-slick metal," "tea-colored water") modulates with tension. Rhythmic control shines in "careful agony" unfurling sequence; zero POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "serene upheaval" recharges opening silence with earned density. One borderline purple phrase ("frantic drum") doesn't muddy closure's crystalline final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "tapestry showing lies' architecture" becomes personalized key rather than universal tool. Transformation test passed—plot fails with generic forest/compass substitutes.</comment>
