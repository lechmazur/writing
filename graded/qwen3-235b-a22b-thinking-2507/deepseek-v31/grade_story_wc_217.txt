<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "not to repair it for flight, but to transform its story"—embodied choice over label. Micro-choices (reverent feather extraction, binding splintered spar) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost: child’s grief made sacred through action, not therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly—"loss made sacred" reweights rupture with conceptual cost. Lens ambiguity: Accumulative/Textural dominates (density increase via woven dawns), but feather/kite coincidence slightly undermines causal purity at inciting incident, preventing 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Environment actively constrains: lagoon’s "placid water" enables wading, shore-grass binds spar. Final image’s "drake’s feather caught the sun" charges closure with iridescence as tangible cost—environment shapes tactics and meaning, clearing 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: "harmonizing discord" becomes active weaving, narrowing options from flight to artifact. Cost is felt in "child’s momentary sorrow" woven into resilience. One deepening suffices, but moral calculus lacks competing goods friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "woven dawns" reprise—final line transforms it from reflection to active legacy. No moralizing; "incomplete as invitation" resonates through feather-kite fusion. Avoids sentimentality by grounding "sacred" loss in tactile details like splintered spar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "sort[ing] squall of gulls from lap of wavelets"—bias toward fractured beauty shapes noticing. Rhythm modulates from hushed cadence to urgent "crack," with no head-hopping. "Burnished hush" pays off as earned motif.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "woven dawns" appears twice with purposeful reweighting. Final line’s "transformed beauty for the dawn to discover" recharges opening motif without cliché. Propulsion flawless: "crack" splits sentence structure mirroring kite’s fall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "beauty in broken" trope through specific acts: binding splinters with shore-grass, not abstract philosophy. Risk-taking in quiet closure earns distinction, but emotional complexity lacks friction—Elara’s certainty slightly softens stakes.</comment>
