<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak but "quiet blaze" risks diagnostic label; embodied emotion strong yet micro-choices lack visible tradeoffs during climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("carried the map home inside him"), Accumulative lens held through ultrasonic pressure buildup to the stillpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Skin-as-setting constrains every choice; petrified tree’s glass surface charges final image through tactile specificity and irreversible absorption.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via ultrasonic trail’s intensifying pressure, but forest’s sorrow resolution lacks visible tactical cost beyond emotional overwhelm at the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tactile absorption ("raw, first language of feeling"), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "mapmaker" into "cartographer of the soul" without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("heard with his mind") remains consistent; tension modulates through ultrasonic pulses, though "cool, persistent fire" slightly dilutes sensory focus under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops but "a single, held breath of the night sky" risks scaffold; propulsion falters momentarily in lyrical time description before tightening at the clearing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Blind mapmaker premise transformed through skin-reading mechanics; ultrasonic forest reconfigures sensory tropes with emotional stillpoint as non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
