<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "different fear" moment where preservation instinct overrides safety, embodied through trembling hands copying music. Slight tell in "fear of this song dying with her" lacks visceral physicality but micro-choice to send Argos earns closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: meteorite shifts from "chain" to "anchor" as pigeon vanishes, with felt cost in risking exposure. Draft dislodging folio walks the coincidence line but complications feel earned under Accumulative lens; cost legible in "weight... grounding anchor, not a chain."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Attic functions as micro-setting that charges closure: decaying paper supplies the folio, and "blooming, withering" motif evolves from decay to sacred growth in final image. Dust motes constrain ritual tactics while yellowed ink scent embodies thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when draft dislodges folio—preserving songs now demands action with visible cost (exposure risk). Agency crystallizes in copying music/sending pigeon under Accumulative escalation; "fear of this song dying" reweights safety stakes with tangible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: unsent songs become sheet music, meteorite's purpose shifts from fiction-anchor to balance-symbol. Final image reweights "blooming, withering" without moralizing—decay becomes "sacred," peace "growing from withering past" answers central question resonantly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "frantic galaxy of dust motes" and "voice cracking from disuse" shows rhythmic control under pressure. Minor abstraction in "motive... answered by a ghost" slightly dilutes immediacy, but syntax modulates perfectly from deliberate ritual to urgent pigeon release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cold and dense in her palm" exemplifies textural specificity. Single mixed metaphor ("blooming, withering tone") in reflection beat, but final image redeems it. Propulsion flawless—"clattering onto books" to "light as a breath" drives momentum without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms pigeon courier trope: meteorite balancing ritual as metaphor for emotional equilibrium, unsent songs as sheet music. Avoids war-music clichés through specific "Canticle for the Unreturned" discovery. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry—cosmic stone grounding human fragility.</comment>
