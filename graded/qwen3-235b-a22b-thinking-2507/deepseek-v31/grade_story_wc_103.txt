<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s trapped-yet-racing mind, but the mother’s sudden corporeal return lacks visible micro-choices to ground the reunion’s emotional cost beyond the photos’ disintegration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the photos’ disintegration charges the final image with conceptual cost ("texture of time" made tangible), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through the living bridge’s settled geometry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The living bridge functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (pruning triggers discovery) and charges the final image; boxwood’s grain directly mirrors the "grain of time" theme with tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via protagonist agency (re-calculating space through geometry), but the single tightening lacks felt cost until closure; the photos’ fade as "calibrations" deepens knowledge without narrowing options earlier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the halo fragment’s evolution from ghostly shard to disused artifact, reweighting "texture of time" via the final handhold—a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("grain of wood," "scent of years") modulates under pressure, though the vision-mother’s dialogue risks thematic echo despite its ghostly framing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-perfect propulsion, but "quaking reverie" and "sand through an hourglass" verge on stock phrasing in the opening beat, slightly dulling immediacy without muddying closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synthesizes maze design with hyperbolic geometry into an inevitable emotional resolution; the "temporal equation" premise transforms tropes through botanical specificity and earned stakes.</comment>
