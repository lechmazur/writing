<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Kaelen's acceptance of integrated remorse versus erasure; embodied grief ("knees buckled," "icy cold counterpoint") avoids therapy-speak. Final endurance earns cost through prior causality but micro-choices lack distinct value hierarchy under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost ("exhausted and hollowed out") under Accumulative/Textural lens; pressure accumulates via sensory density shift from "brittle sturdiness" to "clean, wet stone." Orientation clear by line 3; lens consistent throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Coral pavilion constrains every key choice (touching oyster, digestion process) and charges final image ("taste of rain"). Frost-rimed sand under boots alters tactics; environment actively shapes climax. Micro-setting (oyster's iridescence) becomes final powder, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (containing remorse's corrosive power) tightens through Kaelen's agency during subsumption; visible cost in physical collapse forecloses escape. Escalation via emotional density shift ("not a taste anymore; direct transfusion") meets Accumulative lens rigor. One tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action ("sandpaper rough memories" → "rendered peaceful"), not abstraction. Final image reweights "sorrowful flavors" into "taste of rain" without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality via integrated cost ("remorse is now his, but no longer toxic").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature (taste-centric POV) sustains under pressure with rhythmic control ("sharp and brittle as coral"). Compression taught early ("close of an unspoken dream") pays off in closure. Minor register drift in "alchemist’s crucible" slightly jars during crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion via concrete verbs ("crumbling," "slumped"). "Psychic aftertaste" slightly clinical in peak beat; "fire of shared anguish" edges toward mixed metaphor but redeemed by sensory coherence. Final line’s reprise charges closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of culinary alchemy with emotional archaeology. "Coral icebound pavilion" transforms desert trope through specific stakes; risk-taking (memory-tasting mechanic) heightens coherence. Transformation test passed—plot fails if premise genericized.</comment>
