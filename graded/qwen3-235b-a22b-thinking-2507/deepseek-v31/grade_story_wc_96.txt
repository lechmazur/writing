<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Silas's molting identity vs constant core motivation; embodied emotions avoid therapy-speak. Minor deduction for Elara's underdeveloped motivation beyond "rebuilding what system discarded."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: Silas's molt becoming evolution, not escape. Final image crystallizes stakes with "luminous fracture mended... with trust." Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds flawlessly through moon-to-dawn cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rusted library functions as micro-setting that charges closure: "starry vault of their rusted cathedral" reweights dome's "skeletal web" with conceptual cost. Moonlight actively reveals shredded Whitman, constraining their work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (smuggling hope) escalates via coffee tin discovery, narrowing options. Cost is visceral: Silas's molt now purposeful evolution. Slight deduction as smuggling execution occurs off-page, softening peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete acts: inscribing flowers on smuggled books, not moralizing. Final line reweights "luminous fracture" into earned wisdom without stated moral. Avoids thematic echo in closing paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Silas notices "practiced, tender hands" on shredded Whitman. Rhythm modulates from "cold light made ghosts" to urgent "pried at it... false bottom gave way." No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; "satchel made of patchwork scraps" shows not tells. Minor paraphrase in "rebuilding what system discarded" → "rebuild world within world" costs 0.3. Closure image ("awaited the dawn") crystal-clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms prison library trope through specific, lived details: coffee tin's lithographed flowers, monthly molting as thematic engine. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
