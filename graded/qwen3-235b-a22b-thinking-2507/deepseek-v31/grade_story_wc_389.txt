<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in peak choice; "lonely visionary" motivation is consistent but micro-choices under pressure (e.g., transcription tremor vs resolve) don't reveal layered value hierarchy. Flawed competence shown only through isolation, not active mistakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis (rejecting both tyrannies) with legible cost in "alone, but no longer lonely." Orientation perfect by line 3. Hybrid lens (Accumulative pressure via static density) holds, though escalation lacks one visible tactical cost pre-climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt glass portico constrains choice (amplifying signal) and charges final image (prism effect). Storm pressure woven into brass mechanisms' "frantic shadows" during adjustment. Meets 9+ gate via tool-as-setting charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single tightening (simultaneous voices) narrows options effectively under Accumulative lens. Cost legible in closure, but "weeks" of transmissions lack felt time-pressure; no tactical cost paid during escalation (e.g., fatigue, equipment failure) weakens agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through cobalt glass transformation (prison to prism), answering "tyranny vs understanding" without moralizing. Final image reweights "ancient shadows" as tools for dawn, avoiding false binaries. No thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("symphony of chaotic sound") with rhythmic control during storm escalation. Compression taught early ("fragmented radio frequencies"). No POV leakage; stress shortens syntax ("Gritty resolve hardened within him").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless density; only minor paraphrase loop in radio description ("chaotic sound—numbers stations, distant music, and ghostly echo"). Zero figurative muddle in peak beats. Final line's "impossible colors" recharges cobalt glass with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "radio prophecy" trope via cobalt glass mechanics. "Gritty whimsy" tone avoids cliché through brass/vacuum tube specificity. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; emotional specificity in "thrill that was not fear" elevates.</comment>
