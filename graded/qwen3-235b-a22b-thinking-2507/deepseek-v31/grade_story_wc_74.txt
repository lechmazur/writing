<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's embodied insomnia and creative block drive choices, but the stranger's reappearance lacks causal groundwork; "long since sunk" memory contradicts her sudden recognition without earned shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with "I remembered" crystallizing urban anonymity's cost, though brush magic's rules remain unestablished, slightly undercutting causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rooftop greenhouse functions as essential micro-setting—grime-receding glass enables moonlight magic—but smog-choked city backdrop stays ornamental rather than constraining choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via moonlight pressure (brush glow → luminous script), but escalation leans on coincidence (stranger's return) rather than protagonist-driven agency under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through saffron crocus recharging "saffron quiet"; no moralizing, just proof that "strangers remember kindness" in final resonant image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct painterly voice ("waxing moon’s glow," "grit of industry") with pressure-appropriate compression, though "methodically hopeful" violates BRR by exceeding reflection limits without altering present action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero closure artifacts; "thriving saffron crocus" crystallizes final image. Minor synonym loop ("hollow stillness"/"stagnant slumber") costs 0.1 but avoids momentum drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms magical realism via painterly specificity (abalone shell, water-script), but moon-tipped brush edges toward derivative fantasy without sufficient rule-establishment.</comment>
