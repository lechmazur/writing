<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("quietly explosive" vs dye-master precision) drives agency; heart integration earned through sun-trail tracking micro-choice. No diagnostic labels—embodied cost in "thrumbing" organ becoming "integrated instrument."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: "answer was not a why, but a how" reweights premise with undeniable cost in heart's transformation. Accumulative lens held—pressure builds through iridescence motif until illumination scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Morpho wing as micro-setting constrains choice (angle-dependent truth) and charges closure via projected light. Floating rock's vines anchor spatial logic during pivotal revelation, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (narrative magnetism) tightens through Hira's sun-trail method—agency-driven deepening forecloses "why" quest. Cost crystallizes in heart's shift from "foreign thing" to perception instrument, legible at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from dye-master specifics ("extraction from root and stone") not abstraction. Final image reweights magnetism as cultivated "how," avoiding moralizing while charging prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dye-master perceptual signature ("color as breath") modulates under pressure—syntax compresses to "magnetizing him" during climax. Zero voice convergence; river-stone eyes description shows controlled focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops—every phrase advances meaning ("iridescent caution" does triple duty). Slight register drift in "ethereal light" (-0.1) but voice-motivated; gold powder illumination avoids purple prose through concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms transplant trope via dye chemistry lens; "magnetism" rooted in tangible craft. Risk distinction (+0.3) for sun-trail tracking method—unconventional yet coherent with dye-master precision.</comment>
