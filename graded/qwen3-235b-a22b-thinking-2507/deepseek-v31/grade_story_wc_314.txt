<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when logic fails and she acts on "terrifying faith," but the transition from hidden vulnerability to decisive action lacks one micro-choice showing internal struggle against her stern persona during the raptor attack.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with the crystal's reflection embodying earned harmony, but the raptor's defeat via single flame feels slightly convenient—causal linkage lacks one beat showing failed attempts or cost escalation before success.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Environment constrains choice perfectly: the waterfall's light creates the crystal's "suspended state," and its "ancient freshness" charges the final image as a "blessing" after her emotional breakthrough.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when the raptor threatens the crystal, but escalation lacks visceral cost—her panic ("cold and sharp") isn't deepened by a tangible loss (e.g., near-shattering) before the solution emerges.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the starlings' dance reconfiguring her "logic and intuition" quest; the final crystal reflection avoids moralizing by showing—not stating—the synthesis as embodied warmth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct (scientific cataloging vs. emotional resonance), but tense shifts slightly when "she understood the patterns" intrudes with omniscient certainty beyond her frantic POV during the attack.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush and precise ("waxen leaf," "fading echo of her flame"), but adjacent sentences—"logical mind cataloging" followed by "analytical mind delighted"—create a paraphrase loop dulling momentum in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ingenuity lies in transforming flock behavior into a mathematical language of survival, but the "kaleidoscopic waterfall" setting risks derivative fantasy tropes without deeper world-logic constraints on her alchemy.</comment>
