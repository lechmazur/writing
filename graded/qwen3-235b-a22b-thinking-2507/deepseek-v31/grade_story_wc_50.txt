<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "peripherally focused" trait driving both discovery and obsessive repair; embodied emotion via "faint, dying whispers" avoids labels. Final renunciation of decay's permanence earned through tactile gear work with visible cost in "wounded season" context.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "land had been given back its hidden heart" reconfigures stakes against "decaying world" while "wounded season outside would not end immediately" proves cost legibility. Causal lens holds via meticulous repair sequence narrowing options to resonator tuning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marble cavern actively constrains choices: quartz veins guide light mapping, acoustics dictate repair logic. Final image charged by "echo followed her out, a promise stored deep in stone" where setting becomes the preserved wonder itself, not backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: studying reflection angles transforms abstract "harvest of echoes" into actionable blueprint, foreclosing replication path. Cost crystallizes in "wounded season" context—preservation succeeds but decay persists, reweighting victory through tangible environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of preserving wonder against decay emerges purely through concrete action: "storing intangible wonder... within reasoned cellar" crystallizes in final resonator tuning. No moralizing; closure image reweights premise as "promise stored deep in stone" without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("peripherally focused," acoustic sensitivity) creates distinct rhythm: short clauses during gear work ("She forged new gears...") contrast lyrical cavern descriptions. No head-hopping; pressure modulates voice from obsessive to clarified without syntax collapse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Minor scaffolding in "Driven by a quiet, obsessive need to mend it" slightly tells where showing would heighten. Otherwise flawless propulsion: "a chord missing its key note" demonstrates sensory specificity. Zero loops in closure beat maintains crystalline final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms "locksmith" trope: sonic engineering via brass/crystal mechanics feels inevitable. Emotional specificity in "storing wonder for later" avoids abstraction. Bold risk in conceptualizing "echo harvest" deepens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
