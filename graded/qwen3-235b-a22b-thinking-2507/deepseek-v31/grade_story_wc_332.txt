<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority excels with embodied longing ("cipher encoded in the very air"), but the cost of transformation remains emotionally abstract despite palpable warmth; micro-choices like painting without water reveal values, yet the resolution’s low stakes limit causal weight for high-band entry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("permanent afterglow," "new hum in tides"), fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens through sensory density buildup; the single deepening—painting the dream—reconfigures stakes cleanly, though the cost’s subtlety barely misses 9.0’s "unmistakable" threshold.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lighthouse and palette function as micro-settings that constrain choice (dawn timing, brush technique) and charge the final photograph; sensory details like "crushed pearls" paints shimmer with purpose, avoiding white-room syndrome while mirroring Elara’s luminous absence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara’s agency—discovering then wielding the palette—foreclosing passive longing with the palpable cost of transformed tides; the single escalation suffices for length, though the positive outcome softens cost legibility versus traditional sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: longing as "key," not void, reweighted by the final image where the photograph captures the dream; no moralizing, only resonant subtext in "remade a small piece of the world," avoiding thematic echo while inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("murmured against the shore," "luminous with absence") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control in lyrical cadences ("fragile moment when night’s deepest dark concedes to light") teaches and pays off its pattern without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("strand of liquid gold that hung in atmosphere") propels momentum without muddle; every line advances atmosphere or character, with the final image’s "warm and complete" resonance avoiding overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms artist-trope via librarian protagonist and air-painting; specificity ("drowned jewels" palette, whispering tides) synthesizes longing into fresh emotional logic; risk-taking (magical realism) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
