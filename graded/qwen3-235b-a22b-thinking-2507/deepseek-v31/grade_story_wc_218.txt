<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "brazen calm" as embodied action (wire-looping as "gentle coaxing"), not summary. Final choice earned by lifetime of botanical work, with visible cost in "body thinning." Slight deduction for underdeveloped timeframe integration into daily choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: stone's "curious" vibration crystallizes options with felt cost ("tears cutting clean paths"). Accumulative lens holds via sensory density buildup to the star-flower evening climax. Persistent constraint (dying body vs. thickening copper) shapes every tactic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Copper wire (micro-setting) constrains choice and charges final image ("humming through copper and stone"). Temple orchard actively pressures decisions via lithicore-root dynamics. "Mossy plinth" and "dappled light" show lived-in specificity, though seasonal/time markers could deepen urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through bodily cost ("body thinning") and escalating vibration density. Single meaningful deepening (copper network completion) reconfigures options under Accumulative lens. Cost undeniable in the orchard's transformation with Elara's tears—no convenient resolutions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: "gentle coaxing" wire loops versus "graceful motion" stone shifts. Final image ("dialogue etched in living stone") reweights premise without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by showing scholars' awe rather than stating "respect."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: scientific precision ("resonant frequency") blended with poetic observation ("tears cutting clean paths"). Rhythmic control peaks in climax ("complex, rhythmic pattern resonated in my very bones"). Minor register drift in "perpetual beginning" abstract phrase.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "looped it, a gentle coaxing rather than a bind" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Final line’s triple repetition ("copper and stone and root") achieves crystalline rhythm. One near-miss with "profound peace" abstraction, but redeemed by bodily tears.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "communication with nature" trope via lithicore vibration physics and architectural secrets. Emotional specificity in working "toward a perpetual beginning" while dying avoids sentimentality. Orchards-as-dialogue image feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
