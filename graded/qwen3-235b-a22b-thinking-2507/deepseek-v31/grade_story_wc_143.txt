<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s "funeral for a world that hadn’t yet died" metaphor, embodying curiosity and grief simultaneously; micro-choices (triggering acid, enduring vibration) reveal her hierarchy of values with tangible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: her endurance against approaching machines crystallizes irreversible loss with visceral cost ("vibration hum through soles"), under Accumulative/Textural lens where sensory density reweights the "dawning hush" stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Moonlit summit functions as micro-setting; the geiger-camera’s radioactive calibration and sand grain’s dissolution constrain choices and charge the final image, making environment inseparable from closure’s cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation via the sand timer’s 17-minute countdown narrows options relentlessly under Accumulative lens; cost is unmistakable as the machines’ vibration invades her solitude, driven by her agency to "outlast" the hush.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of Earthrise above dead moon offers non-literal answer to "last photograph" premise, reweighting "dawning hush" as sacred silence lost—thematic resonance emerges purely from concrete action, zero moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless ("stars impossibly sharp," "click absorbed by vacuum"); rhythm modulates from meditative to taut as sand dissolves, with compression taught early through sensory selectivity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Slight density dip in middle ("Her mind wandered...") with near-synonym loops ("desolate, magnificent," "sharp shadows and brilliant highlights"); otherwise, propulsion and specificity (geiger-camera’s "faint radioactive signature") elevate closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elegiac space exploration via chemical timer mechanic; emotional truth in "last watchman" archetype avoids cliché through irreplaceable details (nightwatch’s sand grain, radioactive film), risking quiet closure without gimmickry.</comment>
