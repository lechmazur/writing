<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion (Leo’s tear, throat touch) but "tight shell of fear" borders on label-only feeling. Contradictory impulses (fear/curiosity) act simultaneously during eclipse, yet motivation relies slightly on therapy-speak ("nurture lifelong wonder"). Final smile earns change with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure is Earned Stasis (Leo’s fragile smile, hand placement foreclosing grief path) with felt cost, but the eclipse-triggered magic feels coincidental under Accumulative lens. Non-closure accumulation: two issues (convenient magic resolution, shallow cost development) → -1.5 cap. Orientation clear by 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sage Ridge oaks and river stone constrain choices (stone hum activates curl), charging the final image. Sensory details (violet twilight, gossamer note) are selective and POV-filtered. Micro-setting (vial/hair curl) charges closure but environment doesn’t shape early tactics enough for 9+ band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wonder vs. grief) tightens via eclipse cadence shift, narrowing Leo’s options to engagement or retreat. Pressure grows through sensory accumulation, but the magic resolution leans on coincidence rather than Silas’s agency. Cost (vulnerability) is felt but not deepened through struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (curl’s note, river stone hum), avoiding moralizing. Final image ("ordinary world full of extraordinary song") reweights wonder without stating a moral. Slight thematic echo in "lifelong wonder" motivation limits resonance; epiphany risks sentimentality without deeper cost exploration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (Silas notices "rhythm of rain," "melody of stream") with rhythmic control during eclipse. Voice modulates perfectly under pressure—lyrical but never purple. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during the hum/curl resonance. Elision of Leo’s backstory taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong propulsion but "gossamer," "internal fire," and "premature, violet twilight" drift into elevated diction during peak beats. No loops or scaffold, yet "extraordinary song" final line risks sentimentality. Information density high, but register inconsistency in climax (-0.4) prevents 8.0+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope through "ordinary magic" specificity (river stone hum, hair curl resonance). Fresh inflection: eclipse as "crack in the ordinary" enabling wonder. Avoids safety middle with bold magic realism, but derivative premise guardrail applies—concept resembles common therapeutic archetypes without sufficient transformation.</comment>
