<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak; grief embodied in wool-sweater texture and sigh. Contradictory impulses (clinical precision vs. emotional risk) drive final choice. Dissolving thread manifests visible cost without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: Arthur’s "violent catharsis" and thread dissolution crystallize re-established connection. Accumulative lens holds—density of woven memories tightens into irreversible emotional transformation by the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gallery illusions (staircase abyss, advancing pillars) actively constrain Elara’s weaving tactics. Final image of "echoing quiet" recharges the setting’s "unsettling calm" with earned weight, proving environment charges closure per 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens: emotional density builds through woven memories until Arthur’s recognition forces irreversible catharsis. Cost is unmistakable (thread dissolution, overwhelming sensation), though pressure could feel more inevitable under extreme length constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete action: "texture of connection" resolves not as moral but as the "complex, beautiful pattern itself." Final image reweights premise without abstraction—no thematic echo, only earned resonance from wool-sweater specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: architect’s precision ("line of code in cognitive program") merges with sensory richness ("prismatic glimmers"). Rhythm modulates under pressure—short, taut sentences during weaving yield to fluid catharsis. Zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fracturing light into prismatic glimmers" does triple duty (image, metaphor, plot). Peak-beat prose stays clear ("felt the specific texture of her favorite wool sweater") with no figurative muddle. Final line recharges "texture" motif flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via "rational enchantment"—clinical precision heightens emotional risk. "Realistically imaginary" isn’t label but lived aesthetic. Risk-taking (weaving nightmares as therapy) feels inevitable, not gimmicky, passing transformation test decisively.</comment>
