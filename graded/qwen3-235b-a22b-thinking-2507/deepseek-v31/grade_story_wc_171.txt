<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices (trembling fingers tracing ebony swirl) but "flawed beauty" risks abstraction; the soldier's ghost haunts every checkmark with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with crystalline cost ("price paid in agonizing work") under Accumulative/Textural lens; celestial motif reprise charges the final image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ebony clipboard functions as micro-setting—constraining choices via ritual focus and charging the final notation; night-blooming vines' sweetness contrasts ash-choked memories with purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>Stakes deepen through Elara’s endurance (not decision), narrowing options to stillness; cost is felt in the hand-steadying micro-choice, though war’s scale lacks tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Redemption was a ledger of pain" earns resonance through soldier’s ghost and final notation; avoids moralizing by letting the clipboard’s grain embody the theme’s weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("syrupy time," "whispering robes") sustains under pressure; rhythmic control falters slightly in "flawed beauty" abstraction during climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; "ash-choked cries" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor register drift in "operatively gentle" (corporate diction) slightly dulls peak-beat immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms peace-negotiation trope via ritualized stillness as weapon; "muster the courage not to fight" synthesizes conflict with fresh emotional logic without gimmickry.</comment>
