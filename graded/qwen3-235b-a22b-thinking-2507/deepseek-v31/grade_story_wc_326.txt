<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in "cage/anchor" heartbeat duality, but emotional progression leans abstract ("diffuse ache") without sufficient embodied contradiction during high-stakes ink work; final endurance lacks visible micro-choice hierarchy shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands decisively: "continued her work" crystallizes refusal with palpable cost ("porcelain bit into her palm"), fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens through heartbeat density and ink-pattern accumulation; orientation flawless within 80 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: porcelain shard constrains choices (tracing ink) and charges closure (biting palm), while heartbeat counting narrows perception to tactile urgency; snow's silence actively enables the counting ritual's pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens: Julian's "static agony" deepens cost with each memory alignment, narrowing Elara's options to painful persistence; agency clear in shard-guided choices, but secondary stake (her borrowed time) lacks on-page pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "fetch wisdom from failure" reweighted by final image of bleeding persistence, avoiding moralizing; "borrowed time" gains conceptual cost through Julian's glitching, but wisdom's nature remains slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: heartbeat rhythm shapes syntax ("One hundred twelve thousand..."), cold air mists breath, and ink-swirl focus reflects her narrowed world; zero POV leakage even during Julian's dialogue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion flawless except "diffuse ache in her soul" borders on therapy-speak, instantly redeemed by concrete "porcelain bit into her palm"; no loops or scaffold, with rhythm accelerating during memory alignment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Digital ghost via inkblot transforms cliché through tactile specificity ("mosaic while wearing thick gloves"); emotional truth in "put back together all wrong" avoids abstraction, but observatory's "opal" feels underutilized.</comment>
