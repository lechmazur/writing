<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "eerie nostalgia" borders on label but stays embodied. Micro-choices absent under pressure despite fatigue and fear. Final endurance earned by prior causality with visible cost in slumped shoulders and tempered nostalgia.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "true silence" crystallizes options with cost in lingering nostalgia. Accumulative lens holds—mist lattice density increase reweights stakes. Dewdrops reprise makes cost legible via "gentle rain" after final note.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Grotto acoustics constrain choice (negative space method) and charge finale—dewdrops' reprise as "gentle rain" transforms opening vulnerability into earned renewal. Prism atrium functions as micro-setting that literally refracts conflict. No generic placeholder details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes viscerally felt from "slow, chilling end" to prophecy's "frantic" whisper.

Cost undeniable in fatigue and "bittersweet companion" nostalgia that charges the final packing ritual.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: musical specificity ("vaporous veil," "brass cool against lip").

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "bead of sweat" paragraph achieves high density. Minor deduction for "profound eerie nostalgia" bordering on label, but saved by physical anchoring. Final line’s "true silence" recharges opening with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Negative space method transforms prophecy trope through musical negation. Prism atrium avoids cliché via functional role.
