<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara's frozen dilemma between oath and prevention, but the sudden belief in prophecy's power lacks sufficient motivation buildup from her established traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure lands perfectly with visceral cost in "the cold wax cylinder gripped tightly," under Accumulative/Textural lens; early anchors and causal escalation via cylinder flaw create undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The wax cylinder's physicality constrains every choice, charging the final image; orchard setting's eternal blossoms actively contrast the "final exhalation" prophecy with devastating thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency (shaving cylinder → hearing prophecy → attempting destruction), but prophecy mechanics feel unearned despite high emotional cost in the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Final image reweights "velvet disquiet" into suspense through concrete action (frozen choice), avoiding moralizing; theme emerges from the orchard's eternal life versus the prophecy's finality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("taste of chalk dust and wonder," "scent of petrichor") modulates perfectly under pressure; rhythmic control in climax ("She had to unmake what she had made") heightens tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("latent loneliness of the soil" does triple duty) though "velvet disquiet" risks cliché repetition in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Wax cylinder transforms trope into indispensable engine; bold risk-taking in quiet climax pays off through specific emotional logic rather than gimmickry.</comment>
