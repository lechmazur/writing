<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "calm fire" motivation versus physical exhaustion; embodied emotion in "arm aching, breath ragged" shows cost. Lacks micro-choices beyond mallet use, slightly limiting character depth under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly with "orchard safe/buoyant" vs. "arm aching" cost. Accumulative lens clear by "fractal generating core" midpoint; pressure builds through sonic density without causality breaks. Orientation anchors by word 40.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Driftwood circle actively constrains choices during storm heave; bone mallet charges final image. Blue hour setting lacks tactile integration during climax—wind/salt spray described but not how they alter Kaelen’s grip or footing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (orchard survival) tightens through Kaelen’s agency: dubbing transforms destructive energy into harmony. Cost is visceral in "arm aching, breath ragged gasps" after storm passes. Escalation driven purely by protagonist’s sonic choices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "dubbing storm’s fury" becomes "instrument of perpetual transformation" without moralizing. Final image reweights "obstacles into instruments" via bone mallet’s earned significance—no thematic echo or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in cloud interpretation ("sketched resonance of world’s deep music"). Rhythm modulates flawlessly: short phrases during storm ("wind began to keen") versus lyrical calm post-crescendo. Zero POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose propulsion excels with "mallet a blur" kinetic phrasing. Minor deduction for "restless euphony" repetition (words 112/287) without significant evolution—slight loop in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "fractal" storm mechanics fused with dub music concept avoids template tropes. Bone mallet’s leviathan origin grounds abstraction; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry (e.g., "sonorous wood" as active resource).</comment>
