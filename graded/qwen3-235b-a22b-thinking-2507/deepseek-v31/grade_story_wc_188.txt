<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine: quiet efficiency vs. fierce joy upon seeing 'RISE'. Motivation rooted in embodied details (powder-stained fingers, rag knot), not abstract hope. Final choice earned through prior causality—mosaic discovery transforms preparation into 'conversation with history'—with visible cost in people's posture shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is Charged Poise: 'postures no longer slumped' crystallizes reconfigured stakes with felt cost. Accumulative lens holds—density escalates from 'low hum' to 'crimson sparks' tracing RISE. Cost proof: 'weight was not gone, but they remembered they could bear it' makes consequence undeniable on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Kerosene rag functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (blowing ember to ignite fuse) and charging the final image (pocketed 'warm' rag). Stone petals and mosaic aren't backdrop—they pressure Sparrow's mission, with 'RISE' literally reshaping the courtyard floor during climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defying hopelessness) tightens when mosaic discovery shifts Sparrow's 'hum to chemical chants', driving agency. Cost is visible in the people's physical transformation—'jolted, looking up as one' to 'postures no longer slumped'—reweighting despair through Sparrow's actions under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through 'RISE' mosaic → ignited word without moralizing. Final image ('brighter silence') reweights hope as endurance, not victory, avoiding sentimentality. No thematic echo—insight arises from concrete particulars (crimson sparks tracing letters), not abstract assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: Sparrow notices 'chemical compositions' not emotions. Rhythm modulates perfectly—from 'low rhythmic hum' to 'whistle scream'—with stress compressing diction ('thump felt more than heard'). Zero head-hopping; voice stays anchored in pyrotechnician's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; every line advances momentum (e.g., 'kerosene rag was his pen, pungent smell the ink' does triple duty). High-density prose avoids figurative muddle even in peak beats ('plume of crimson sparks erupted... setting RISE ablaze'). Final line ('brighter silence') crystallizes closure without cliché.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms 'rebel artist' trope through 'serious playfulness' framing. Fresh inflection: ground-level mine tracing RISE letters. Avoids safety middle—risks quiet ending where people don't cheer but simply rise. Specific detail ('copper oxychloride') grounds universality in lived craft.</comment>
