<question>1</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (skepticism vs recognition shudder) drive the memory flood; final choice to carry grief as "sea to sail" earned through visceral embodiment like teeth vibrating with harmonic thrum. Minimal abstraction in "grief was not a prison" avoids therapy-speak by grounding in dawn-light imagery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: shell dimming after "Live for both of us" crystallizes the price of remembrance. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—memory quarantine breaking via resonance density, not causal steps. Orientation nailed by "dusk" and "keeper" in opening line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Velvet Garden functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: "petals holding light instead of swallowing it" reweights Elara's relationship to memory. Soil "drinking light" and shell's phosphorescence constrain her choices from discovery to Archive placement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency—Elara's choice to place the shell triggers the memory flood. Cost is unmistakable: "isolation was not independence—it was a life half-lived." Dawn timing forces crystallization; coincidence (shell discovery) complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Final image—"radiant past she now carried without fear"—reweights memory as "sea to learn to sail" without stating morals. Theme emerges through shell's "doomed light" transforming into dawn-softened history, avoiding sentimentality via concrete stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: gardener's tactile focus ("blossoms that felt like skin," "hands could prune"). Rhythmic control under pressure shifts from staccato memory ("The storm, the crash") to flowing resolution. Zero head-hopping; voice modulates with "ghostly resolve" tonal shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "a shudder of recognition, deep and unwelcome" does triple duty advancing plot/emotion/theme. Minor density dip in "tapestry of silent witnesses" avoids overwriting by serving the harmonic thrum's buildup. Final line crystallizes closure without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Transforms amnesia trope via garden-as-metaphor ("soil that drank light") and resonance mechanics. Emotional specificity in brother's "laugh stolen by the gale" avoids generic loss. Risk-taking (lyric memory flood) heightens stakes while maintaining causal integrity through the shell's physicality.</comment>
