<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("dull ache of destined mismatch") and embodied emotion anchor the epiphany; micro-choices (crumbling ash) earn closure. Slight risk of over-articulated insight in "persistent gentle nurture" but redeemed by concrete vine parallels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost (ash as "compost for present"). Orientation clear by line 3. Reflection block (25%) slightly exceeds BRR cap but alters present stance via crumble choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Amber pavilion and gnarled vines constrain choice (refuge/reflection site) and charge closure (ash carried by "breeze that smelled of earth"). Micro-setting functions as essential pressure point for thematic integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconciling past love with land devotion) tightens via parallel-drawing method; agency crystallizes in crumble choice. Cost (transformed "always") legible in final image. One tightening suffices for length but reflection dominates escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through vine/love parallels ("fire isolated 'always'"), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "always" as commitment to land without stating thesis. "Some loves prepare" resonates as earned wisdom from concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct ("vines not beautiful classically; twists records of hardship"). Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity (short sentences at crumble moment). "Intersubjective understanding" slightly academic but voice-anchored by context.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("fragile paper... framed it by its own destruction"). "Passionate subtlety" risks overwriting but redeemed by root metaphor. Final line’s "expansive understanding" charges closure without dilution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms breakup trope via ecosystem metaphor ("clash of ecosystems"). Emotional specificity in "droughts and storms" producing sweetest fruit avoids genericity. Risk-taking (quiet closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
