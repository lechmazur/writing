<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses (observer/participant) act simultaneously during consecration; final choice earns closure via prior causality with visible cost in her role shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens; cost ("no longer about observation but participation") legible in consecration beat with persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
