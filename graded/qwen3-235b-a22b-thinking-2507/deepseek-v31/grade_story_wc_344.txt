<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elian's misreading of the oil vial as mere lubrication, then his cold-numbed realization it holds eclipse moonlight. Final choice to uncap it earns the closure through embodied struggle, not epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: the library's sigh and warming air manifest conceptual cost of mending time's fracture. Accumulative lens holds through sensory pressure buildup to the vial's uncapping, with cost legible in "driftwood nostalgia" shifting from loss to memory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Frozen library constrains every choice—the frost filigree numbs fingers, crystalline dust foreshadows the moonlight vial. Final image of "soft gold light bleeding through icy windows" charges closure by transforming the setting's physical state with visible cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through tactile failure: mismatched gears multiply in mirrors while cold-numbed fingers struggle with the vial. Escalation peaks when "uncap" redefines the solution, but the cost ("air warming just a degree") feels slightly underweighted for the global fracture premise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges invisibly: "rhythm of repair" crystallizes not in moral but in the gear's moon-shadowed teeth syncing with time's hum. Final line avoids sentimentality by grounding wisdom in the settled "proper place" of memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless—Elian notices "cold paper and driftwood nostalgia," not generic cold. Voice modulates from "shuddering elevator" tension to the resonant "gentle, resonant hum" of closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; every phrase propels: "crystalline dust" → "sliver of moonlight" creates causal texture. Final paragraph’s "sighed"/"warming"/"bleed" verbs form a breath-like rhythm that embodies the repaired "rhythm" without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms locksmith trope through specific constraints: lunar-eclipse timing matters only because the vial holds captured eclipse light. Frozen library’s physical logic (ice thawing to clarity, not melting) creates organic, non-gimmicky stakes.</comment>
