<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority shows concrete contradiction (scholarly charm vs silent defiance), but "spark of defiance" remains abstract label without embodied cost until climax. Micro-choices like decoding kale-squash-rosemary reveal values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: language rendered "invisible" via gourd's conceptual static. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through pattern-breaking escalation (decoded warning → reality warp), with cognitive meters' death as legible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Greenhouse functions as micro-setting that charges final image: beetles' symphonic response and bleeding flower colors constrain the reality-warping act. Gourd rattle's physicality ("familiar weight") enables the climax's tactile immediacy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: decoding the warning forces the gourd ritual. Conceptual cost (language's erasure) is legible in agents' confusion, but pressure lacks one visible pre-climax trade-off like sacrificing a garden bed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "candidly cryptic" language becomes "converging chaos" without moralizing. Final image reweights rebellion as wild growth, avoiding binaries while embracing complexity through gourd's transformed purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in horticultural lexicon ("spiraling patch of thyme," "seed patterns encoding phrases"). Voice modulates perfectly under pressure: clipped decoding ("kale, then squash, then rosemary") precedes lyrical climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "brass gears whirring as they tallied the cost" exemplifies high-density prose. Slight register drift in "conceptual energy" (para 5) risks abstraction but is anchored by gourd's physicality in same beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms dystopian trope through botanist-coded resistance: gourd rattle as weapon feels inevitable. Risk-taking heightens stakes via Accumulative lens—no confrontation, just a shake that rewrites reality's rules with emotional specificity.</comment>
