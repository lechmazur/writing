<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion ("basket heavy with frayed rope and resolve") and micro-choices (sewing air instead of cloth), but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; optimism remains consistent rather than conflicted under pressure. Final choice earns closure through prior causality, yet flaw depth stays surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: overwritten murals signify lost hubris, basin's transformation embodies the sea's return. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—quartz veins deepen pattern until tide validates the path. Orientation clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Red canyon walls function as micro-setting that actively constrains choices (etching quartz veins) and charges closure (water cascading down gleaming threads). Final luminous basin reweights the opening "sharp and thin" air, fulfilling the 9+ gate through environmental pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early ("old ways were the very precedents now broken") and escalate through accumulation: each night's sewing deepens the quartz pattern, narrowing options toward basin transformation. Cost is visceral in overwritten murals and the basin's rebirth, driven purely by Thea's agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action ("mending the story of her people" by tracing new quartz veins), not statement. Final "luminous, perfectly still pool" offers non-literal answer to "path from ruin to reverence," reweighting the shattered village without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality through concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bone-white moon," "orchid solace") and rhythmic control under pressure; lexicon stays within Thea's wharf-weaver voice ("frayed rope," "whalebone needle"). Purposeful compression taught early pays off in closure’s "labyrinth remembered" resonance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "pearlescent light" and "water-veined paths" show textural specificity. Final line recharges the opening tide pools with conceptual density. Minor generic phrasing ("barren stone basin") redeemed by etched channels' immediate payoff, avoiding closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms labyrinth trope through specific, grounded choices: sewing air as world-building method, quartz veins as tangible humility. Emotional truth in "hauntingly optimistic" avoids templates. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, meeting 9+ synthesis test.</comment>
