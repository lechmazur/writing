<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation for decoding leaves is concrete and drives micro-choices (shrine-building), but "profound need to honor" edges toward abstract labeling without full embodiment during the pivotal act.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost (Aisling's transformation), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through the shrine-building beat that crystallizes stakes—though "river of light" slightly obscures causality in the climax beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Arbor’s violet dusk setting actively constrains choices (sorting only during hush), and the moonstone speck’s foreignness charges the final image—eyes holding "luminescence of moonstone and heartwood" reweights the entire ecology.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen meaningfully through Aisling’s shrine-building choice, which narrows options by honoring the speck; cost is her irreversible transformation, though the revelation’s speed slightly softens the pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance emerges through shrines and decoded leaves without moralizing; the final "mossy delight" smile reweights the opening’s quiet work into earned wisdom about active listening versus passive sorting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mossy delight," "slate-grey seeds") modulates under pressure, but "sensation not of touch, but of understanding" introduces filter-verb abstraction that dilutes immediacy at the inciting moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops and high density, yet "rewiring her very being" is near-thesaurus churn that slightly muddles the transformation beat—minor artifact in peak pressure prevents 9.0 despite otherwise crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of library/tree mythology avoids derivative tropes; the risk of quiet climax (no confrontation) heightens stakes through specificity (seed sorting ritual), making the transformation feel inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
