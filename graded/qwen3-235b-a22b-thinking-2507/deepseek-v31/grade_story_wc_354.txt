<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's exile-driven motivation and contradictory impulses (stubborn morality vs. strategic precision) manifest concretely in his stone-gripping ritual and humming counter-frequency. The cartographer’s silent tapping as celestial notation reveals embodied trauma without diagnostic labels, though the sister remains a functional plot device rather than a fully realized character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: the cartographer’s shuddering breath crystallizes options after Kael’s humming aligns with the Nexus phase shift. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pressure intensifies via sensory density (spire resonance, metal filings stirring) until the finger-tap notation forces a reconfiguration of silence into language.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The basalt stone’s dent evolves from anxiety token to "record of battle," while the Nexus’s magnetic physics actively constrains Kael’s humming solution. Metal filings in coat seams and celestial coordinate tapping demonstrate setting as tactical resource, not backdrop—environment charges the final image when the stone’s dent reflects a "battle finally won."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the Nexus’s phase shift deadline, narrowing Kael’s options to humming before pathways lock. His agency drives the deepening: correlating silence with the brother’s tapping reweights the dominant stake (healing vs. exile) with visible cost—the stone’s dent becoming a physical testament to his "silent war" victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "beauty was the move that healed the board" crystallizes organically from the cartographer’s tapping star chart, not abstraction. Avoids moralizing by having Kael’s "terrible, beautiful truth" arise from translating cosmic terror, though the covenant backstory slightly edges toward binary "wisdom vs. victory" framing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kael’s strategist voice shines via precise diction ("thoughtfully precise," "measured before release") and sensory selectivity (ignoring sister to study the cartographer’s finger). Minor dip in "hopeful melancholy" abstraction weakens showing, but rhythmic control under pressure—humming counter-frequencies as tactical action—delivers distinct perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density where "metal filings in old coat seams stir" does triple duty (setting, character, stakes). Minor scaffold in "a ghost that walked beside him" slightly dulls immediacy, but propulsion remains relentless: "He did not speak to him. Instead..." accelerates toward the tapping climax without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "healing silence" tropes via hard sci-fi resonance physics—tapping as celestial notation feels inevitable yet fresh. Bold risk crystallizing climax on a finger twitch, not dialogue, heightens stakes through specificity (coordinates as rhythm) while avoiding sentimentality in the "terrible, beautiful truth" resolution.</comment>
