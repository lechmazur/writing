<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation ("hush dissonance of old guilt") drives micro-choices like prying the escritoire and guiding the needle with embodied tension ("dissonance in her mind swelled"). Contradictory impulses—erasure vs. integration—climax in binding the ghost, earning the closure through grandmother’s method. Avoids diagnostic labels via tactile resonance work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost: "silence was different... not absence, but whole presence" crystallizes the reconfigured stakes. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sound layer (glitch, baby cries, lullaby) intensifies pressure toward the binding. Cost proof: "ghost was not exorcised; it was laid to rest" makes conceptual price undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Copper disc and amber constrain choices and charge the final image—Elara places the "new fixed star" among others, transforming silence from void to tapestry. Sensory details ("spider-webbed wires humming latent energy") filter through her sonic obsession, with crisis narrowing focus to the needle’s precision. Micro-setting drives closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when the glitch invades as her own broken-promise voice, escalating pressure via sonic invasion rather than external force. Agency shines in her binding method—using amber-translated cries to weave with guilt—foreclosing erasure for integration. Cost is visceral: permanent transformation of dissonance into "hushed harmony."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sonic binding as non-literal answer to guilt’s persistence ("not erased... but bound"). Avoids moralizing via concrete action (copper etching), but "primal comfort" risks abstraction. Final image reweights "silence" from emptiness to wholeness without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: sound-centric noticing ("latent energy" in wires, "digital glitch" as haunting). Rhythmic control under pressure—"meteor hush of deep night"—compresses cosmic dread. Purposeful elision (grandmother’s theory) taught early and paid off in the escritoire discovery. Zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "braid together" and "tether" deepen meaning without redundancy. High density: "spider-webbed wires humming latent energy" conveys setting, theme, and tension. Final line’s "peaceful" silence recharges earlier motifs with earned cadence. No figurative muddle in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of guilt as sonic dissonance transformed through resonance physics. Bold risk: "constellation tattooist" mapping sound onto copper feels inevitable. Avoids tropes via specific mechanics (amber translating cries) and emotional truth in binding vs. erasure. Authentic voice elevates the premise.</comment>
