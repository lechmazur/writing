<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: "not to remember, but to reply" crystallizes her drive. Micro-choices (bow still, bowl over violin) reveal hierarchy of values. Final listening choice earned through acoustic causality, with visible cost in "heartbreaking chorus" reweighting grief as grace.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "bow still, having finally found... conversation" crystallizes options with felt cost in "heartbreaking chorus." Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation. Cost proof evident in grief-to-grace transformation reconfiguring the chronic hush.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse functions as active acoustic chamber constraining the climax: water amplifies vibration, glass resonates. Bowl's floating presence charges the final image ("collecting and clarifying"). Micro-setting (moss-slick bench, rusting dome) directly shapes her ritual tactics with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stake crystallization: "chronic hush is not empty" deepens knowledge under Accumulative lens. Single-note action narrows options to unbinding echoes, with cost legible in "heartbreaking chorus." Agency drives escalation—her choice to play reconfigures silence into conversation with undeniable emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "turning grief into a kind of grace" reweights beauty-in-fragments without moralizing. Final "conversation" image answers the central question through sonic resonance, avoiding sentimentality while embracing complexity in the layered echoes. No thematic echo detected.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: acoustic focus ("acoustical texture," "frequency") filters all observation. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short sentences during ritual ("She placed the bowl..."). Elision of backstory taught early via "ghosts now" and pays off in her need to reply, enhancing tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "salt-tolerant fruits grew wild and strange" exemplifies textural specificity. Final beat clean: "bow still, having finally found... conversation" avoids figurative muddle. Propulsion through concrete verbs ("waded," "slipped," "vibrated") maintains momentum without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic trope through acoustic lens: "chronic hush" as tangible texture feels inevitable. Bowl tradition subverts mendicant expectations while serving emotional stakes. Risk-taking (sound as protagonist) heightens coherence without gimmickry, synthesizing loss and resonance memorably.</comment>
