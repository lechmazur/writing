<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in temptation/resistance moment; "warlike serenity" concept slightly abstract early but redeemed by embodied closure choice. Flaw: minor delay in showing her "finds lost things" trait actively shaping a micro-choice under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost ("hand numb"); causal chain from failure to frozen seed is airtight. Lens (Causal) named by midpoint via ritual mechanics and held through crystallized refusal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Obsidian seed functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (burning palm) and charges final image (rime-encased confession). Orchards-in-water finale perfectly reweights setting’s meaning with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: failed ritual → seed’s bargain → crystallized refusal. Cost is unmistakable in physical pain transforming to numbness, reconfiguring "containment" as active endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete action: showing growth "without consumption" reframes "mirrors don’t show" into holding monsters without becoming one. Zero moralizing; final line resonates as earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "psychic pull" and bark-petal imagery; rhythm fractures under vortex’s gale then steadies with circles. Zero head-hopping; stress compresses syntax without losing voice specificity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "frosted over, its pulsing light snuffing out" achieves triple duty. Minor deduction: "warlike serenity" borders abstraction early but compensated by later embodied crystallization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "contain evil" trope via specific moral calculus: refusal as active containment. Risk-taking in quiet climax (no battle, just frozen endurance) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
