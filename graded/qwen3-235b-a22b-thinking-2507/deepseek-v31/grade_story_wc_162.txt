<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in key beats; Elara’s "featherly determined" trait manifests concretely in wood-grain analysis but no genuine flaw complicates her choice. Final endurance (finding father) is earned yet feels streamlined without visible internal struggle during the threshold crossing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "she was alone... but no longer lost" crystallizes cost of gained understanding versus physical separation. Orientation anchors by word 15 ("Drifting Prism Terrace"), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density buildup to the memory superimposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Wood grain functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (deciphering the code) and charges closure ("code now a story"). Sensory details like "railings of solidified air" avoid white-room syndrome by tethering urgency to texture, making the Terrace an active pressure point.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when wood-grain analysis reveals the Butterfly Effect moment, narrowing Elara’s path to the sacred threshold. Cost is legible in closure—understanding the collapse but remaining separated from her father—though escalation relies heavily on one deepening beat rather than layered pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the wood-grain/weather-code parallel without moralizing; the final image reweights "necessary distances" as temporal echoes. Avoids false balance by framing the father’s obsession as both brilliant and isolating, with the monarch butterfly embodying "beautiful, terrible simplicity."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in texture-focused noticing ("paper crackling like a dry throat"), with rhythm modulating from lyrical description to compressed urgency during the memory sequence. Minor psychic-distance blur in "panicked voice that was already history" slightly undermines precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high-density prose like "deafening roar of wind and screaming metal" compresses sensory overload without muddle. Final line ("she had finally intuited the map") crystallizes theme with concrete specificity, avoiding abstraction or figurative clutter in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms the Butterfly Effect trope through the wood-grain weather code—a specific, grounded mechanism that avoids cliché. Emotional truth in Elara’s quiet determination versus the father’s sketching obsession creates freshness, though the "sacred thresholds" concept edges toward familiar resonance.</comment>
