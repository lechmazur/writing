<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Silas' non-combatant resourcefulness versus desperation; embodied fear during predator encounter avoids labels. Final endurance earned by prior causality but Elara's role lacks sufficient pressure on Silas' choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost—the predator's exclusion from nothingness sanctuary. Accumulative lens holds through silence-pattern escalation; cost legible in the "thrumbing potential" of empty shelves.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mountain setting actively constrains tactics: mycelial shelves and negative-space navigation dictate every move. Photosynthetic ink and heartwood chamber charge the final image, transforming environment into tactical necessity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through narrowing options—each gap chosen risks detection. Silas' agency in renegotiating existence via silence reweights survival cost; predator's hesitation crystallizes pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "syntax of silence" reframes wisdom as absence. Final image reweights "unlearned lessons" without moralizing, though slight thematic echo in "blessedly learned" risks sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels—linguist notices "gaps in Dewey Decimal" not book titles. Rhythmic control modulates under pressure: clipped phrases during clicks, lyrical flow in library. Zero dialogue artifacts despite dual characters.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding; "tense ballet" and "shimmering door" compress high-stakes action. Minor density risk in "melancholy composition of lost thoughts" but payoff in closure image prevents muddle. Propulsion flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistic theory and temporal horror: predator defeated by sonic voids, not weapons. Risk-taking in silence-as-sanctuary feels inevitable through prior pattern-building, elevating stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
