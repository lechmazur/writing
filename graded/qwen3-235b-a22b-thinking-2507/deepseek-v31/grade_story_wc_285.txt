<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Silas' embodied attentiveness drives choices (map stitching, waiting for drips), but lacks internal conflict beyond quiet focus; micro-choices like the blue thread stitch reveal value hierarchy without over-articulation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when dripping ceases—the cost of vigil's end legible in "silence that remained was whole and complete"; Accumulative lens holds through sensory tightening without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fog and river actively constrain waiting (e.g., "tendrils and sighs" revealing/hiding forest), while the yarn needle charges closure via map-stitching; micro-setting dictates the promise's fulfillment timing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake (keeping palimpsest promise) tightens via the gutter-drip countdown; agency manifests in endurance, not decision, with cost in the vigil's conclusion—elevated by the Accumulative lens' pressure accumulation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through map-as-palimpsest: "distill complexity into essence" dramatized by stitching blue thread, not stated; final image reweights the land's "essence" held within him without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("spindrift serenity," "woolen blanket" fog) filters all detail; rhythmic control peaks in the drip-to-silence shift, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "percolate" deepens twice with purpose; high density ("trembling lens" spiderwebs) without figurative muddle; final line’s "essence... held securely" crystallizes propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms waiting trope via coachman’s cartographic ritual; "palimpsest promise" and yarn needle inject fresh specificity, though risk-taking stops short of bold structural innovation.</comment>
