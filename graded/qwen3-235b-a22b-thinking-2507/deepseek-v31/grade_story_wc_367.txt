<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "shadowed elation" and shift from mockery to awe, but final choice lacks deeper conflict between solitude and influence. Glass wick interaction reveals character under pressure effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly: lens adjustment (cause) → beam physics (effect) → prophecy fulfillment (consequence). Charged Poise closure lands with visible cost in "cold realization" and renewed purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass wick functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (adjusting lens) and charges final image. Emerald lighthouse actively shapes climax through prism physics, meeting 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when jest becomes prophecy; agency drives escalation through lens adjustment. Cost is unmistakable in Silas' realization he "had touched the machinery of the world."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through prism physics mirroring unintended consequences. Final laugh offers resonant non-literal answer to central question without moralizing, fulfilling 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in technical details ("green-tinged prisms," beam physics) filtered through lighthouse keeper's expertise. Rhythmic control intensifies under storm pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "river of green fire" exemplifies high-density imagery. Minor register drift in "cosmic absurdity" slightly jars from Silas' voice but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse physics as fate mechanism. Emotional truth in fear/triumph mix avoids cliché, though political coup resolution edges toward convenience.</comment>
