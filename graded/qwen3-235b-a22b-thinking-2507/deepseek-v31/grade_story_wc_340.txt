<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority excels through embodied micro-choices (angling goggles, projecting light), but "affectionate detachment" label risks therapy-speak; cost is earned via stewardship versus command's sterile reception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "keeper of light" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (joy requires witnessing). Accumulative lens holds through light-pattern discovery to final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Goggles-as-setting constrain choice (light projection method) and charge closure ("quiet warmth"). Icebound spire enables cipher revelation—environment actively shapes tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's agency: deciphering joy becomes a live choice with cost (commander receives objects, not meaning). Pressure accumulates via lens/light mechanics, narrowing options to revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: encrypted joys reweight command's anguish. Final image ("joy now a quiet warmth") offers non-literal answer without moralizing—resonance via stewardship as sacred act.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("weak spire-light play across lenses") with rhythmic control. Minor register drift in "affectionate detachment" label; otherwise, compression taught early via elevator ascent intensifies pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold; "geometric key" avoids purple prose by serving mechanics. Slight overwriting in "faint, intricate pattern" but redeemed by payoff. Final line’s "journey forever changed" risks sentimentality yet charged by prior specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms servant trope through encrypted joy discovery. Fresh synthesis: grief refracted via stewardship’s quiet labor. Risk-taking (lyric decryption) heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity anchors universals in icebound spire.</comment>
