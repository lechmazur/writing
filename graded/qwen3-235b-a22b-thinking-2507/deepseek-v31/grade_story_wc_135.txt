<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "reactively visionary" insight lacks embodied struggle; exile pain surfaces but doesn't conflict with sudden conviction during memorial realization. Strong micro-choices otherwise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost in final brass-over-heart image, but memorial angle deduction lacks causal setup, weakening Accumulative lens cohesion at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ivory harbor puddles actively constrain choices (reflections for artifact placement) and charge final image; rain-slick stones shape tactile connection to past. Micro-setting as pressure point.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's speech triggering realization, but "deliberate interruption" accusation emerges without visible protagonist agency in the Accumulative escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment><comment>Theme crystallizes non-literally in brass-over-heart gesture—truth as tangible, not abstract—avoiding moralizing while reweighting exile and silence with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("salt-tang as familiar ghost," "emptiness as chart") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control in fragmented sentences during revelation beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in climax, but "hearten the frightened populace" summary (not scene) dulls momentum; minor lexicon drift ("reactively visionary" label vs embodied struggle).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archivist-as-rebel using physical fragments; risk-taking in Accumulative truth-revelation lands without gimmickry, though memorial deduction feels undercooked.</comment>
