<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "fierce repose" duality and hands trembling with resolve not anxiety; embodied cost of "weight in his chest" gone after self-forgiveness earned through strategic action avoids therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visible cost ("weight... gone") under Accumulative/Textural lens; the plinth insertion's click and shattering stasis reconfigure stakes through patterned escalation without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen dewdrops shivering at the climax charge the final image; the platinum labyrinth and tapestry border constrain Kael's decoding choices throughout, transforming micro-setting into essential pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of self-forgiveness tightens through Kael's decoding agency; the unraveling thread forces trade-offs (ignoring vs. pursuing the flaw) with cost legible in his decade-long anguish lifting only after action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "mending a thread" as non-literal answer to self-forgiveness; avoids moralizing by showing redemption via strategic skill rather than abstract declaration in the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "woven hush" and "gelid stasis" reflects Kael's strategic mind; rhythmic control peaks in the thunder's "deep and lazy percussion" escalating to the clean crack that shatters stasis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "platinum labyrinth felt warm in his palm" exemplifies high-density prose doing triple duty (sensory, emotional, thematic) without figurative muddle in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess strategy applied to tapestry decoding transforms exile tropes; risk-taking in "woven hush" as tangible constraint—not just theme—heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
