<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in micro-choices (corking vial vs. doubt pooling) but emotional progression lacks irrationality—doubt resolves too neatly without layered hypocrisy under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: "whispers cross oceans" crystallizes with visceral cost (kneeling exhaustion, spent cork). Accumulative lens holds via sensory density, though coincidence slightly weakens agency in resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cobalt lighthouse functions as micro-setting: gallery height and spiral stairs constrain movement, while vial scent charges the final image. "Screaming tenderness" phrasing slightly overwrites tactile urgency at climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (warning fleet) lacks protagonist-driven escalation; resolution hinges on coincidence rather than Elias’ tactics. Pressure accumulates texturally but doesn’t narrow options meaningfully under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through vial mechanics and Silas’ shouting failure. Final image ("monument to quieter care") reweights "whispers vs shouts" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo in closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("scent spoke of secrets") but "screaming tenderness" clashes with keeper’s lexicon—abstract phrasing dilutes voice during peak pressure despite rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops but "screaming tenderness" in climax: mixed metaphor + therapy-speak label dulls closure image. Otherwise high density with strong verbs; overwriting in one critical beat caps score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vibrations-of-intent concept transforms lighthouse trope through scent mechanics. Emotional specificity elevates familiar arc, though "prove whispers travel farther" motivation edges toward template without deeper moral ambiguity.</comment>
