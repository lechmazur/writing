<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (fear vs artistic purpose) manifest in thread selection; final choice earned through embodied micro-choices like discarding the portrait failure thread. Slight abstraction in "spiraling dread" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "discarding the burdens that weighted her" crystallizes the transformation. Accumulative lens holds perfectly as reality fragmentation intensifies toward the final beam of light.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lighthouse library functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (no stairs, must use threads) and charges the final image—the beam becomes her artistic tool. Dust and mercury substance evolve causally with the pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: Elara’s realization that she must "navigate" chaos (not fight it) forces the thread-selection trade-off. Cost is unmistakable when she discards the sorrowful portrait thread during descent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the "luminescent ache" shifts from crushing pain to artistic tool in the final image, offering a resonant answer to "how to see truth" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite near-explicit final line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("artist’s fingers... tracing contours"), with rhythmic control under pressure (fragmented syntax during reality bleed). Minor abstraction in "hollow echo" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion but a density issue in high-pressure beat: "pain both beautiful and terrible, the light of a dying star" slightly overwrites without pattern payoff. No closure impact, but prevents 8.8+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of artistic process and reality fragmentation feels inevitable (threads as edited memories). Specific details like mercury-like substance transform tropes, though lighthouse metaphor has familiar echoes.</comment>
