<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in climax: "weapon that could shatter... reputation" vs "confession? burden?" drives authentic choice. Embodied emotion ("breath that felt like her first") avoids therapy-speak. Slight underdevelopment of solitude motivation prevents 9.5.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: incineration act reconfigures truth's meaning. Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly—rain, lens, doodles accumulate pressure until the hatch sighs open. No orientation debt; cost proof crystallized in "breath that felt like her first."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the projector lens constrains choice (magnifying doodles) and charges closure ("purer, kinder light"). Crystal forecourt evolves from "whispering" backdrop to active pressure point during incineration. Sensory details filtered through Anya’s archivist bias ("dust motes" for text).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Anya’s agency: "discrepancy" → "cryptic doodles" → "weapon" escalates moral vise. Cost is unmistakable in the incineration’s physicality ("breath that felt like her first"). Fits Accumulative lens perfectly—no causal shortcuts, pressure grows via discovery density.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "choosing mercy over fact" shown via incineration, not stated. Final image ("purer, kinder light") reweights truth non-literally. Avoids moralizing—complexity intact as "retired man’s reputation" lingers without redemption.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "resonant hush," "ambiguous starbursts," and "dust motes" reflect archivist’s precision. Syntax modulates under pressure—lyrical during discovery, clipped at climax ("She did not make a copy"). Zero POV leakage; focalization stays anchored in tactile detail.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythm purposefully ("crystalline panels... tiny percussion" vs "hatch sighing open"). Metaphors serve character ("lens... perfect metaphor for truth"). Peak beats avoid overwriting—"dust motes" shows textural specificity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: archivist’s solitude reframes truth as mercy, not weakness. Specific details (Orpheum logbook, projector lens) transform moral dilemma. Emotional complexity in "honesty of conscience" avoids generic templates. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
