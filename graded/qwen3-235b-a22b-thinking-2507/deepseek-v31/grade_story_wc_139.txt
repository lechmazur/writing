<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "rigid thinking began to liquefy" and clutch-purse action revealing value hierarchy shift. No therapy-speak; embodied grief replaces anger with "heavier, complex grief" carrying visible cost. Only minor deduction for slightly underdeveloped off-page father complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: walking to mourners crystallizes options with undeniable cost in "heavier grief, potent with deathly vitality." Accumulative lens holds; passport reveal reweights all prior stakes causally. Cost proof evident in final image’s conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mortuary prep room functions as micro-setting: sterile steel pressures the ink-pot breach, while "wilting lilies" anchor tone. Ink pot evolves from prop to truth-vessel, charging the final image as "just an object again" after reconfiguration. Environment constrains every choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconciling deception with sacrifice) tightens through internal deepening, not external pressure. Passport discovery narrows options by liquefying her worldview, with cost legible in "mathematics... tragically incomplete." Agency-driven under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment><comment>"Fair trade" metaphor evolves organically from calculation to recognizing "asylum he built for her," avoiding moralizing. Final line delivers non-literal thematic answer through concrete sacrifice, with "deathly vitality" reweighting the opening motif. No thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "refused to look at instruments directly" shows character-particular noticing. Rhythmic control shifts from clipped tension ("She reached for it") to lyrical reflection ("ocean of unspoken sacrifice"), with no head-hopping. Dialogue mechanics serve subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "liquefy" recurrence evolves meaning purposefully. High density: "brittle, folded map" conveys age and fragility in two words. Final line’s cadence ("only fair deal he ever made") charges closure without muddle. Minor deduction for one borderline stock phrase ("cloying scent").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms con-artist trope through specific emotional logic: deception reframed as survival tactics. "Deathly vitality" synthesizes setting and theme uniquely. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
