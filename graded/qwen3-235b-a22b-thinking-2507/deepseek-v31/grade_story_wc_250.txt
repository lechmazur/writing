<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>No internal conflict beyond steadfastness; empathy projection lacks embodied struggle. Final choice feels preordained rather than earned through contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost: darkness embracing stars reconfigures its nature. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—the density shift from unraveled patterns to star-weaving tightens the stake with palpable tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cobalt dock’s wet-stone atmosphere charges the final image, but "shattered sky" in puddles feels ornamental. Dental mirror as micro-setting constrains every action, directly shaping the star-weaving climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via protagonist’s agency—she shifts from reflecting light to projecting empathy—but darkness’s retreat lacks sufficient causal friction; the void’s hesitation feels convenient rather than earned through escalating cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: stars as companions in darkness, not conquerors. Final image of two shimmering skies offers resonant non-literal answer to "teaching darkness," avoiding moralizing while charging prior struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "spiralingly calm" syntax mirrors Elara’s grace. Voice modulates flawlessly from cobalt dock’s stillness to the void’s advance, with elision (darkness’s nature) taught early and paid off in the sigh of acceptance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "spiralingly calm" risks overwriting but gains texture through repetition. Final line’s "loom on which she wove compassion" achieves high density without muddle, though "formless sorrow" slightly drifts from concrete lexicon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms guardian trope through dental mirror’s specificity and darkness-as-companion framework. Emotional truth in solitude feels fresh, though star-weaving risks familiar lyricism; coherence elevates it beyond template.</comment>
