<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation crystallizes powerfully through embodied memories ("taste of sun-warmed apple"), but internal contradiction remains underdeveloped; preservation-to-restoration shift lacks visible friction in peak pressure moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "roots in the future/branches in past" reweights time with soil-covered hands as tangible sacrifice; Accumulative lens holds through memory-stitching climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: acorn cap constrains choice (planting helm) and charges final image ("rough, vital bark"); frozen soil's transformation into "soil that felt like hope" embodies stakes through tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias' memory-stitching agency under Accumulative lens; cost crystallizes in the atrium's rebirth, though vortex resistance lacks tangible trade-offs beyond willpower expenditure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "texture of borrowed time" resolves in bark's roughness, avoiding moralizing; final image reweights preservation as active restoration without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("scaled pattern a tiny map"), rhythmic control intensifies during vortex confrontation; no head-hopping despite lyrical compression taught early through seed-vial inscriptions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "reverse lightning strike of growth" exemplifies high-density propulsion; every phrase advances atmosphere or stakes without figurative muddle even in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seed-saving with entropy physics feels inevitable; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes, though "vortex inheritance" concept borders on familiar mythic tropes without sufficient transformation.</comment>
