<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses ("drowsy alertness") and embodied choices under pressure culminate in the valve turn, earning closure through causal motivation. Minor deduction as "reckless explorer" trait isn't tested until climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost ("weight settled firmly in her hands"). Causal lens holds perfectly; orientation is clear by word 20. Cost proof is concrete in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The valve wheel's texture and resistance constrain choices, charging the final image. Tunnel's "velvet silence" and gravel actively shape perception, though industrial specifics don't affect occupational tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake (uncovering truth) tightens through Elara's agency interpreting radio static. Cost is visceral in exhaustion and "metallic taste," though the radio's origin feels slightly coincidental.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the valve's physicality and "swallowed truth" metaphor. Final image reweights the premise, but thematic resonance lacks deeper constraint from setting beyond the valve.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("pale eye staring into damp throat") modulates under stress. Syntax compresses during panic ("cataloged every drip"), avoiding filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; "shriek that tore through whispers" demonstrates high density. Final line ("silent dark") crystallizes closure without figurative muddle. Propulsion never falters.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Talk-radio psychics as spirit medium" transforms ghost tropes. Valve's specificity ("beaded," "lacework of rust") makes it fresh, though the fire backstory leans familiar.</comment>
