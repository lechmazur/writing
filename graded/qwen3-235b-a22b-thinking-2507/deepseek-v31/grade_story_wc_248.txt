<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in the erasure sequence—love versus duty embodied in smudging charcoal—but lacks micro-stakes in the discovery beat; volcanic tenderness concept elevates motivation yet internal friction remains slightly abstract during the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost (erasing the trail) under Accumulative/Textural lens; the final image reweights the vandalized portrait’s meaning. Orientation anchors by line 3, and the "veil of ruin" crystallizes the reconfiguration without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The tapestry fragment and mineral pigments function as micro-setting, constraining choices (erasure tactics) and charging the final image. Sensory specificity—oxidized wine, petrified wood—filters through Elara’s analytical intuition, avoiding white-room syndrome while mirroring her internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara’s agency: creating the trail escalates risk, erasure forecloses revelation with tangible cost (swept pigments). The dominant stake—protecting vulnerability via ruin—deepens under Accumulative pressure, with the vandal’s wine-smear serving as a persistent constraint shaping her tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the vandalized portrait’s evolution: destruction as protection reweights the "forgotten promise" without moralizing. The final erasure offers non-literal answer—love as concealment—recharging "volcanic tenderness" through action, not abstraction, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("analytically intuitive") infuses every detail—geometric patterns, mineral textures—with rhythmic cadence shifts during high-pressure beats. No head-hopping; voice modulates from clinical ("fossilized libraries") to lyrical ("gentle, sleeping fire") without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in opening ("a ghost... to become a savior") slightly dulls propulsion, but zero loops elsewhere. Figurative language serves pressure ("lending library arsonist"), and the erasure sequence’s "charcoal smudged away; pigments swept into dust" achieves crystalline clarity with emotional weight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms archive tropes via "volcanic tenderness" and the erasure climax—a fresh inflection where rescue means re-concealment. The vandalized self-portrait’s specificity (wine-smear, rust-gold thread) avoids generality, synthesizing emotional truth with bold structural risk.</comment>
