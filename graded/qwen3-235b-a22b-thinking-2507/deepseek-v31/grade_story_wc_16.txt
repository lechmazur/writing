<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "cautious exuberance" and inkwell tilt, but Alaric's off-page status until climax limits relationship crucible. Final choice lacks visible cost escalation beyond emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("silence would become permanent" resolved through translation), but light refraction discovery edges toward coincidence despite motivated action. Lens (Accumulative) holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Glass inkwell constrains choice (refracting sigil) and charges final image, but archive setting remains atmospheric backdrop without altering tactics. Micro-setting succeeds where environment fails.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation via linguistic deepening ("tangled syntax" to "complex weave") driven by agency (tilting inkwell), with unmistakable conceptual cost in broken silence. Timeframe urgency lacks active clock pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image ("symphony they had built together said everything") reweights truth-as-vow without moralizing. Theme emerges from inkwell's flaw enabling clarity, avoiding thematic echo in closure beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("joyful, obsessive pursuit of meaning") modulates perfectly under pressure. Syntax mirrors linguistic focus ("interconnected promises... contextualized another") with rhythmic control in climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "heart hammered against her ribs" slightly clichéd but redeemed by immediate concrete action ("dipped her pen"). Final line achieves high density without muddle: "symphony... said everything" crystallizes theme.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of academic work as emotional crucible: "vow" sigil transforms linguistic method into relational pact. Risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry, rooted in character-specific details.</comment>
