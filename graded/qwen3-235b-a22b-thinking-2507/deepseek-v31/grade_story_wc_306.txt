<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via mirror shard handling and "protected vulnerability" phrasing, but diagnostic label risks deduction; client's crumbling face delivers embodied cost without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with visceral cost in "face crumbled... let shard fall" under Accumulative lens; wind chime escalation perfectly reweights stakes through sensory density shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse micro-setting charges closure: falling shard on stones mirrors client's collapse, while wind chimes evolve from anxious staccato to questioning scale to constrain Elara's final choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through mirror shard's rejection: "what do you want to see?" crystallizes moral calculus without moralizing; final image reweights "conscience for hire" as unsustainable performance.</comment>
