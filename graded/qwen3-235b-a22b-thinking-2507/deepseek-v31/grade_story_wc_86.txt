<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s "apology offered/forgiveness not deserved" tension and Kael’s "weary shame," but "emotional arithmetic" borders on therapy-speak. Micro-choices like placing the drawer pull down earn the closure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: leaving the drawer pull reconfigures the past with undeniable conceptual cost ("discarded key to a door closed forever"). Moon-phase mechanism underutilized but doesn’t break the Accumulative/Textural lens holding through the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The drawer pull functions as micro-setting, constraining choice (Kael’s nightly ritual) and charging the closure. Mist-thinned moonlight isn’t backdrop but active pressure; "rough-hewn wood" table makes the final gesture tactile and irreplaceable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when Kael’s token reveals shared ownership of the mistake, forcing Elara’s realization. But moon-phase synchronization doesn’t actively narrow options—it’s atmospheric timing, not protagonist-driven escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: the drawer pull’s evolution from "cold weight of confinement" to "discarded key" reweights "recycling mistakes" into earned release. No moralizing—final image’s conceptual cost ("door closed forever") answers the central question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: Elara notices tactile details (slick stones, numb hands) reflecting her thoughtful nature. "Emotional arithmetic" slightly drifts from POV lexicon, but rhythmic control in the closure beat ("Then we understand it... let it go") is masterful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Furrowed hush" repeats in para 1 (synonym loop), slightly dulling immediacy. Otherwise flawless propulsion: "tarnished brass, intricately carved" shows specificity; final line’s "mist began to thin" avoids overwriting while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms prisoner-exchange trope through the drawer pull’s psychological weight and the "untether" resolution. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, but moon-phase method feels conventional rather than freshly synthesized into the core conflict.</comment>
