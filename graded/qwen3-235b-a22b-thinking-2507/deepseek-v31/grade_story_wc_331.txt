<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "sanely eccentric" tension; embodied motivation ("holding a sigh") avoids therapy-speak. Final reawakening choice lacks visible cost escalation despite strong micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with felt cost ("unaccountable sense of wonder"), but hyperbolic geometry mechanics remain decorative rather than causal under Accumulative lens. Lens holds but missing one escalation beat narrows impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the scarf's "ozone" scent and mosaic's "breathing scales" constrain Elara's ritual, charging the final image. Sensory selection narrows under pressure without checklist overreach.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding story-origin) tightens through sensory deepening, but patron presence fails to apply secondary pressure. Cost ("reawakened her own story") feels earned though not viscerally paid on-page during climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through hyperbolic geometry as narrative metaphor; final image reweights "stories live" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite high-concept premise through concrete sensory accumulation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("melancholic mathematicians," "cocktail of distilled history") modulates perfectly with ritual intensity. Zero head-hopping; lyric compression taught early pays off in closure's shimmering air.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line propulsion flawless until "spiderweb vibrating with distant news" risks mixed metaphor. Minor scaffold ("soft-focused sculptures") prevents 9.0, but rhythm accelerates organically toward singularity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "finding story-origin" trope through scientific poetry fusion; hyperbolic geometry isn't gimmick but emotional calculus. Risk-taking heightens stakes without muddying closure's conceptual cost.</comment>
