<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction manifests physically in trembling hands holding the shell; embodied emotion avoids therapy-speak but the epiphany risks over-articulation ("understood the core concept") slightly diluting visceral impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: leaving the shell charges the final image with conceptual cost ("temporary eternity" made tangible), fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens through sensory reconfiguration without causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Coastal cave functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (squeezing through crevice, flashlight navigation) and charges closure via luminous pool/shell ritual; mineral veins and fungi directly enable the thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias' agency: wrong turn → crevice squeeze → shell discovery creates escalating pressure under Accumulative lens; cost is visceral in relinquishing the shell as physical manifestation of his fractured self.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (shell, mirror crack) avoiding moralizing; "temporary eternity" reweights nostalgia into active preservation, though final paragraph's conceptual phrasing slightly edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("air tasted of salt and ancient stone") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control peaks in cave sequence with purposeful compression ("He was a trespasser in time") taught early and paid at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold in peak beats; high density ("fracture spidering across his reflection" → "fracture between his two selves") but slight overwriting in quay description ("steeped in deep, aching nostalgia") costs 0.2.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "temporary eternity" through painter's lens avoids cliché; risk-taking (lyric structure, conceptual closure) heightens stakes coherently, though emotional resolution edges toward familiar epiphany terrain.</comment>
