<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in symphonic thinking enabling both isolation and insight; micro-choice of pocketing chrysalis reveals hope. Slight deduction as "translate separation into connection" motivation is stated not shown until late climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "connection was not the absence of separation" reconfigures meaning with grief's "loosened" cost felt in final image. Accumulative lens holds perfectly through foam observation buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Braided ravine actively constrains choice—river foam patterns directly enable the solution. Final image ("divergent path led through it") charges the setting with undeniable cost. Slight deduction for "weathered limestone" generality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (atone for toxin) tightens through Aris's agency observing foam, narrowing options from rigid cage to fluid process. Cost ("grief loosened") is felt not visible, just missing the 8.8+ visible-price threshold.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: chrysalis/foam motifs reweight "empty vessel" from loss to possibility without moralizing. Final line avoids thematic echo but "art of navigating separation" borders on abstraction, costing 0.3.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("deconstructed world into movements") with rhythmic control ("boots scraping... sinking into wet sand"). Filter-verb adjacency in "symphonically minded since childhood" prevents 9.1+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; "ephemeral sculptures" does triple duty. "Bitter separation into connection" slightly abstract in mid-beat costs 0.1. Final image ("empty vessel full of possibility") crystallizes with perfect propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "scientist inspired by nature" trope through polymer specificity and grief integration. Foam-filter insight feels earned, not gimmicky. Risk-taking (symphonic POV) heightens stakes without clarity loss.</comment>
