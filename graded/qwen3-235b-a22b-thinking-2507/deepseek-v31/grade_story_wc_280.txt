<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "refused to be a monument to tragedy" vs despair vortex; micro-choices like coin-turning under pressure earn closure. Slight deduction for ghostly abstraction limiting embodied pain specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: "phantom pain vanished" and "timeline snapped whole" show undeniable cost under Accumulative lens. Minor hairline slip in synesthesia logic ("violet sound") doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard actively constrains choices: "latent magic responded" and fruit absorbing music charges the final image. Tarot coin as micro-setting functions as environment, with worn smoothness shaping her anxiety.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's agency: layering echoes narrows options to weaving joy/sorrow. Cost is legible in vanished pain and timeline snapping, though transformation feels slightly effortless at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "weaving death into the larger tapestry," avoiding moralizing. Final curtain call with silver petals offers resonant non-literal answer to "art versus tragedy" without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in synesthetic phrasing ("cold taste of stage fright") modulates under pressure. Slight register drift in "violet sound" risks POV lexicon but serves voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; "ribbons of silver light" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor deduction for "violet sound" straining synesthesia coherence, but rhythm variation and final "rain of silver petals" charge closure impeccably.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ghost trope transformed through synesthetic specificity ("agony of loss laced with thrill of creation"). Emotional truth avoids cliché, though orchard setting borders on familiar without deeper transformation.</comment>
