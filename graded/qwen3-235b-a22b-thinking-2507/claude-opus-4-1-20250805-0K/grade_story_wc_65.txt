<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (mapping voids vs bureaucratic constraints), but Council members lack distinct flaws under pressure; their transformation feels slightly passive despite Mira's seeded agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: Vance's interrupted sentence crystallizes conceptual cost of lost certainty. Accumulative lens holds through density of visual algorithms narrowing options toward inevitable innovation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Kingfisher quill constrains choices (trembling strokes) and charges final image (cleaning nib). Obsidian Spire's shadowless quality evolves from atmospheric detail to thematic engine for "darkness that sees."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</comment><comment>Single deepening shift (mapping Council's blind spots) reweights dominant stake through Mira's agency. Cost is subtle but legible: her quiet smile reveals emotional toll of working unseen within constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through spire's reflection paradox and footprints on ice—no moralizing. Final image reweights "cultivated ignorance" as generative force without stating the thesis, resisting false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("maps of places that didn't exist—yet") with rhythmic control. Minor register drift in "predictive models" slightly jars Mira's tactile voice during high-pressure mapping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; "visual symphonies of probability" risks purple prose but earns payoff. One scaffold ("revolution but through evolution") slightly dampens final propulsion without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "innovator vs bureaucracy" trope through ignorance cartography. Fresh inflection: change occurs via seeded art, not confrontation. Lacks one bold risk (e.g., Council's internal friction) to reach 9.0.</comment>
