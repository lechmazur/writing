<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's motivation (proving emotion absorption) is rooted in lived experience, not abstract theory. Contradictory impulses (isolation vs hope) manifest physically through prism handling. Final choice to photograph the frost earns her revelation through prior causality; minor abstraction in grandmother's death memory slightly dilutes embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: pressure tightens via frost pattern density until prism reveals her emotions. Closure (Charged Poise) lands with visible cost (fading frost) and conceptual weight (rewriting science). "Shifted hush" motif names the lens by midpoint; cost is legible in "frost couldn't survive the coming warmth."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Quartz arbor's mist creates urgent time pressure; prism as micro-setting constrains choices (angle adjustment) and charges the final image (absorbing triumph). Sensory details ("humming pillars," "crystallized breath") reflect Vera's mystic perception, avoiding tourist catalog. Environment directly alters tactics by limiting observation window.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving emotion absorption) tightens through Vera's agency as frost patterns emerge. Her decision to adjust the prism angle narrows options, revealing her own emotions with visible cost (frost fading). Conceptual price (rewriting science) reweights the final image without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme (mind-matter fluidity) emerges through frost patterns as tangible lexicon, not statements. Final image of prism absorbing triumph offers non-literal answer to "do objects remember?" Avoids moralizing while embracing complexity; the ice map replaces abstraction with concrete proof.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Vera's perceptual signature ("emotional wavelengths," "geometric patterns") creates distinct voice. Modulates perfectly from lyrical revelation to urgent documentation. Free indirect style ("Truthful lies, the skeptics would say") maintains psychic distance; rhythm accelerates as mist lifts. Zero register drift during peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "crystallized breath" opening anchors voice/stakes. High density: "frost revealed her own emotions—decades of determination, isolation, and fierce hope crystallizing." Figurative language sparse but potent ("lexicon of feeling"). Final line recharges "truthful lies" without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis via ice lexicon transforms "emotion absorption" trope. Avoids abstraction through specific frost mechanics (car window memory → prism map). Risk-taking (scientific mysticism) heightens stakes without gimmickry; the prism's molecular translation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
