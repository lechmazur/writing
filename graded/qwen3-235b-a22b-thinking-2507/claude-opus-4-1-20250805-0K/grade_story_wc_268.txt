<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Syln’s embodied contradiction—devotion to preservation versus duty to truth—drives every choice. Her quiet endurance ("neither triumph nor sorrow") crystallizes Earned Stasis with visible cost when the pretender flees. No stock phrasing; "gnarled but steady" fingers trace deception with tangible history.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: true heir’s arrival crystallizes options while Syln’s return to ink-making bears the cost of vigilance. Causal lens holds—messages trigger responses that narrow options to the pellet’s decisive test. Constellation pauses anchor escalation without summary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The iron gall ink pellet functions as micro-setting, constraining Syln’s tactics (must dissolve in titan blood) and charging the final image as "truth crystallized." Library’s drifting dome actively pressures choices via constellation configurations, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally: marginal messages escalate to dimensional breach, forcing Syln’s pellet gambit. Cost is legible in her quiet endurance ("content in her graceful work")—the lifelong vigil’s end forecloses active justice for stewardship. Agency drives every escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through library-as-protagonist: "truth’s patient guardian against time’s conspiracy" avoids moralizing. Final image reweights truth not as victory but necessary labor ("returned to her ink-making"), resonating beyond plot without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "stone floors that had forgotten the sun" filters setting through Syln’s ancient lens. Rhythm modulates perfectly—compressed diction during breach ("The library shuddered") contrasts serene closure cadence. Zero POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; every line propels: "ink spread like living shadow, writing truth" merges action, theme, and closure. Final line recharges opening’s "tended shelves" with earned cadence. Zero figurative muddle even in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: library as living truth-keeper transforms fantasy tropes. Emotional specificity in Syln’s contentment ("graceful, necessary work") avoids power fantasies. Risk-taking with quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
