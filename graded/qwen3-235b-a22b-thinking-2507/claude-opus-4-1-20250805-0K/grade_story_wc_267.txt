<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority excels through embodied details (frostbite phantoms, discoloration observation), but Elena's dialogue risks thematic echo; contradictory impulses present yet final choice lacks simultaneous tension in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: warming stones and "frostbitten hope" reconfigure silence/sound with visceral cost (scars, nerve damage); Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation to crystallized final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cobalt stones' thermal shift charges closure; bolt and staircase discoloration constrain choices (piano repair, reunion); micro-setting specificity ("seventh step where someone knelt") shapes every pivotal moment without ornamentation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Marcus' agency (returning bolt), not coincidence; "safety in silence" trade-off crystallizes with felt cost (seven winters, throat scars); single deepening suffices for length but lacks explicit moral calculus escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through piano/silence reconfiguration; avoids moralizing until Elena's line ("too precious to waste") risks thematic echo, slightly muddying earned resonance despite strong final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("seraphically mundane," nerve "singing with music"); rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure; dialogue subtext-laden; no head-hopping despite reflective density within BRR limits.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cobalt stones warming" finale achieves maximum density; every phrase multi-tasks (e.g., "phantom sensations" conveys trauma/setting); no figurative muddle even in high-stakes reunion beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "haunted hotel" trope via acoustic physics; "frostbitten hope" synthesis feels inevitable; cobalt's thermal property redefines silence without gimmickry; risk-taking heightens stakes while maintaining emotional truth.</comment>
