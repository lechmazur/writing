<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marina's motivation as "first name basis with endings" is concrete through her documentation choices, but internal contradiction feels underdeveloped; her transition from analyst to transmitter lacks visible struggle despite strong embodied detail in the journal examination.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with the contracting air pocket's visible cost and the snow globe's recursion, but the Accumulative lens risks thin escalation—pressure relies more on environmental inevitability than protagonist-driven deepening of stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The library's micro-setting actively constrains choices through the air pocket's contraction, forcing Marina's documentation urgency and directly charging the final image with the snow globe's "phantom currents" as the environment reclaims space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten credibly as the air pocket shrinks, creating a live clock that narrows Marina's options, but the escalation leans slightly passive—her agency manifests in writing the note rather than actively combating the flooding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the snow globe's recursion and Marina's note, avoiding moralizing; the final line reweights "disappearance" as transformation without stating the concept, earning resonance through the library's physical reclamation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in phrases like "darkness thick as centuries" and rhythmic control under pressure ("She broke the surface at sunset"), with compression taught early via electromagnetic "whispers" paying off in the layered closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "verdigris but intact" and "sophisticated melancholy" achieve textural specificity without muddle, though "physics of letting go" edges toward abstraction before the snow globe's concrete payoff rescues it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms the "found object" trope through the snow globe's infinite recursion, with Earhart's discovery providing a fresh counterpoint; emotional specificity in "preservation and release are the same motion" avoids genericity.</comment>
