<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in her craving order yet accepting "mess," but epiphany leans slightly abstract; "composting the past" borders on thematic explanation without sufficient embodied struggle during the tile revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: mandala dissolution crystallizes "meaning isn't preserved but discovered" with visible cost in her shifted perception of the hush, under Accumulative lens where sensory density replaces causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Whispering grotto actively constrains choices—sound patterns dictate sand placement—and the tile flake (micro-setting) charges the final image; limestone walls "glowing faintly" proves environment shapes closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding meaning in ritual) tightens through tile revelation deepening her understanding; cost is visceral in the hush transforming from "empty" to "humming with potential," driven entirely by her agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: crumbling tile completes the mandala, rejecting "order" for "mess," culminating in non-literal closure where blank spaces become "brave" story-painting grounds—zero moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in tactile details ("chalk reveals textures invisible to casual touch"), but "composting the past" momentarily drifts into thematic diction; otherwise, rhythmic control under pressure is masterful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; "grains sliding into new configurations that mapped the grotto's acoustic architecture" exemplifies high-density propulsion, though "composting the past" slightly muddies peak-beat clarity without severe artifact penalties.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "ritual forgetting" through acoustic architecture and sand mandalas; "emergent hush" redefines silence as fertile space with emotional specificity, avoiding abstraction via chalk-stained fingers and crumbling tile.</comment>
