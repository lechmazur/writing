<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority shines through musical metaphors ("reading winds like sheet music") avoiding therapy-speak; micro-choices (playing melody backwards) reveal hierarchy of values with embodied cost in confronting unforgiven selves.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stakes with undeniable conceptual cost: "pixelated prison of regret" reconfigures her role as ferryman; Accumulative lens holds perfectly through glass flake's revelation sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fiddle and glass flake function as micro-settings constraining choice (playing specific melodies unlocks doorways); final image of bridges forming in "amber air" charges closure through tool-specific pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency (deciding to play backwards) deepens under Accumulative lens; cost unmistakable in "all versions of herself she'd refused to forgive" with visible trade-off crystallizing her stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (music as bridge-building), not abstraction; final image of playing for "whoever might be listening" offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shadows danced differently when storms approached") modulates rhythm under pressure; zero head-hopping as voice compresses during climax ("notes scattered like silver light").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; lyrical precision avoids overwriting ("pixelated amnesty made tangible" serves plot); final line’s "amber air" specificity avoids cliché while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms bridge-trope via musical physics ("walk upon sound"); scaffold wrap flutters as notation system synthesizes fresh inflection with emotional truth in "necessary steps in larger composition".</comment>
