<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Amara's micro-choices (decoding, debris arrangement) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure, but Marcus lacks sufficient contradiction as a ghostly guide. The "searing weight" realization earns embodied emotion, though final thematic echo slightly undermines unearned epiphany guardrails.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Conceptual Repricing (lagoon as mirror) with undeniable cost in "searing weight of it," but retrocognitive trap release lacks causal buildup. Accumulative lens holds as density of erased names reweights truth's cost, though the parley's resolution feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon constrains choices (must descend to arrange debris) and charges the final infinity reflection. Zeppelin's "floor-to-ceiling windows" anchor spatial urgency, but desert sensory details remain generically "shifting" without tactile specificity during key moments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs movement myth) tightens when Marcus warns reading "wrong could destroy everything," with Amara's debris arrangement forcing irreversible trade-off. Cost legible in "love and betrayal inseparable," though the resolution's emotional calibration edges toward tidiness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete debris patterns and erased names, avoiding moralizing until the final "truth and tension were not opposites" line—a thematic echo that triggers penalty. The lagoon-as-mirror image earns resonance, but late abstraction slightly undermines organic emergence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct archivist voice ("retrocognitively locked," "parley") modulates under stress with rhythmic control, though Marcus's dialogue leans expository. Perceptual signature shines in "bleached wood and stones" selection, but temporal vertigo phrasing flirts with therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "clutched the diary to her chest" conveys embodied urgency without filter verbs. "Searing reverie" avoids overwriting through context, though "temporal vertigo" edges toward clinical abstraction in one high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms archive tropes via retrocognitive truth-telling where betrayal enables survival. Risk distinction in lagoon-as-mirror synthesis feels inevitable, though civil rights setting risks familiarity without Amara's specific archivist lens anchoring it.</comment>
