<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (duty vs truth-telling) drives choices, but motivation leans passive; micro-choices lack tangible friction despite strong embodied emotion in "photograph trembled in his hands." Flaw: resolution feels unearned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: Marcus's vow to develop photos forecloses denial with visible cost ("talisman against forgetting"). Orientation anchors by line 25; Accumulative lens holds through "mirrored hush" reconfiguration. Minor deduction: lens ambiguity in midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sapphire bottle functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (photographing it) and charging the final image ("caught moonlight in his pocket"). Sensory details ("slick stone," "black mirrors") reflect urgency without checklist fatigue; silt-filled fountain evolves causally with drainage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs official narrative) tightens via photo discovery, narrowing options to bearing witness. Cost legible in "expunged records" and Elena's fate, but escalation lacks active pressure—Marcus's agency feels observational rather than contested under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "spinning fragments into shared meaning" crystallizes in final wind chime song. Avoids moralizing; "precisely humane lie" reframes progress as erasure. Slight deduction: thematic weight leans on exposition ("three families who refused to leave").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("rooftops emerged like ancient teeth") persists under pressure. Rhythmic control shines in cadence shifts (short sentences during photo discovery). No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates cleanly from clinical ("methodical precision") to intimate ("Elena's laugh").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; "waterlogged street sign" and "silt-filled fountain" show textural specificity. Minor deduction: "mirrored hush" repetition borders on template cadence in high-pressure beats. Final line’s lyricism ("world of sound and story") avoids sentimentality through concrete imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms drowned-town trope via photographic evidence and levee warden POV. "Torrington’s Tonic" detail creates fresh inflection, but reservoir resurfacing premise lacks non-obvious risk. Emotional truth in Elena’s erased story outweighs surface novelty; avoids safety middle via moral ambiguity.</comment>
