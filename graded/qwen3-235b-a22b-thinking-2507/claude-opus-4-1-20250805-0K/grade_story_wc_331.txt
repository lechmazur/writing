<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through Marcus’s analog-memory philosophy versus his ritualistic actions; embodied emotion in scarf-unhooking micro-choice. Final endurance (continuing shift) earns cost via unraveling threads—no epiphanies, only quiet acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds flawlessly: density peaks at midnight vision (Charged Poise closure). Cost is felt in scarf’s unraveling and "vision collapsed gently"—reconfiguring "where stories live" from location to topology. No causality breaks; orientation clear by paragraph 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Tattered scarf functions as micro-setting: catches on shelves, grows warm, charges final image. Library’s hyperbolic architecture actively constrains choices (aisle 7.5), not backdrop. Sensory details ("old paper and possibility") filtered through Marcus’s mathematical-poetic bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake (finding stories’ living place) tightens via Marcus’s agency—guiding patrons, tracing marginalia—culminating in midnight vision. Cost is subtle but legible: scarf’s unraveling signifies time’s passage within analog memory. Pressure grows through density, not false escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from scarf’s unraveling and library’s geometry—no thematic echo. Final image ("new patterns would emerge") reweights "stories live everywhere" without moralizing. Complexity embraced: memory’s imperfection as art, not nostalgia.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Marcus notices hyperbolic curves, marginalia, scarf texture. Rhythm modulates from lyrical ("equations bloomed into verse") to precise ("traced a hyperbolic curve"). Zero POV drift; voice consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold—e.g., "shelves that smelled of old paper and possibility" compresses setting/theme. Final line recharges scarf motif with propulsion. Figurative language precise ("parallel lines converged like memories"); zero muddle in peak vision beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: hyperbolic geometry as emotional/spatial framework, not trope. Transformation test passed—swap "scientific poetry library" for generic "mystic library" and logic collapses. Risk-taking (math as heart) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
