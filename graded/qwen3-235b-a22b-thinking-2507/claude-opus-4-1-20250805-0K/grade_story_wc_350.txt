<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marta's motivation is clear and actions consistent, but lacks contradictory impulses or visible flaw that compounds under pressure. 'Empathetically decisive' trait demonstrates skill without struggle, missing the internal conflict required for 9+. No irrationality or self-deception roots her choices in human contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Earned Stasis closure lands with unmistakable cost in 'coaxing decades of isolation like drawing poison' imagery. Accumulative lens holds from 'languages as necessity' through polyglot chorus to dawn gathering. Final weight-swing image crystallizes Charged Poise with conceptual cost between divisions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Clock tower's resonance chamber and brass weight constrain Marta's tactics, charging the closure image where the weight 'keeps time between earth and sky.' Micro-setting functions as environmental pressure—acoustics enable the pendulum system essential to the chorus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative pressure builds through Marta's agency: each elevator joining the chorus tightens social fabric with visible cost in 'drawing poison' effort. Dawn gathering shows irreversible change—farmers sharing seeds—fulfilling band guardrail for 8.8+ with cost charging the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the seven-language card and polyglot chorus avoid moralizing. Final image 'teaching old structures to speak new languages' reweights silos as bridges without stating a moral, offering resonant non-literal answer to communication breakdown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature evident in Marta's musical noticing ('tower's natural pitch,' 'vocal cords'). Rhythmic control under pressure: syntax compresses during high-stakes singing ('Ja, yes, oui') while maintaining voice coherence. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; 'brass gears clicking in counterpoint to the wind' exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. High density in 'porch lights flickering on' sequence conveys transformation without overwriting. 'Empathetically decisive' slightly label-y but immediately grounded in library intuition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of architecture as vocal cords avoids trope familiarity through specific linguistic mechanics. Transformation test fails if elevators swapped—agricultural context is essential. Risk-taking in polyglot sound heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
