<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (grief vs. wisdom) act simultaneously in mending scene; final choice earned through daughter's tools discovery. Slight underdevelopment of Mira's internal conflict prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("deciduous vow falling away like leaves"). Causal lens holds through vow-breaking → tool discovery → teaching chain. Midpoint lens clarity slightly soft.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Orchard setting actively constrains choices (rope ladder access, silken threads for eyes) and charges final image. Micro-setting (tools in bag) directly shapes mending tactics. Near-perfect sensory selectivity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency (unpacking bag, teaching Mira) under causal lens. Cost unmistakable in "deciduous vow falling away" with visible relationship transformation. Secondary stake (Council) slightly under-tightened.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reweighting of "deciduous vows" by orchard imagery. Final line ("breaches could become doorways") offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. "Best wisdom arrives by accident" edges toward statement but saved by metaphor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("deciduous vows—like autumn leaves") shows mender's lens. Rhythmic control under pressure ("fumbled... found familiar shapes"). Dialogue carries subtext in "Council won't like this" exchange.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; high density ("seeds carried by wind... took root in dust" does triple duty). Final line ("tools hummed") charges closure without figurative muddle. One minor stock phrase ("knobby elbows") redeemed by context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: crystal healing guild + orchard cathedral transforms trope. Emotional specificity in mending ritual avoids genericity. Risk-taking (lyric setting as active constraint) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
