<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lacks interior contradiction; Mira's devotion is unwavering with no embodied struggle beyond physical fatigue. Her whispered "Tell me" reveals hunger for connection, but no visible cost like doubt or sacrifice deepens her motivation under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands flawlessly: spirits settling as sediment with masks transformed into monuments. Cost is legible in Mira's "inheritance" realization—endless cyclical duty charged by the sanctuary's embrace holding "all." Accumulative lens holds through unraveling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary constrains every choice: moonlight fracturing creates the "interlaced hush," humming prisms intensify starlight to illuminate masks, and final embrace charges closure. Tool (needle) and setting are inseparable from the ritual's mechanics and emotional weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation as knots release fragments, but pressure lacks tangible resistance—Mira never faces a meaningful obstacle like a fragment that won't reassemble. Cost is felt in her exhaustion yet not dramatized as a trade-off during the work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges through the "interlaced hush" transforming from poetic concept to literal silence holding weight. Final image—"every fractured thing could find its way back home"—resonates without moralizing, reweighting remembrance as active mending rather than passive tribute.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices "cracks sealed with hemp that glowed faintly silver" and "porcelain painted with scales." Rhythm modulates perfectly from "hemp resisted, then surrendered" to flowing visions, with elision ("time folded") taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "net lay coiled like a sleeping serpent" and "silence so profound it had weight" achieve high density without muddle. Final line recharges "fractured thing" motif with earned resonance, avoiding sentimentality through concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "mask restorer" trope through specific craft: net fibers becoming thread, prisms as active conduits. "Interlaced hush" concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in making silence the ritual's medium heightening emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
