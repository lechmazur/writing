<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Edgar’s interior contradiction—fear of exposure versus yearning for connection—drives micro-choices (e.g., lowering the light) with embodied cost. The archivist’s off-page presence tests his endurance, but her late revelation limits relationship depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Edgar’s realization ("becoming visible wasn’t about emerging") reconfigures stakes with felt cost ("hand tightened on the tape fragment"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density shifts during the blackout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The copper pipe and tape fragments function as micro-settings that constrain Edgar’s movement and choices, charging the final image. "Sapphire hush" evolves from atmospheric detail to emotional resonance without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via Edgar’s agency—his cache delivery forces stance crystallization. Cost is legible in his physical reaction to the archivist’s words, though the archivist’s sudden revelation slightly softens prior tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the tape fragments’ "constellation of memory" reweights into collaboration. Final image ("keeper of sense memories") avoids moralizing while crystallizing the cost of connection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in Edgar’s tactile focus ("coolness fade," "dust motes"). Rhythmic compression during the blackout ("Emergency lighting hadn’t activated") modulates pressure without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "smell of hot vacuum tubes" exemplifies high-density prose. Minor overwriting in the reflection paragraph ("building’s autobiography") slightly dilutes momentum but avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library ghost trope through tactile tech preservation. Risk-taking in quiet closure elevates stakes, though "sapphire hush" risks quirkiness without the archivist’s earned vulnerability.</comment>
