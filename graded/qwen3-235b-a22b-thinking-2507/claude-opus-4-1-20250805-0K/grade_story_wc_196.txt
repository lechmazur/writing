<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Marcus prioritizing archives over Sarah while seeking maternal truth; embodied emotion in "button warming in his palm" avoids labels. Final choice to build counter-narrative index earns closure through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost: "healing came not from finding perfect story" crystallizes options amid dust resettling. Accumulative lens holds—pressure builds through marginalia discoveries narrowing his search focus.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dust patterns function as micro-setting that constrains choice (reading files via accumulation) and charges final image ("disturbance rebellion against forgetting"). Sensory specificity avoids white-room syndrome through concrete anchors like metallic button whispers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake ("real story" vs bureaucratic version) tightens via agency-driven discoveries: disturbed dust patterns prompt Timothy's file search. Deepening shift occurs when Marcus recognizes his own breadcrumbs, with cost legible in "mother's file was here somewhere."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through button/marginalia particulars; ending reweights premise via "imperfect attempts scattered throughout unknown histories" without moralizing. Final image ("repository of society's most vulnerable histories") offers resonant non-literal answer to search for love.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Marcus noticing "dust motes unfurl like tiny spirits"; rhythmic control under pressure via fragments ("Marcus sat down slowly"). No head-hopping; elision of Sarah taught early and paid off through cost.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "dust had its own language" doing triple duty. Figurative language ("spirits released from bondage") clarifies pressure without muddle. Final line achieves propulsion through concrete image, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archaeology metaphor with foster care archives avoids tropes through specific button/marginalia details. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes—quiet closure charges "imperfect attempts" as inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
