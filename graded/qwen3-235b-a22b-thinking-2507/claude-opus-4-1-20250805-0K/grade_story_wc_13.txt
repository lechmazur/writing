<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marina’s contradictory impulses (avoiding/finalizing illustrations) drive her climactic choice; embodied emotion in "pencil froze" and micro-choices like ignoring time-sculptors reveal authentic stakes without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: cracked pendant and clear canals reconfigure time’s flow with conceptual cost ("evaporated borrowed minutes"); causal lens holds through every beat from hum to stirring.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rooftop canals constrain choices (leaping boats) and charge the final image; temporal residue in water evolves causally to "run clear," while the cracked pendant embodies irreplaceable micro-setting pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven solely by Marina’s agency: pendant’s intensifying hum compels canal journey, gap dive, and drawing completion; cost legible in evaporated minutes and premature stirring, though Morteus’s role slightly softens stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "honored in their ending" crystallizes without moralizing; final image of living creatures reweights extinction’s cost through cracked pendant and clear canals, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "water flowing impossibly upward"; rhythmic compression during canal leap ("leaped between canal boats") modulates under pressure without syntax slippage or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "temporal residue" does triple duty (worldbuilding/stakes/atmosphere); final line’s "uninterrupted flow" recharges opening motifs with crystalline clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "borrowed time" trope via extinct creatures’ final moments; emotional specificity in honoring endings avoids safety middle, though giant’s role edges toward familiar archetype without full transformation.</comment>
