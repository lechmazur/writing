<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Marta's shift from grief-bound routine to embracing circular care; embodied emotion peaks when "violence would destroy the very connections she sought to reveal" during thread untangling. No diagnostic labels undercut authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: rewinding the chess clock but not starting it crystallizes time's transformation. Lens holds as accumulative—each thread deepens grief's shape until the final image reconfigures "the border between life and death" as a garden path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The cobalt silo and tapestry border actively constrain choices: frayed threads demand patient untangling, while the silo's "velveteen gloom" charges the final gardening act. "Starlight that pooled in the cobalt silo's shadow" makes setting a tactile, character-particular anchor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation lacks narrowing options; wind's "distant applause" and stars' movement deepen atmosphere but don't test Marta's resolve. Cost is felt in her changed relationship to time (rewound clock), yet pressure remains atmospheric rather than forcing a trade-off under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "the shape of intentions wasn't angular or defined—it was circular" avoids moralizing. Final image of gardening in "velveteen gloom" reweights grief as tending, with cost legible in Marta's shift from timing rounds to planting the tapestry itself.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "velveteen gloom" and "uncharted echoes" reflect Marta's gardener-linguist mind. Rhythmic control peaks in "Thread by thread, the tapestry revealed itself as a map of grief transformed into devotion," compressing revelation without loss of texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "frayed threads that formed a kind of script" exemplifies high-density prose. Slight overwriting in "pre-dawn sky" description (-0.3) prevents 9.5, but "rewound the chess clock but didn't start it" demonstrates flawless rhythm under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms cemetery tropes through the tapestry's "intentional patterns rather than random decay." The "circular, seasonal" grief reframing feels inevitable yet fresh, with risk-taking in making the sovereign case a "reliquary" for encoded love rather than literal treasure.</comment>
