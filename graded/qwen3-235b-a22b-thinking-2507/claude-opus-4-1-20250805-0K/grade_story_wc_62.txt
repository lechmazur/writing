<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Martha’s contradictory impulses—carving individual pain while weaving collective strength—manifest in tactile micro-choices (chisel pressure, ribbon tracing). Closure choice (retracing names) earned through decades of practice and family lore, with felt cost in grandfather’s departure. No diagnostic labels; embodied grief via milkweed and granite.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density escalates via carved family stories converging with monarch urgency. Closure as Charged Poise—grandfather’s fading presence spreads among mourners, transforming grief into strength. Cost legible in "voice had faded with the completion," crystallizing irreversible loss against migration’s deadline.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Greenhouse and ribbon function as micro-setting: milkweed proximity guides Martha’s work rhythm, while ribbon’s woven grain constrains carving technique. Final image (wind releasing poems south) charged by glass walls holding words, making environment indispensable to closure’s conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via November’s approach—migration deadline forces Martha’s accelerated carving, narrowing options to "one meaningful tightening." Agency drives escalation: her retrace ritual responds to grandfather’s urgency, with cost (his departure) inseparable from completed memorial. Stakes visceral through Nguyen/Johnson/Garcia micro-stories.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through granite’s grain and monarchs’ flight—no moralizing. Final image (poems carried south) reweights grief as collective migration, avoiding tidy resolution. Subtext in Sofia Garcia’s touch on stone; thematic echo avoided as Martha’s speech mirrors grandfather’s calm without stating thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature: carver’s tactile focus ("grief has grain, like wood") shapes syntax. Under stress, compression ("Show me") heightens pressure. Consistent 3rd-limited POV; spectral dialogue carries subtext via inherited calm. No register drift; lyric elision (monarchs’ arrival teaching pattern) paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "indigo threads catching last rays" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Closure beat ("wind was right") avoids figurative muddle. Sentence rhythm varies: short staccato ("Show me") during tension, flowing cadence for Neruda/Rumi verses. No artifacts in final paragraph; propulsion maintained through concrete verbs ("spiral," "retraced").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: pandemic grief refracted through monarch migration and ribbon weaving. Specificity anchors universals (Nguyen’s three generations, Sofia Garcia’s touch). Risk-taking in spectral mentorship avoids cliché via tactile guidance ("feel for it"). Emotional truth in collective memorial’s design—no safety-hedging.</comment>
