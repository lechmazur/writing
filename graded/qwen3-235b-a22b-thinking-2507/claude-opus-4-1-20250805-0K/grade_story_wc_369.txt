<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus's embodied healing ("old cuts sealing, arthritis retreating") and micro-choices (deconstructing/reassembling sextant) reveal his shift from maintenance to transformation. Flaw: "thirty years" backstory told not shown through present choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("broken instruments sometimes measure most precisely"), but the "pin dropping" moment feels coincidental rather than earned escalation under Accumulative lens, slightly weakening pressure coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sextant constrains every choice (aligning fragments to catch moonlight) and charges final image ("ivy's slow pulse"). Tower's broken dome enables revelation—environment actively shapes the thematic resolution without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding labyrinth's purpose) tightens when Marcus realizes it processes sorrow, foreclosing his old role. Cost visible in transformed sextant, but "pin dropping" coincidence undermines protagonist-driven escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through equations mapping grief ("x equals weight of absence"), not abstraction. Final line reweights "broken instruments" as precise measures of sorrow without moralizing—resonant, earned, and conceptually charged.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: notices mechanical details ("graduated arc," "microscopic notations"). Stress shortens syntax ("Thunder rolled... perfect silence fell"). Minor flaw: "familiar tingling began" slightly over-tells healing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("Each reflection illuminated..."). Final line resonates without neatness. One borderline abstraction ("machine for processing sorrow") saved by sextant mechanics context—no closure dulling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "grief in equations" through astronomer's precise loss ("seven years, three months, fourteen days"). Tree-witness concept ("seasons as heartbeats") synthesizes sorrow/growth uniquely—fresh inflection rooted in prior mechanics.</comment>
