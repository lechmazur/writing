<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "not her father's fire, nor merely its opposition" moment; embodied emotion avoids therapy-speak despite high stakes; micro-choices during ritual reveal value hierarchy with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "proof that even the deepest burns can become doorways" crystallizes identity reconfiguration with undeniable conceptual cost; Accumulative lens held rigorously through volcanic memory pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon actively constrains choices (holds tears, supplies kelp) and charges final image; black sand's "volcanic memory" transforms from burden to nurturer, directly shaping ritual tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (identity reconciliation) tightens meaningfully during grafting ritual; cost is unmistakable in "tears—not grief anymore, but something clearer. Recognition"; agency drives every escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "scars can sing" motif and ritual mechanics without moralizing; final image reweights "burns" as "doorways" with resonant ambiguity, avoiding tidy binaries while honoring complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("firefighter's hands," volcanic lexicon) creates distinct rhythm; compression during ritual ("filled the coin's hollow") teaches pattern early, paid off in closure's "kelp-drift peace" with zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "strand of kelp touched her ankle, soft as forgiveness" exemplifies high-density propulsion; figurative language ("clouds gathered in their great procession") serves pressure without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms firefighter/arsonist trope through volcanic ritual specificity; "grafting" metaphor feels inevitable yet fresh; avoids safety middle with morally complex father figure while maintaining emotional truth.</comment>
