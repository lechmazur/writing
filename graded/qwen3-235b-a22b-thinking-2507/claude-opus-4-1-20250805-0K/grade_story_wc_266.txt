<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "I was never brave enough to let him run free" confession, but emotional progression lacks sufficient irrationality; change feels earned yet slightly smooth without deeper hypocrisy layers pre-crossing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "fingers that knew how to open" crystallizes the cost of unused courage with star-punched light; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through atmospheric pressure without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Limestone ridgeway and ticket punch constrain choices—pawprints dictate indirect routes, star punch charges final image; sensory details ("mist clung like unspoken prayers") mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Marina's confession about leash-gripping, narrowing options to release; cost is legible in transformed relationship with the leash, though escalation leans slightly passive under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: snapped leash becomes courage metaphor, avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "unused courage" as star-shaped spaces without stated moral, achieving Conceptual Repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in tactile details ("leather finally giving way," "pawprints"), but "shoreline lullaby quality" slightly drifts into elevated diction during high-pressure beats without sufficient voice motivation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffolding in "though even as the words left her mouth" and template cadence in ferry guides' dialogue; no closure-dulling artifacts, but synonym churn ("gently persistent rhythm"/"shoreline lullaby quality") slightly muddies density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ferry mythos through dog leash metaphor; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes—Marina's courage isn't found but released, avoiding safety-middle tropes with specific lived detail.</comment>
