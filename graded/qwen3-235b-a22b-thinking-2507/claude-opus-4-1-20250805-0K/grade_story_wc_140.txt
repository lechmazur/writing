<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mari's motivation—using bureaucratic error to dissolve into collecting lost stories—is rooted in trauma and embodied through tactile memory ("fabric unraveling"). Contradictory impulses (ghosthood vs. seeking connection) drive her signing the annotation, earning visible cost without diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: "erased histories leave textures... permanent as rust" crystallizes stakes with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds via layered annotations, and tide rhythm shapes tactics from discovery to spring tide climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Container labyrinth functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (navigating by echo patterns, high-tide access) and charges the final image ("rust on steel"). Sensory details like "wet ink" and "groaning metal" are selective, urgent, and POV-filtered through Mari's texture-based perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes (existence as erased person) tighten through Mari's agency: her annotation additions culminate in the spring tide discovery of "We who don't exist must testify." The felt cost—signing with hybrid identity while carrying the death certificate "true and false"—reconfigures options without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: poison label's "complex weave," layered annotations. Final image ("rust on steel") offers resonant, non-literal answer to erased histories without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo while embracing ambiguity through "congregation" of the mislabeled.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("memory's texture," "echo patterns") and rhythmic control shine in "ink still wet: 'We who don't exist must testify'." Purposeful elision (death certificate backstory) is taught early and pays off in closure without POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "truth compressed into small, lethal fragments." Figurative language ("memories that refused to die correctly") remains precise in peak beats. Paragraph cuts ("Mari walked out...") accelerate toward closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms bureaucratic erasure into liberation: containers as archives of the dissolved. Specificity (tide rhythm, poison label's emotional weave) avoids tropes, while risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without obscuring the Charged Poise closure.</comment>
