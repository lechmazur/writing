<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in molting as method ("not madness but method"), with embodied micro-choices like taping Rumi beside graffiti. Final endurance earns cost through Marcus's prison-bar moon imagery, but secondary pressure lacks on-page tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stakes when moonlight hits the coffee tin's "luminous fractures," reconfiguring revolution as fragile growth with felt cost. Accumulative lens holds through density escalation in rebuilding the anthology, one fragment at a time.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rusted library's absent roof constrains action (moonlight dependency) and charges final image—tin's fractures mirror the anthology's "luminous fractures." Tool (coffee tin) and recurring object (torn pages) actively shape choices, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through October's agency: rebuilding the anthology narrows options to this fragile act of resistance. Cost is unmistakable in Marcus's "fear of becoming illegible," but secondary pressure lacks escalation beyond internal tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete acts—rebuilding books from fragments—avoiding moralizing. Final line ("revolution grows one name at a time") offers resonant CR reweighting resistance as quiet accumulation, not spectacle, with no stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "liquid silver" moonlight and "luminous fractures," with rhythm accelerating during rebuilding. Voice modulates under pressure (train whistle ignored), and elision of prison backstory is paid off through Marcus's influence on her method.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "burnt but legible" Neruda page exemplifies high-density propulsion. Figurative language ("molted personalities monthly like a snake sheds skin") serves character without muddle, and final line’s cadence deepens closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "blooming resistance" as book-reconstruction—non-obvious angle on revolution. Specificity anchors universals: coffee tin false bottom, prison-bar moon imagery. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
