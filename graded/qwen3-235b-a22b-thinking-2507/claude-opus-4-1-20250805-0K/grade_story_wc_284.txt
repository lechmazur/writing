<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Margot’s contradictory impulses (burned vs. forged) manifest in embodied choices like pocketing both pillboxes; Viktor’s "operation didn’t fail" explanation risks near-diagnostic phrasing but avoids therapy-speak through concrete stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: "no longer burned but forged" crystallizes the identity shift with felt cost in the melting snow-codes and folder’s weight; causal lens holds perfectly from Moscow burn to delivery choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The pillbox constrains every choice (pocket weight, deciphering coordinates) and charges the final image; "frozen rock face" isn’t generic—it enables Margot’s tactile memory of Moscow’s betrayal, directly shaping her stance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Margot’s agency: deciphering snow-codes narrows options to trust Viktor; cost is unmistakable in the folder’s "heavier than any mission" weight and melting codes, tightening under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "unused courage" reweighted from morphine tablet to action; final image ("no longer burned but forged") offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Margot’s intelligence-trained noticing ("Cyrillic letters formed by packed snow") modulates under stress; rhythmic control shines in sparse dialogue ("You let me burn") with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("courage compressed into four syllables" embodies emotion); "silver hush" motif evolves from atmosphere to thematic anchor without figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms spy tropes through specific emotional stakes (unused courage as literal morphine tablet); "burned to forged" synthesis feels inevitable, with bold risk in quiet closure charging the dominant stake.</comment>
