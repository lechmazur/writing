<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Amira's grief-driven scientific rigor shows contradictory impulses (clutching geode vs steady voice during alarm). Micro-choices like transmitting data reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost—career risk for truth. No diagnostic labels; embodied emotion in "bleak exhilaration" and resonant final grip on the geode.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: security breach juxtaposed with "she smiled" as data transmits. Causal lens holds—geode placement causes scanner spike, forcing data transmission before alarm. Cost proof crystallized in "Security burst through the doors, but she smiled," reconfiguring stakes via transmitted truth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Geode functions as micro-setting: handled in five beats (palm weight, scanner interface, frequency adjustment, resonance, warmth) and charges closure via "remembered how to hope." Observatory elevation isn't backdrop—it enables the discovery ("boundary thinner"), constraining Amira's tactics and validating her months of planning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally: scanner reveals consciousness patterns → alarm cuts cooling time → security forces data transmission. Amira's agency drives every turn; the "forty minutes" clock tightens options visibly. Cost is dual: institutional backlash ("call you traumatized") and conceptual upheaval as "unused potential" shifts from theory to actionable truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through physics ("energy cannot be destroyed") and the geode's evolution, avoiding moralizing. Final image—"Tomorrow's stolen dreams would find new dreamers"—reweights the premise non-literally as Amira rejects "harnessing" for "returning," charging prior material with earned hope. No thematic echo; complexity embraces loss without false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Amira notices molecular structures and perturbation patterns ("probability clouds that shouldn't exist"). Voice modulates under pressure—longer sentences during theory, clipped urgency at alarm ("Help me"). Chen's dialogue carries subtext ("You knew"), avoiding convergence; lexicon stays within scientific POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("pools of unused potential that gather like water in hidden valleys" merges image/theme/physics). Final line crystallizes motif without cliché. Minor deduction for "intangibly tangible" (borderline abstract) but redeemed by immediate embodiment ("weight of unlived moments pressing against reality's thin membrane").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms sci-fi tropes through specific grief physics: "unused potential" as quantifiable resource pools near violence sites. Geode's evolution from trauma artifact to hope vessel avoids sentimentality. Risk-taking (science-meets-spirituality) heightens stakes coherently—the observatory's elevation isn't gimmickry but causal necessity.</comment>
