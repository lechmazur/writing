<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's micro-choices (forging documents while encoding truth) reveal layered values under pressure, but Marcus lacks depth as secondary pressure; coffee stain mechanics feel diagnostic rather than embodied in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (Marcus's horrified recognition), but coffee stain divination mechanics aren't dramatized early enough to fully drive causality under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Velvet observatory and ice violin function as micro-settings constraining choices—the jasmine's telepathic warning directly alters Elara's stance, charging the dissolution climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through Elara's coffee-stain vision ("salvation vs truth"), but the single tightening lacks visceral cost escalation; Marcus's realization carries conceptual weight without physical forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ice-singers' stolen music rather than moralizing; final line ("mulberry blood") reweights "dream vs empire" without stating a moral, avoiding Thematic Echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("stains spread across porcelain base"), but "mulberry wine" simile feels overwrought in high-pressure beat, slightly disrupting rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops, but "perforated destiny" is abstract label-speak; "telepathic chorus overwhelming her senses" borders on purple prose in climax without pattern-teaching.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "stolen artifact" trope through ice-singers' specificity and coffee-stain divination; plant telepathy avoids gimmickry by constraining Elara's choices with tangible cost.</comment>
