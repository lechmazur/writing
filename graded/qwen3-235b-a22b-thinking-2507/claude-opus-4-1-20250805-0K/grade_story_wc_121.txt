<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in "conquering vs. integrating" self, but micro-choices under pressure lack specific embodied conflict during pivotal fragmentation; soldier/mother/hermit facets merge abstractly without tactical tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully with "labyrinth hadn't been conquered—it had been integrated," cost visible in crumbling tablet and grounded touch; procedural viaduct's pressure escalation under Accumulative lens flawless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Viaduct's shifting glow (amber→green) and bioluminescent moss constrain choice through procedural generation; "shadows that moved independently" charges final image but raindrop ripple motif lacks causal pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early ("trapped her since first touch"), but escalation relies on internal realization rather than protagonist-driven pressure; "pressing the rune" choice lacks tactical consequence beyond theme.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "drop met ripple" reweights childhood fall as integration, not conquest; avoids moralizing while charging "darkening brightness" with conceptual cost of chosen timeline.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "runes burning cold through her shirt" and quantum foam fractures; rhythmic control peaks in "wooden planks, steel cables, bone and sinew" procedural stutter without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fractured timelines" metaphor maintains physical logic while "shadows with grasping fingers" achieves textural specificity; final line "drop met ripple" crystallizes propulsion without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravity defiance and quantum selves avoids trope; "periodically eternal" tablet transforms familiar artifact through causal integration with closure, but procedural generation lacks non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>
