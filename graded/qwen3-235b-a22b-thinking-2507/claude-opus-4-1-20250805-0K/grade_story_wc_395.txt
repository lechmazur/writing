<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "brightly attentive" trait driving her search while suppressing personal connection to Apollo-X, but emotional degradation under stress lacks nuance during climax; patch embodiment anchors final choice with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing ("we're not missing, we're archived") lands with undeniable conceptual cost in her transformation; Accumulative lens holds through pattern density escalation, with orientation solidly anchored by elevator/server details within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mission patch constrains choice throughout and charges final image; server graveyard setting actively pressures tactics (navigating cache layers), transforming from white-room into tactile constraint during recipe decoding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via Lila's agency decoding patterns (4827→coordinates→shadow network), narrowing options to archival with visible cost; dominant stake ("where deleted files go") tightens through her choices rather than coincidence under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of digital absence/presence emerges solely through concrete actions (decoding RGB values, recipe coordinates), culminating in resonant final line reweighting "sensed absence" without moralizing; avoids thematic echo through earned conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("digital ghosts," "sensed absence") modulates rhythm under pressure; free indirect style maintains consistent focalization with syntactic shifts reflecting data archaeology ("she dove deeper" vs. lyrical closure).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; high-density prose ("graveyard of deleted profiles," "corrupted files from Apollo-X") multiplies function without muddling; final beat "they were waiting" avoids cliché while charging closure with perfect rhythmic cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital archaeology and human loss transforms missing-person trope through specific mechanics (ingredient-coordinates, RGB patterns); risk-taking lyric accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring the archive's conceptual cost.</comment>
