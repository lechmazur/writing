<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "silence was not emptiness but possibility" and embodied choices like the stumble, but singing after seven years needs more physiological grounding in the pivotal moment to reach 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost in "rusty voice" and thematic weight of "brokenness sing," though the curtain discovery slightly strains causality within the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Abandoned train functions as micro-setting: loose board directly causes stumble, while sawdust/fog constrain perception; final image of "whispering gleam through patient fog" charges closure with environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Emil's "quietly persistent" trait with visible cost (voice strain), but wind bells' time dilation doesn't actively tighten decisions—serves atmosphere over tactical pressure per element definition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "brokenness sing" reweights "silence as possibility" without moralizing, avoiding the final paragraph's thematic echo trap through embodied action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("misting hush felt alive, breathing") and rhythmic control during singing beat showcase voice cohesion; no POV slippage despite surreal garden transition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion until climax: "light spread like water, not harsh but whispering" creates metaphor contradiction in peak beat, slightly dulling closure's clarity despite strong density elsewhere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "silent craftsman" trope through specific deafness/carving details; risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off via halo fragment's irreplaceable role in charging the final image.</comment>
