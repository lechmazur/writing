<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara’s "contentment died" protest versus her racing heart during the climb; embodied emotion in "something unlock in her chest" avoids therapy-speak. Micro-choices like fastening the hairpin reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands decisively with "you are the territory itself," reweighting rebirth through Mara’s visceral recognition ("felt cost" in unlocking chest). Accumulative/Textural lens holds as spiral perception tightens options toward Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The scalloped floor—visible only from height—constrains choice and charges the final image where "spiral she saw not history but possibility." Micro-setting (jade pin) evolves from heirloom to "key" across beats without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Mara’s climb: height enables spiral perception, narrowing options to acceptance. Cost is legible in "contentment died" protest yielding to "content at last," with agency driving the deepening under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through scalloped stone’s shift from "history" to "possibility," avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights rebirth as "cycle turning on," with no thematic echo—only resonant, non-literal answer to "source of contentment."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature filters mist through "memory," shadows as "aged wine"; syntax mirrors clarity-seeking ("Each branch was a familiar handhold"). "Vineyard hush" motif modulates tone from grief to acceptance without voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "shadows pooled in its recesses with the quality of aged wine" exemplifies high-density prose. Final line "cycle turning on" avoids closure artifacts while recharging "morning mist" with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms rebirth trope through scallop pattern’s causal role: only height reveals spiral, making Mara’s epiphany inevitable. Specificity of "jade pin weathered smooth by countless years" avoids abstraction; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
