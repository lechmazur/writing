<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices (compressing prophecy fragments while seeing prevented futures), but micro-choices lack visible cost escalation beyond the final image; "patient as a shepherd" slightly edges toward stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly—"peculiar kind of peace" crystallizes the cost of containment with conceptual weight, while the brook's resumption of babbling reconfigures the prophecy's dissolution under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The brook functions as indispensable micro-setting, constraining every tactic (channeling sound, carrying fragments) and charging the final image where footprints—and all traces of intervention—vanish into its flow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation through density (prophecy fragments intensifying) is driven purely by the summoner's agency under Accumulative pressure, with the drained wing's crumbling making the conceptual cost of dispersal unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (silencing as weaving), with the final "ember-glow" image offering a resonant, non-literal answer to truth's necessity—no moralizing, only earned ambiguity in "some truths kindest when allowed to remain whispers."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("moths-thoughts," "luminous script") modulates rhythm under pressure; sentence fragments during prophecy bursts ("—the mountain's teeth shall gnaw the—") teach the pattern early and pay off in closure's quiet release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "crystallized moonlight folded into impossible angles" achieves high density without muddle, though "terrestrially cosmic twin" slightly strains coherence in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms prophecy tropes through "silencing" mechanics—dispersing rather than destroying futures—while the summoner's solitude grounds emotional truth; risk-taking (lyric containment) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
