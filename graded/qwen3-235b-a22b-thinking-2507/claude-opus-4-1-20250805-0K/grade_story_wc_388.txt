<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (truth-seeking vs. mercy) manifest in Marcus's reburial choice, but "worldview tilting" veers into label-speak, slightly undermining embodied crisis during the pivotal dig.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: reburial forecloses exposure with visible cost (returning to poisoned world), and the causal lens ("because scientists suppressed truth, he chooses sanctuary") holds unbroken to the final line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Orchard micro-setting charges closure (trees "untouched in bubble of stillness"), but radiation rules lack specificity—dust storms "glowing" yet fruit thrives without showing how soil/plants interact under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally from debunking mission to moral crisis; the approaching dust storm crystallizes Marcus's trade-off (truth for sanctuary), making the cost unmistakable as he walks into the wasteland.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the diamond's flaw ("imperfect heart made everything whole"), avoiding moralizing; the final line reweights "curse" into "choice" without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("Geiger counter clicked lazily") and rhythmic control shine, but "methodically shredded" feels generic, slightly diluting Marcus's observational expertise during letter assembly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops and high density except "soil falling away until his fingers struck" (simultaneity error); otherwise, propulsion and specificity ("frozen lightning bolt" flaw) elevate peak beats without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "cursed gem" trope via scientists' deliberate sacrifice; emotional truth in Marcus's renunciation feels fresh, though wasteland setting leans familiar without deeper world logic.</comment>
