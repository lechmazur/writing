<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s tactile craft and the astronomer’s desperation anchor motivation, but his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses beyond surface-level urgency; the pivotal moment where he breaks breathing pattern reveals value hierarchy yet avoids deeper psychological friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise via the fog-silvered mirror’s permanence, reweighting "boundaries as agreements" with conceptual cost; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through synchronized breathing’s density escalation without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ruined orchard’s salvaged mirrors—charged by fog and time—constrain Elara’s solution and directly charge the final image; "glass mountains" tone absence is irrelevant as fog-crystallized light fulfills micro-setting necessity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when breathing synchronization makes vision permeable yet fragile, with the astronomer’s broken rhythm imposing immediate cost; agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens reweights "capture vs. carry" without coincidence resolving tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through mirrors as active conduits, not abstraction; the final line—"another window through which someone might glimpse the infinite"—resonantly reweights "erasing boundaries" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in Elara’s tactile focus ("fingers reading the curve of glass"), with rhythmic cadence shifts during breathing sequence; fog’s "curious spirits" metaphor avoids cliché through character-particular bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor redundancy in "centuries of thick fog had swallowed entire streets like a living thing" followed by "fog crystallized" slightly dulls propulsion; otherwise high density with zero loops in peak beats like the vision’s dissolution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mirror-making craft with cosmic vision avoids trope reliance; the fog-silvered mirror’s irreplaceable role in carrying dreams transforms "boundary" premise through specific, verifiable detail.</comment>
