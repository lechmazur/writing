<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority shines via embodied ritual (humming lullabies through roots), but Sofia’s emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses; her flawless harmony with mother’s flute slightly idealizes reconciliation without visible struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: hair release during totality reconfigures "ordinary magic" with felt cost (31-year keeping fulfilled), driven by Accumulative/Textural lens where escalating ritual density narrows options toward release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sage Ridge’s micro-setting (wind, temperature drop) charges closure by enabling the curl’s release, but environmental details remain atmospheric rather than constraining choices; "dreaming roots" metaphor lacks causal pressure despite lyrical resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (nurturing wonder through ritual) tighten meaningfully as eclipse approaches, with hair release crystallizing Elena’s lifelong endurance; cost is visible in Sofia’s new melody, though pressure lacks tangible opposition beyond temporal urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through hair ritual, but "love itself was the most softly adaptive force" moralizes in final paragraph, triggering -0.7 penalty for Thematic Echo that undermines earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("copper-bright curl," "shadow bands rippling") modulates perfectly with emotional intensity; rhythmic control during totality ("two minutes and seventeen seconds") deepens pressure without artifact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "luminous, something between copper and gold and starlight" exemplifies high-density lyricism. Slight overwriting in "underground symphony only mothers could hear" risks sentimentality but avoids closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms eclipse trope through specific maternal ritual; "ordinary magic" synthesis feels inevitable. Lacks bold risk-taking—e.g., no exploration of Sofia’s potential skepticism—to reach 9.0+.</comment>
