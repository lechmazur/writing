<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (truth vs legacy) drive choice, but "orbits of regret" thought edges toward abstraction; cost visible in locked nib yet emotional degradation under stress lacks visceral specificity during deduction climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: Tokyo fabrication creates unresolvable truth-orbit with undeniable cost in "goodbye kiss to honesty"; causal lens holds through entire deduction chain without retroactive patches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Observatory functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice—celestial perspective enables remote-meeting realization; brass instruments' "eternal precision" directly pressures her truth calculus and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Margot's agency: journalist's call → deduction → fabrication; cost crystallizes in the sealed letter and locked nib, making integrity's forfeiture viscerally legible under causal escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through orbital metaphor evolving from physical (shadow ellipses) to conceptual (unresolvable truths); final image of "ghosts dancing between contradictions" answers central question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines via astronomy-filtered diction ("clouds below began to glow like old newsprint held to flame"); rhythmic control intensifies during deduction ("pen moved faster now, chasing the contradiction like a comet’s tail").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "rosewood nib seemed to pulse with possibility" demonstrates high density where object, emotion, and stakes fuse; only microscopic filter-verb adjacency in "nature catching how" avoids 9.5+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms legacy drama through celestial mechanics lens; "truth as orbits" premise feels inevitable yet fresh, with risk-taking in making abstract deduction the climax while maintaining emotional weight.</comment>
