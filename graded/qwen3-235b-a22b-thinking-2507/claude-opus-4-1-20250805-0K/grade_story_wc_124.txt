<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority richly embodied through scent-driven memories, but lacks sufficient contradictory impulses in peak transformation; grief-to-purpose shift feels slightly overdetermined without visible struggle against acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost—Elara’s irreversible transformation crystallizes in "tears weren’t endings but translations," holding Accumulative/Textural lens through sensory density escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Greenhouse micro-setting constrains every choice: phantom root systems guide her steps, UV light reveals spectral traces, and empty beds charge the final image where she "was the perfume now."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through perfume’s systematic waves, but escalation leans passive—Elara receives memories rather than actively wrestling with them, slightly blurring agency under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through olfactory specifics: "preservation was just another form of grief" crystallizes in the lantern’s pressed flowers, with final image reweighting loss as luminous growth without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines via scent-centric focalization ("honey-vanilla of extinct Silphium"), with rhythmic control deepening under pressure; UV lamp’s "phosphorescent traces" exemplify voice-motivated pattern teaching.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "tears refracted through crystal shadows, splitting into spectrums" merges image/action, though "systematically" slightly over-explains sensory escalation in one high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Synthesizes scent-memory archiving into fresh emotional calculus; avoids derivative "chosen one" tropes by rooting transformation in maternal legacy and occupational specificity of lantern-brokering.</comment>
