<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Marcus’s quiet resolve versus inherited trauma; embodied micro-choices like dust analysis reveal character under pressure without therapy-speak. Final renunciation of passive vigilance earns closure through causal links to grandmother’s legacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: gathering journals reconfigures options with conceptual cost ("weightless burden"), while Accumulative/Textural lens holds through patterned evidence. Fluorescent’s death and rebirth anchor timing without disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dust motes, mainspring barrel, and buzzing fluorescent constrain choices—dust patterns guide journal discovery, light’s silence triggers ghost appearance. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: tactile dust analysis dominates over visual during crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Marcus’s agency: analyzing dust leads to journals, exposing systemic corruption. Cost is unmistakable in "weightless burden" and ghosts fading, reweighting truth as both liberation and obligation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars—mainspring barrel sabotaged to save lives—not moralizing. Final image ("honest darkness") reweights "cracks" as necessary truth without stating a moral, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful: Marcus notices cable harmonics and dust gradients as a technician. Voice modulates under stress with short syntax ("Thick here, thin there"), while ghost dialogue carries subtext through silence and gesture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "dying wasp trapped in glass" avoids cliché via concrete texture. Sentences vary rhythm to match tension—fluent in discovery, staccato during ghost encounter. Final line’s cadence ("whispered promise") crystallizes closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes elevator mechanics and ghost lore into fresh metaphor for institutional rot. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off: journals hidden in ceiling tiles feel inevitable, not gimmicky, deepening stakes through specific, verifiable detail.</comment>
