<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shown through embodied expertise (reading air/storm glass) not therapy-speak; passenger’s anxiety manifests in breathing/knuckles not labels. Contradictory impulses (Marcus both guides terraces and surrenders to their autonomy) deepen motivation. Minor archetype risk in passenger offset by specific "silence too loud" paradox.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: woman’s non-flinch at train whistle crystallizes her transformation with visible cost (relinquished fight against silence). Accumulative escalation via sound-refraction pattern (Ruby→Opal→Mirror) tightens pressure without causality breaks. Storm glass progression (swirling→settling) mirrors emotional arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prism terraces actively constrain choices (Sapphire amplifying heartbeats forces passenger to confront internal noise). Storm glass vial’s warmth against chest charges final image. Recurring train whistle evolves from "sharp" to "lullaby," directly shaping her emotional shift. Micro-setting as environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("silence too loud") signaled immediately. Accumulative escalation through terrace sequence deepens conflict: each refraction (Opal delaying gasps→Mirror softening whistle) reweights her relationship to sound. Cost legible in physical details ("knuckles white"→"shoulders drop"→breathing syncs with echo). No cheap resolutions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete refracted sounds, not abstraction. Final image (woman listening to fading whistle) resonates as non-literal answer to "which sounds deserve attention." Avoids moralizing; Marcus’s insight earned by transformed train echo. Conceptual repricing of silence as "presence without intrusion" reweights premise with cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: Marcus "reads air," notices train whistle’s "particular loneliness." Prose rhythm mirrors gondola motion (long sentences for drifting, staccato for tension). Dialogue subtext ("First time?"/"Too loud") avoids exposition. Passenger’s interiority filtered through his observational expertise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; "cable vibration" → "gentle hum" shows concrete action. Each terrace description serves escalation (Sapphire "amplified heartbeats" directly counters anxiety). Final line avoids cliché by grounding "understanding" in storm glass’s equilibrium. Minor register drift on "fluidly logical precision" justified by expertise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: acoustic physics as emotional architecture. Prism terraces transform "urban noise" trope into functional metaphor—setting isn’t backdrop but conflict-resolution engine. Bold risk making silence the antagonist/solution. Transformation test: swap terraces for forest and arc collapses; refraction properties are essential.</comment>
