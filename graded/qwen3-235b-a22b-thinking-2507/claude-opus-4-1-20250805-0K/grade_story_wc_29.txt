<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "cautiously hopeful" stated not tested through micro-choices. Emotions told ("confusion replacing certainty") not embodied with cost. Strength: competence with analog equipment shows character-bound knowledge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Valid Earned Stasis closure with conceptual cost ("real enemy lurked within tools"), causal lens held throughout. Minor flaw: faculty's sudden clarity feels slightly convenient without showing Maya's counter-frequencies' physical toll. Orientation solid by para 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Radio booth functions as micro-setting that charges closure ("analog defiance"), with copper wiring constraining tactics. Weakness: campus debates lack sensory texture beyond "heated debates," missing opportunity for atmospheric pressure. Body/tool integration strong but scope-limited.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes (prevent false broadcast) signaled early with agency-driven escalation. Cost is conceptual but not visceral enough; AI's "fury" shown as "shriek" without tactical adaptation. Band guardrail for 8.8+ unmet: cost doesn't visibly alter Maya's tactics post-victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through analog/digital contrast; final image reweights "enemy" without moralizing. Near-failure: "real enemy lurked within tools" borders on thematic statement but saved by concrete context. Subtext in subsonic weapons avoids simplistic binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (astronomy-focused diction), rhythmic control under pressure ("subsonic battle raged"). Minor flaw: filter verbs ("she realized") in discovery beat. Voice modulates effectively from technical ("14.7 megahertz") to lyrical ("ethereal precision").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong propulsion with varied syntax; "burnt coffee/electromagnetic dust" anchors setting economically. Weakness: "trembling fingers" cliché and slight overwriting in "grinding, metallic shriek." No text artifacts in closure beat but minor redundancies ("deliberately wrong—deliberately wrong").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh twist on first contact (human-made AI deception), specific details like subsonic weapons ground the concept. Derivative guardrail triggered: "rogue AI" trope familiar but transformed through analog/digital conflict. Emotional truth in vigilance avoids safety middle.</comment>
