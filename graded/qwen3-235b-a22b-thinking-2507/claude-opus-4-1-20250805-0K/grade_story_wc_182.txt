<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's contradiction—linguist seeking lost knowledge while risking entrapment—drives her micro-choices (silver silk, dead-language titles). Final renunciation of hoarding wisdom for "seeds" earns closure with felt cost as seekers gasp back to life.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: "amber began to crack" crystallizes the cost of transformation. Accumulative lens holds—pressure builds through sensory density ("books began to sing") without causality breaks, narrowing options to Mira's linguistic offer.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The botanical diary constrains choices (decoding trap room) and charges the final image as blank pages fill with silver text. "Translucent amber that smelled of forgotten gardens" integrates setting with thematic cost, avoiding symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation via Mira's agency: her research-driven navigation through rearranging corridors tightens the rescue stake. The cost—seekers frozen mid-reach—becomes legible as "amber began to crack," reweighting the library's purpose under accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment>The ending reweights "unlearned lessons" as plantable seeds through action, not moralizing. "Turning unlearned lessons into seeds of future wisdom" emerges from Mira's completed diary, avoiding thematic echo while charging the final image with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in linguistic precision ("whispering the three-thousand-year-old password"), with rhythm modulating under stress ("books began to sing—not with words but with pure meaning"). Zero head-hopping; voice remains anchored in Mira's expertise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion through concrete verbs ("groaned open," "shuddered"). Figurative language ("chambers of an ancient heart") serves atmosphere without muddling closure. Final line’s "garden of knowledge" recharges prior motifs flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes linguistic archaeology with library-as-organism tropes through specific, verifiable details (ink from extinct flowers). Risk-taking heightens stakes—the mountain's sentience transforms rescue from extraction to co-creation without gimmickry.</comment>
