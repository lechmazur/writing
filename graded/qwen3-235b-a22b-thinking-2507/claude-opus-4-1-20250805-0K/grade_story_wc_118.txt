<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Thrain’s contradictory impulses (preserver vs displaced being) manifest in tactile micro-choices like folding the tapestry, with visible cost in enduring silence. No stock phrasing; embodiment via "reading anxiety in rushed cursive" grounds her flawlessly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "someone had to tend the echo" crystallizes humanity’s absence as necessary. Accumulative lens holds—diary discoveries tighten pressure toward the axis revelation, with the final image charging stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The silo’s walls actively constrain choices (absorbing whispers, enabling navigation by echo) and charge the closure: "walls dense with listening" reweights the setting as a living archive. Micro-setting (tactile diaries, tapestry) directly shapes the CR.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Thrain’s agency—probing diaries reveals the axis shift, forcing her endurance as keeper. Cost is legible in "why she’d been left behind," with the displacement cycle creating irreversible, conceptual forfeiture of human dreams.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "bronze quiet" evolves from atmosphere to "space between heartbeats" in the final image, avoiding moralizing. The tapestry’s reweighted meaning delivers a resonant answer to existential displacement without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "breath misting in cold air that tasted of old paper" filters world through Thrain’s sensory attunement. Rhythmic control shifts from lyrical discovery to crystalline realization, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "diaries lay scattered like broken birds" merges image and momentum. One minor scaffold ("vivid despite centuries of decay") slightly dilutes density, but closure lines ("patient as stone") recharge motifs without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms apocalypse tropes via specific lens: dragons as stellar markers, silence as cyclical "pause." Emotional truth in Thrain’s quiet endurance avoids generic bleakness, with the axis displacement feeling inevitable through prior particulars.</comment>
