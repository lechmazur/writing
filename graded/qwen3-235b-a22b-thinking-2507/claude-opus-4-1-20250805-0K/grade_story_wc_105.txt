<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (scientific rigor vs. emotional quest) act simultaneously in the forge scene; cellular metaphor embodies grief as irreversible biological change. Grandfather’s trauma motivates her micro-choices (adjusting prototype, pressing palm to ash) without therapy-speak. Only minor flaw: his off-page presence limits relationship crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a flawless Conceptual Repricing: "sound of trust breaking indistinguishable from trust being born" reweights the premise with cellular cost ("cells divided and renewed"). Accumulative lens holds—aurora’s shifting colors deepen the stake. Minor deduction: shipwreck groan feels coincidental, not pressure-driven escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse constrains choices (pressurized chamber, corrosion limiting forge use) and charges the final image (palm on ash). Apple trees as "drowning hands" mirror her emotional state through action. Shipwrecks slightly ornamental but justified by cellular betrayal motif. Meets 9+ gate via tool (forge) charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding trust’s frequency) tightens through cellular deepening—each division a "small betrayal." Protagonist agency drives escalation (notebook discovery → imprinting process). Cost is undeniable in the final image’s cellular memory. Deduction: shipwrecks introduce external pressure without altering her tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: cellular division as broken promises, absence as sound. Final image ("roots releasing soil") offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids false balance—trust’s duality is earned through synesthesia’s physicality. No thematic echo; wisdom arises from apple trees swaying in currents.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: synesthesia filters all description ("aurora shifted to violet, heard as low thrumming"). Rhythm modulates under pressure (short sentences during forge work). Minor flaw: "tumors of stress" borders on diagnostic label but redeemed by immediate cellular imagery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "branches reaching upward like drowning hands" achieves high density. "Stolen shanties" crystallizes absence with propulsion. Deduction: "tumors of stress" slightly muddles the cellular metaphor in one line, but doesn’t dull closure’s "battered marvel" payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms hearing loss trope through synesthesia and cellular metaphors. "Absence as sound" is fresh synthesis—shipwrecks’ "stolen shanties" reweights the premise organically. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes; emotional truth in "slow exhale" of trust breaking. No derivative elements.</comment>
