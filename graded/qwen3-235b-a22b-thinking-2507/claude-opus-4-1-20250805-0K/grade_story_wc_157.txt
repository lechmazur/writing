<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (scientific precision vs rebellion) manifest in micro-choices like Marcus releasing specific insects. Serena's "ecosystem" line crystallizes earned endurance with felt cost in the locusts' sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: locusts registering as "rain" reconfigures defiance's cost while maintaining pressure. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through wing-beat patterns intensifying to conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Greenhouse setting constrains every choice (beetles as white noise, mantises as false positives). Final image of "soil that recognizes no authority but the sun" charges the micro-setting through persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via Marcus's agency: each insect release narrows options while raising cost. "Tomatoes" line grounds abstract stakes, with locusts' alien consciousness paying conceptual price visible in Auditor scanners.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "Consciousness is not commodity" becomes embodied in marigolds, then reweighted by locusts' "rain" misreading. Final line's "chaos... grammar" avoids moralizing while resonating.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV filters all perception through entomological lens ("beetle-track script," neural patterns). Serena's dialogue carries subtext via seed-handling; stress compresses syntax during Auditor pounding without voice slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; "photosynthetic rebellion" risks cliché but earns specificity through garden mechanics. Final paragraph's cadence shift ("door burst open... smiled") delivers propulsion without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms dystopian tropes through entomological resistance. "Reading tomatoes" synthesizes premise into fresh emotional truth; chaos-as-grammar payoff grows organically from wing-beat interference established in opening line.</comment>
