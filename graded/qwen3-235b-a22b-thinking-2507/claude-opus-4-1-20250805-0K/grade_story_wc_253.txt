<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-choices crystallize Mrs. Chen's shift: extending the bouquet, touching the crumbling petal, practicing narration. Performer's void-as-tool avoids sentimentality but "lightness without forgetting" borders on diagnostic phrasing mid-beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "it crumbled, but somehow the destruction felt like release" crystallizes the cost. Turbines' mechanical hum vs. remade hush reconfigures the mandate's power with conceptual cost. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Turbine shadows as "dark clock hands" pressure the scene, but farmhouse setting remains atmospheric rather than constraining choices. Whittling wood grain and brittle flowers charge the final image yet lack mid-scene tactical influence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation through narration deepening: from knife selection to potato-peeling promise. Mrs. Chen's petal-touch choice pays visible cost (crumbling = release), narrowing options to "carry sorrow differently" under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "lighter. Not happier" reweights grief as resistance. Avoids moralizing but "lightness without forgetting" is slightly over-articulated early, softening the earned CR.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Performer's flat narration creates profound subtext ("shadows shaped like memories"), but Mrs. Chen's "she understood" abstractions disrupt POV modesty. Rhythmic control under pressure nearly flawless.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Empty as winter sky" cliché slightly dulls the opening. Otherwise, zero loops; "eternal whisper-roar" and "crumbled... felt like release" achieve high density. Final line’s propulsion impeccable.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via whittling-as-resistance method. Wind turbines as grief metaphor feels fresh, though "Happiness Mandate" echoes familiar dystopias. Emotional truth anchors the risk-taking.</comment>
