<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "sensibly eccentric" vs. transcendent yearning; micro-choices like trembling vial uncorking reveal hierarchy of values. Final renunciation earned by prior causality (caution vs. Hartley's fate), but flaw manifestation lacks visible struggle during psychometry vision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with escalating sensory density (phosphorescent glow → spinning compass → rippling water) culminating in Charged Poise closure. Cost unmistakable in "someday, when she was ready," though before/after legibility slightly soft without explicit stance crystallization beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Limestone cliffs and lagoon constrain every choice (descent path, compass vision location) and charge the final image ("memory of impossible rain" in vial). Micro-setting mastery: compass's brass surface and clinking vials become tactile decision-points under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake ("place where explanations fail") signaled by 15% mark; escalation driven solely by Vera's agency (interpreting compass, choosing delay). Cost legible in deferred transcendence ("someday, when ready"), though tightening slightly late in Accumulative design.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: petrichor as memory carrier reweights "hinged awakenings" into cosmic portal. Final image ("ordinary air" vs. vial's "impossible rain") delivers non-literal answer without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite high concept density.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in scent-layer noticing ("mineral dampness," "rains that fell on distant worlds"). Rhythmic control peaks during vision sequence with purposeful compression; psychic distance shifts cleanly from scientific observation to transcendent awe.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "mirror-still, reflecting stalactites that hung like frozen rain" achieves triple duty (sensory, atmosphere, foreshadowing). Final line recharges opening with devastating economy ("factory dust and ordinary air" vs. "resonant hush").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms portal fantasy via petrichor collector lens: scientific framing (psychometry) meets mystical experience. Risk-taking in scent-based revelation feels inevitable, though "hinged awakenings" concept edges close to familiar mystical tropes without full transformation.</comment>
