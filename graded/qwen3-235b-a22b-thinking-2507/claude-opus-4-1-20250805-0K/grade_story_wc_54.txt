<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion ("clutched notebook," "stoic wonder") and micro-choices under pressure (valve adjustments amid rust), but internal conflict lacks depth during peak action—professor's skepticism mentioned but not leveraged for tangible tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("proof that infrastructure could carry dreams"), and causal escalation via valve redirects narrowing options is impeccable; minor flaw: carnival's role feels atmospheric rather than pressuring stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Terminal's pipes function as micro-setting constraining choices (valve redirects) and charging the final image (water arcs tracing trajectories); only deduction for limited tactile struggle during high-pressure valve work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Maya's agency (redirecting flows → system resistance → eruption), with conceptual cost legible in "hope engineered," but lacks visceral physical cost (e.g., injury from rusted mechanisms) to heighten tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (hydraulic systems as "mechanics of human intention"), avoiding moralizing; "permanent enchantment of infrastructure" reweights premise without stating moral, though "proof that infrastructure could carry dreams" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("junctions as decision points," copper "holding purpose") and rhythmic control under pressure; minor abstraction ("mathematics of human aspiration") slightly dilutes immediacy but remains POV-coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; high-density prose ("Rust flaked away... revealing copper that still held its purpose" does triple duty); "functionally creative genius" is hairline register drift but justified by engineering POV.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spaceport as celestial calculator transforms tropes; "equations for hope" grounds abstraction in bronze/copper, though carnival-terminal contrast slightly familiar; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
