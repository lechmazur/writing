<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eliza's contradictory impulses ("hands made for destruction" yet mending) and embodied grief (hands stilled, comparing sketches) earn high marks; Marcus's motivation slightly externalized through chaplain backstory rather than visceral interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "maybe we deserve better than carrying his breaks forever" reconfigures stakes with visible cost in the ticking heart; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds consistently through repair process.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Music box shop functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (tool selection, light-dependent work) and charges closure; "crystal windows catching light" evolves from atmospheric detail to thematic amplifier during the final melody.</comment>
<question>4</question><question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake tightening occurs organically through repair process: Eliza's "calm before realization" beat narrows options to mending or rejecting, with cost embodied in her whispered admission that Thomas "always broke things."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "transform an apology into action, one careful repair at a time" avoids moralizing; final image of the clockwork heart beating "steady as absolution" reweights forgiveness without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines (Eliza notices wire gauge, not storm clouds); rhythmic control peaks during repair sequence with purposeful compression ("soft click of gears finding their place"); minor register drift in "aptly deliberate precision."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fractured beams illuminating frozen dancers" achieves textural density without muddle; only debatable line ("truth hovers unspoken") remains anchored by physical stillness of hands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "apology object" trope through mechanical specificity; emotional truth in "inherited grace" versus Thomas's "hands made for destruction" avoids redemption clichés while deepening universality.</comment>
