<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Marcus's calculated hope ("hope was poorly calculated probability") but Sarah's memory blurs into thematic abstraction rather than embodied loss; the chipped die's texture anchors emotion better than the "missed opportunity" concept.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise—the snake eyes prophecy crystallizes mathematical inevitability with conceptual cost (staircase = lifespan loop)—but the 17-billion-step revelation feels retroactively convenient rather than earned through prior causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The infinite staircase isn't backdrop but active constraint: each roll's gravity defiance and step count dictate Marcus's tactics; the dice chip evolves from tool to symbolic anchor that charges the final image of rupture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Marcus's agency: his deliberate dice-chipping escalates the loop's rupture probability, narrowing options to "patient urgency" as entropy manifests in the chip's growth—visible cost in every roll's altered deviation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through math-as-theology ("proofs became prophecy") and the chipped die's "necessary discontinuity," avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights perpetual motion as human-scale tragedy without stating it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("probability itself had fractured") shines, but "measured recklessness" and "grim optimist" drift into clinical abstraction under peak stress, slightly dulling visceral immediacy in pivotal beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "defying gravity's conventional wisdom" exemplifies precise propulsion. Minor flaw: "texture of the missed opportunity" uses abstract noun where embodied sensation would heighten the rupture anticipation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms mathematical tropes through specific human calculus—the staircase's 17-billion-step loop equating to Sarah's lifespan creates fresh emotional geometry; risk-taking (math as theology) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
