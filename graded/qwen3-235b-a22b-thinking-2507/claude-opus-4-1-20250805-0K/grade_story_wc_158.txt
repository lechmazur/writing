<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via insomnia as curse/blessing; "cracked voice" embodies emotion without labels. Micro-choice handling of dissolving postcard charges final image with cost. Near-perfect embodiment avoids therapy-speak despite high-concept premise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "galaxy postcard has nearly dissolved" crystallizes the poet's earned stasis. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—density increase via arriving creators reweights "blossom armistice" from idea to living ecosystem with felt stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Shell functions as micro-setting: its "calcium spirals" and "perpetual twilight" constrain choices (writing on walls) and charge closure ("worn things become instruments of illumination"). Sensory details like "charcoal made from burned poems" avoid white-room syndrome while reflecting urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: her "half-sung lullabies" organically attract wounded creators, tightening options through density increase. Cost legible in postcard's dissolution, but "wars ended through exhaustion" slightly tells rather than shows the transformation under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "crystallized music" gardens and "wounded light" imagery—no moralizing. Final image reweights "approaching disasters" as "slow dances" via the dissolving postcard, avoiding binaries. Near-slippage in "beauty and pain learned to coexist" saved by "ancient dance" metaphor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "reef-shadow joy where darkness wasn't absence but presence." Rhythmic control under pressure: "shyly unstoppable" repetition mirrors lullaby fragments. Zero head-hopping; compression taught early via "three lifetimes" and paid off in closure's temporal density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "shrapnel of longing" and "nutritiously complex" earn their weight through concrete setup. Final line’s cadence ("imperfect music is still music") delivers propulsion. Minor overwriting in "photosynthesize into something that could sustain" barely dents otherwise flawless density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes insomnia, shell architecture, and galaxy postcard into inevitable "reef-shadow joy" vision. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes—no causal turns needed. "Wounded light still illuminates" transforms cliché into fresh emotional truth without derivative echoes.</comment>
