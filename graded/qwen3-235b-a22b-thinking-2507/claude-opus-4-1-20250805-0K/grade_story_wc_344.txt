<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (ambition vs craft) manifests in embodied choices like gear arrangement; flaw-driven failure (celestial vault) directly motivates present action. Epiphany avoids diagnostic labels but slightly over-tidies the internal conflict resolution at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: village darkness below and three-month wait crystallize stakes. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—prophecy fragments deepen meaning without causal gaps. Minor tension in library's shift to transparency slightly blurs spatial cause.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen library functions as micro-setting: ice-slick floor mutes footsteps, mirrors constrain choices by forcing self-confrontation. "Singing gears" evolve from carried object to teachers, charging the final descent. Sensory details (salt-taste, silk-hush) reflect urgency without checklist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repair rhythm) tightens through prophecy revelations, but escalation leans slightly on coincidence (gears humming). Protagonist agency shines in gear configuration choice, yet the "three months" cost feels more implied than viscerally dramatized in the beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "rhythm of repair" reframes ambition as patience. Final image ("driftwood holds memory of sea") resonates without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo, though "breaking/mending" insight edges toward slight abstraction at the podium beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exquisite: "words swam," "tasted of salt," tools as emotional anchors. Voice modulates from hushed library calm to gear-humming intensity without register drift. Zero head-hopping; compression taught early pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "brass wheels sang when wind touched them" demonstrates multi-jobbing prose. Only minor artifact: "ghostly forms bent over texts that no longer existed except here" has slight redundancy. Closure beat ("listen to locks") achieves crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "eclipse locksmith" trope through specific mechanics (tumblers as conversation). Fresh inflection in "rhythm of repair" reframing, though celestial vault premise edges toward familiar. Risk-taking in lyric compression elevates without gimmickry.</comment>
