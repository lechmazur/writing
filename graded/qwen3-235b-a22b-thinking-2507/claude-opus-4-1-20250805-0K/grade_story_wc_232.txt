<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (seller vs traveler) act simultaneously in the creek-rising moment; the final shift earns visible cost through embodied specificity ("no longer someone who only sold maps"). Slight over-reliance on labeled intuition ("empirically intuitive nature") without deeper struggle during the pivotal decision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: Marcus's identity shift ("no longer someone who only sold maps") crystallizes options under Accumulative/Textural lens. The creek's rise serves as atmospheric pressure but lacks tight clock mechanics for full escalation credit. Lens clarity (Accumulative) holds from midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The matrix chip functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (activating the doorway) and charging the final image (cool in pocket). Cavern's "crystalline pools reflecting scenes that weren't there" concretely pressures Marcus's understanding of choice topology without symbolic shouting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Marcus's agency (following ants) narrows options under Accumulative lens, with cost unmistakable in identity shift. "Creek rising" timeframe remains atmospheric rather than tactical pressure—misses live-clock tightening that would elevate to 9.0 band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the matrix chip's evolution: from forgotten object to tool for "printing new legends." Final image reweights opening ("selling other people's journeys") with no moralizing—pure resonance via "ready to chart territories that existed only after someone was brave enough to seek them."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cartographer's fingers traced routes," "topology of choices") modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control shines in the cavern discovery: short clauses ("The ants disappeared inside") accelerate into lyrical density ("air tasted of minerals and promises"). Zero head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence multiplies meaning ("crystalline pools reflected scenes that weren't there—or weren't there yet"). Final line's "creek was already falling" echoes opening with profound reweighting. Near-flawless propulsion through high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "magical journey" trope through cartographic specificity (matrix chip as map-reader, not maker). Risk-taking heightens stakes: abstract "doorway of decisions" made tangible via topology, avoiding gimmickry. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
