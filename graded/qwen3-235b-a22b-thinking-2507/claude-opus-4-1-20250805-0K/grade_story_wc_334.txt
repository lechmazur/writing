<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Margaret's chronic curiosity manifests in concrete actions (detecting patterns, cross-referencing sketches), not labels. Her internal conflict crystallizes when realizing she's Gran's "backup plan," with the earned cost being her irreversible absorption of communal trauma. Flaw: Contradictory impulses (recovery vs. dread) aren't simultaneously active in the climax beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: "her mind heavy with recovered histories" concretizes the cost while reconfiguring the shipwrecks from monuments to stories she now carries. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—the constellation pattern deepens pressure until the ring's dimming signifies the vigil's end. No orientation debt; lens clarity by paragraph 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse isn't backdrop but active constraint: barnacles and squelching floor force navigation choices, while the recurring mushroom directly charges the closure (placed center-ring to trigger memory flow). Shipwrecks evolve from scenery to named vessels ("Remembrance," "Chronicle") that Margaret literally carries forward, meeting the 9+ gate for environment charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Margaret's agency: her folklorist skills drive the pattern recognition ("Each shattered constellation marked..."), culminating in the crystallizing realization that she's Gran's backup plan—a trade-off foreclosing simple recovery. Cost is visceral in "mind heavy with recovered histories," though the escalation lacks one visible tactical shift (e.g., altered approach mid-ring).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through charged particulars: shipwrecks as "monuments to those who'd paid the price" and the final image of Margaret carrying stories reframes "some prices are too high to pay" without moralizing. Avoids binaries by honoring Gran's complex choice while condemning the system, with the amber-shadowed fruit jars embodying preserved-but-lost knowledge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in folklorist-specific noticing ("Orion, but wrong—his belt curved impossibly"), and syntax tightens under pressure ("She reached into the ring"). Minor flaw: "salt-thick air" announcement lacks character-distinct phrasing. Rhythmic control nearly flawless but misses 9+ due to slight abstraction in "recovered histories" during peak tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with zero loops; "mason jars of preserved fruit, their contents long since turned to amber shadows" exemplifies textural specificity. Final image ("sunken orchard had given back... she would ensure these memories lived on") avoids sentimentality. Deducted 0.2 for "mind heavy with recovered histories" bordering on abstraction in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of folklore with ecological grief: shipwrecks as carved names ("Testimony") transform amnesia tropes into communal cost. Specificity elevates ("net-mender's fingers fumble familiar knots"), avoiding generality. Risk-taking (memory-as-jellyfish) heightens stakes coherently, though the fairy ring mechanism edges toward familiar myth without sufficient transformation.</comment>
