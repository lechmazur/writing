<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in micro-choices (counting steps while grieving), but the "featherly determined" trait lacks visible tradeoffs despite two mentions. Final kneeling choice earns closure through embodied cost (three-degree temperature differential), though flaw integration could deepen.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "perpetual transition" soil reconfigures absence/presence with conceptual cost ("three degrees cooler"). Orientation anchors by para 2, Accumulative lens holds through pressure-differential escalation. Minor deduction: logbook feels slightly convenient as sole navigation tool.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains every choice: seven-foot rows = father's arm span, prism terrace enables discovery. Corn's "fractured hush" evolves from whisper to exhalation, charging the final image. Micro-setting mastery—wood grain analysis directly enables center revelation—clears 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: Marina's navigation (left at pressure differentials) forecloses escape paths. Cost is visceral in the soil's "permanent pressure differential," but escalation lacks one meaningful deepening—logbook reliance slightly outsources tension versus earned knowledge shifts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "necessary distance" reweights from arm spans to love's physics. Final whisper ("love itself is a necessary distance") avoids moralizing by charging prior material. No thematic echo—resonance lives in soil temperature, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels (weather codes as emotional language), but "featherly determined" repeats with minimal variation under stress. Voice modulates beautifully from analytical ("analyzing grain patterns") to lyrical ("corn exhaled"), though minor register drift in "sacred geometry of loss" slightly jars.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fractured hush" evolves meaningfully across beats. Final image ("rainbow shadows through corridors") delivers crystalline propulsion. Minor deduction: "featherly determined" borders on mannered repetition, but never muddles closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms maze trope through meteorological intimacy—"necessary distances" as emotional physics feels inevitable. Bold risk: weather codes as grief language avoids sentimentality via corn-stalk thermodynamics. Freshness lives in soil temperature as sacred metric, not symbolic convenience.</comment>
