<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: Marcus's abrasive calm cracks at the cogs, revealing vulnerability without labels. Historian's motivation ("world not ready") feels earned through grandfather's journal, though her flaw isn't actively demonstrated in-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the journal's "heavier than water-soaked leather" crystallizes conceptual cost of truth-preservation. Causal escalation holds perfectly—Marcus's cog challenge forces historian's confession, narrowing options to dangerous collaboration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken city actively pressures choices: diving gear necessity, green-tinted water visibility, and the fifteen-foot seawater depth directly constrain tactics. The chronometer cog as micro-setting charges the final image through Marcus's recognition of its configuration.</comment>
<question>4</question><question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single escalation beat powerfully narrows options: Marcus's evidence triggers historian's admission, making collaboration the only path with visible cost (cracked composure, descent into danger). Dominant stake (truth preservation method) is consistently tested through sedimentary debate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sediment metaphor without moralizing; final descent reweights "competing narratives" as active preservation. Avoids thematic echo—the historian's "time itself can have competing narratives" serves character backstory, not authorial sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp ("barnacles creep across marble statues through green-tinted water"). Compression taught early ("plague had receded like a tide") pays off in lean, pressure-cooked dialogue. Minor register drift in "rational rebellion" barely touches cohesion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "heavier than water-soaked leather should be" shows conceptual weight instead of telling. Every sentence advances momentum, with cadence tightening during the cog confrontation. Near-flawless density under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms historian/local trope through specific mechanics (cog metallurgy debate) and bold structural choice—no exposition dumps, only active truth concealment. Emotional specificity in Marcus's three-year solitude avoids generic rebellion clichés.</comment>
