<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Thomas's grief lacks embodied specificity beyond "shoulders hunched"; Mira's silent motivation is profound but Thomas's internal contradiction (wanting to speak vs frozen words) isn't physically manifested. Dental mirror use concretely reveals character under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Thomas's "breathing in rhythm with the canal" crystallizes stance crystallization with felt cost ("secret dissolved like stone"). Accumulative lens holds through shutter patterns reweighting darkness. Cost proof in "dissolve" moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dental mirror functions as micro-setting that constrains every choice (must reflect light via shutters) and charges the final image ("smallest reflective surface...vastness"). Cobalt dock's puddles actively supply resources for the closure's star reflections.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through shutter patterns (darkness→single star→constellations) under Accumulative lens, but Thomas's agency feels passive; the cost ("stone dissolving") lacks tangible trade-off. Dominant stake signaled early via "unfinished confessions".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final line "darkness teaches us to treasure light" offers resonant non-literal answer through prior particulars (shutter patterns). Theme emerges from dental mirror's transformation into "telescope into the past" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Spiralingly calm" establishes distinct perceptual signature; rhythmic control shines in "water circling a drain in reverse" compression. Minor register drift in "stillwater tension" slightly jars established voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Water circling a drain in reverse" creates mixed metaphor (drains don't reverse); otherwise zero loops with high density. "Breathing in rhythm with the canal" borders cliché but saved by concrete context. Final line's propulsion is flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "silent empathy" trope through dental mirror's physical constraints; shutter patterns feel inevitable. Risk-taking (no dialogue) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Freshness in "lighthouse casting miniature constellations" specificity.</comment>
