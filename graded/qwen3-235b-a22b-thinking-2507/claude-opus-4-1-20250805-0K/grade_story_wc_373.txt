<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in micro-choices (fob reveal), but "trust breaking sounded like drowning in reverse" edges toward abstract interiority. Embodied emotion strong through fob's weight shift during betrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly—"weight forever changed" crystallizes exile cost. Minor lens slip: "truce of hush" explanation slightly expositional, though payoff in "tide changes" ultimatum anchors Hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Watch fob functions as micro-setting, constraining the climax (badge discovery) and charging the final image. "Wool blanket soaked in seawater" elevates atmospheric specificity beyond generic lawlessness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally through protagonist agency: failed infiltrations → bloodline gambit → badge discovery. Cost legible in "never return" exile, though "someone's been recording" dialogue slightly telegraphs tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through fob's duality (heirloom/badge), not statement. Final line reweights "breaking" via prior struggle—no moralizing, just the "echo of broken trust" resonating with earned cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct ("tide's rhythm through rotting wood"), rhythmic control tightens under stress. "Drowning in reverse" slightly abstract, but compression ("truce of hush") taught early pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion—"rotting pier gold" final line recharges motifs. Minor overwriting in "trust breaking sounded like recognition. Like drowning in reverse" slightly muddles peak-beat clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "sound of trust breaking" motif transforms infiltration tropes. Emotional specificity in father's legacy avoids abstraction—market's "comforting unease" feels lived-in, not conceptual.</comment>
