<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in mask removal after seven years; embodied scars reveal cost without therapy-speak. Marcus feels underdeveloped, slightly weakening relationship-as-crucible under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost (mask removal/scars) under Accumulative lens; parapet's responsive motion reweights stakes. Midpoint lens clarity avoids ambiguity cap.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kinetic parapet evolves from defense to memory vessel, constraining choices and charging the finale's "eternal dance." Murmuring pavilion's breathfield hum directly shapes consecration tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when clearings "dim," forcing urgent consecration; cost is exhaustion and identity forfeiture. Prophet's arrival creates pressure but timeframe lacks live-clock urgency for full 9-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete acts: consecration as "gift to time" avoids moralizing. Final image reweights "boundaries" as necessary for wisdom's resonance without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "exposed eye tracking horizon" and "whisperfield calm" modulates under pressure. Slight register drift in "measured cadence of one who walks between certainties" dilutes voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Strangely honest" label in Q9D triggers diagnostic penalty; "flickering like stars against obsidian" risks purple prose. Zero loops but minor figurative muddle in high-pressure consecration beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of boundary-walking as preservation ritual; kinetic parapet transforms tropes through sand-memory mechanics. Avoids safety-middle with morally ambiguous "guarding against forgetting itself."</comment>
