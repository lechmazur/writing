<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (limitation as gift) act in scene; closure earned through her transcendent realization about identity's forms. Final choice to craft spatially forecloses visual art with felt cost of the library's destruction, avoiding epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost in "The library would fall, but its face... would endure." Accumulative lens deepens the stake through sensory accumulation without causal turns, maintaining coherence to the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The coin functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (mirror placement via spiral pattern) and charges the final image (tucked away with sky metaphor). Tactile details like "ladder marks in the bark" evolve causally with her actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Lyra's agency in discovering the coin's meaning and transcending her limits, reweighting the stake from preservation to continuity. Cost is unmistakable in the demolition's approach and her walking away.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the coin's face-map and spatial portrait, avoiding moralizing. Final image "carrying the sky inside her own walls" offers resonant answer to continuity without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (touch-focused descriptions like "read the truth of features through touch") modulates rhythm under pressure. Elision of guild history taught early via coin and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with "fractally precise detail" advancing character and plot. Final line’s metaphor avoids muddle while charging closure, with sentence variation matching emotional cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Face-blindness transforms the library-as-face trope into fresh synthesis; the coin’s face-map reconfigures identity. Risk-taking with spatial portraiture heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
