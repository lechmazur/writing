<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina’s contradictory impulses (skepticism vs belief in magic) drive micro-choices under pressure, culminating in an earned integration choice with visible cost: "carrying both her grief and her grace" forecloses the Institute’s path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: dawn transformation reconfigures "tragically radiant" into "fully herself" with undeniable conceptual cost ("whole but scarred" shell), sustained under Accumulative/Textural lens through sensory density escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The velvet garden actively constrains choices (petals guiding her path, perfume triggering memories) and charges the final image ("dawn painted it gold"), with the seashell functioning as micro-setting that dictates digging location and closure resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Marina’s agency alone: whispers evolving from fragments to coordinates forces a single deepening choice (digging), narrowing options from passive listening to active reclamation with felt cost in the scarred shell’s silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars—no moralizing—culminating in the resonant final image ("memories learning to dance") that reweights the core conflict without stating a moral, avoiding all thematic echo pitfalls.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("velvet petals so dark they seemed to absorb light") and rhythmic control under pressure (compressed syntax during digging: "dirt collecting under fingernails like inverse stars") with zero head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances story ("resonance structures that shouldn’t exist" does triple duty: action, sensory detail, thematic resonance), with figurative language ("inverse stars") precise and payoff-driven in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "quarantined memory" trope through specific, grounded details (calcium carbonate lattices, "tragically radiant" diagnosis), with bold risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightening emotional stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
