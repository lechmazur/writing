<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "wealthy in her poverty" realization; micro-choices (bottle openings) reveal value hierarchy. Slight over-articulation in "understood now why the old woman..." risks diagnostic label-speak but avoids penalty through embodied cost ("gritty smoothness of change").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "black sand held her imprint—not of a body, but of a moment" crystallizes cost with undeniable pressure. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density increase; planetary alignment tightens options without causal breaks. Cost proof: "particles glowing like bottled lightning" makes dissolution visceral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Black sand functions as micro-setting that charges closure—it becomes the canvas for Elara's "imprint" and mirrors transformation ("gritty smoothness"). Volcanic heat actively constrains choices (bugs pulse faster), fulfilling 9+ gate requirement. No ornamental details; every texture serves the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency: Elara's bottle openings narrow options toward dissolution. Pressure coheres via Accumulative lens—synchronized bugs and planetary alignment reweight "texture" as tangible cost. Visible price (cellular restructuring) alters tactics; "possessions were weight" crystallizes the trade-off cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: giving away ships/fortune enables transformation, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("lightning bugs carried her consciousness... orchestrating small coincidences") delivers non-literal answer to "texture" question. Resists binaries via "wealthy in her poverty," with ambiguity in whether planets or self drives change.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in texture-focused noticing ("silk becoming iron becoming starlight"); rhythm modulates under pressure (short sentences during transformation). Minor repetition in "vibrant hush" descriptions slightly dulls immediacy, but elision of backstory ("storm that forced her ship") is taught and paid off through causality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "gritty smoothness of change" exemplifies high-density prose doing triple duty (image/action/theme). Final line "gritty, smooth, and absolutely complete" crystallizes closure without muddle. Slight register drift in "orchestrating small coincidences" avoids penalty through voice consistency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms cosmic-transformation tropes through specific, grounded details: lightning bugs as consciousness carriers, planetary gravity affecting lava flow. Emotional truth in destitute philanthropist seeking transcendence via poverty. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure remains legible.</comment>
