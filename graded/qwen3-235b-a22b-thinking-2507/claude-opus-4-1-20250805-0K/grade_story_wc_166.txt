<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (isolation vs artistic legacy) drive the climax; final renunciation of safety earned through embodied micro-choices like withdrawing the moonstone dust. Slight flaw: minimal exploration of how exile reshaped her physicality beyond grace.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with unmistakable cost: "by dawn, the authorities would detect... but tonight she was eternal" crystallizes the trade-off. Accumulative lens holds through intensifying luminosity and dawn's approach without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Garden functions as micro-setting: dew-slicked stones constrain movement, wisteria blooms become constellation maps that charge the final image. Body (skin as cosmic canvas) directly shapes the closure's cost and consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mira's agency—her dance intensifies the luminosity, narrowing options as dawn approaches. Cost is legible in "by dawn... authorities would detect," with the moonstone dust's transformation directly enabling the capture risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory as resistance emerges through concrete actions (dust seeding soil), not abstraction. Final image reweights "exile" into "expansion," offering a resonant answer without moralizing—no character articulates the thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in noticing "gaps between heartbeats" and lunar rhythms; syntax compresses under pressure ("She began to dance. Not the sanctioned movements..."). Patterned elision of backstory taught early and paid off in the dust ritual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "luminous threads wrapped like ancient script" does triple duty. Figurative language remains precise even in climax ("skin became a canvas of swirling nebulae"), with rhythm accelerating through short clauses as dawn nears.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms exile trope through "fledging" as becoming a living document. Specific details (wisteria pulsing with lunar rhythm) ground the cosmic defiance, while the moonstone dust's evolution avoids symbolic convenience through causal pressure.</comment>
