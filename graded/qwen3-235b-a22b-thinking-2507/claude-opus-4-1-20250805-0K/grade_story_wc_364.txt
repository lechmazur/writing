<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Meekness-as-listening manifests in concrete choices ("Where others demanded, he invited"), but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure. Merchant's change is powerful yet reactive rather than active, limiting micro-choice depth despite strong embodied emotion in the trembling recognition scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise through the merchant's visceral recognition of "memories of dreams he'd sold," with undeniable conceptual cost in his dissolved ability to rest. Accumulative lens holds perfectly as silk's transformation reconfigures meaning without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Floating stone arches actively constrain choices (necessitating mine descent for "reality-thin" chambers) and charge the final image: upward-falling cherry blossoms crystallize Korin's "falling isn't failure" philosophy, meeting the 9+ gate requirement decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate purely through Accumulative pressure—each hammer strike accumulates meaning until the blade "sang with azure defiance." Merchant's trembling fingers make the cost of bartered consciousness viscerally felt, though the single tightening lacks a second micro-turn for 9.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: silk's "patterns of bartered awakenings" and blade as "instrument of recovery." Final blossoms offer non-literal answer to resilience, but Korin's "falling isn't failure" line edges toward thematic echo, slightly diluting earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("metal remembered everything") and rhythmic control shine in high-pressure beats ("The silk guided him through darkness"). Zero head-hopping; merchant's sparse dialogue carries devastating subtext through the "How?" whisper amid crystallized stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; strategic telling compresses time ("Hours passed, or perhaps days") without momentum loss. Minor redundancy in "azure defiance" (appearing in blade description and merchant's recognition) prevents 9.5+, but never dulls closure's charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "bartered dreams" trope through tangible silk woven from "dreams of those who'd forgotten how to wake." Risk-taking (lyric structure, no antagonist) heightens stakes via miner scars vs. Korin's success, with emotional specificity in "slow dissolution of ability to truly rest."</comment>
