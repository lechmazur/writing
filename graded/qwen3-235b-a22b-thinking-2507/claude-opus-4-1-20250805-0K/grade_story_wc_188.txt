<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kaia's pyrotechnic lens as embodied contradiction ("filtering chaos into patterns") drives every micro-choice under pressure, with visible cost in the brittle laughter she senses. The mosaic artist's secondary pressure crystallizes her shift from solitary designer to community catalyst without flattening either character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the sustained rocket bursts reconfigure "hope" from kerosene knot to communal defiance against starless void, with cost legible in children's "brittle" laughter transforming into dance. Lens ambiguity cap avoided by Accumulative/Textural escalation holding through the "hush" deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Phosphorescent moss functions as micro-setting constraint—yielding green pigment for rockets—and charges the final image ("fortress bloomed differently"). Oilcloth-wrapped rag knot and ceramic tiles actively shape choices, avoiding white-room syndrome through tactile, lived-in navigation of the mosaic courtyard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through communal action: Kaia's "slow and steady" kerosene solution transforms despair into sustained light, narrowing options from individual survival to collective creation. Cost is felt in the "absolute black" backdrop, though the Dimming's mechanics remain slightly abstract despite atmospheric weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete alchemy: "copper for blue, strontium for red" becomes "REMEMBER WONDER" mosaic tiles reforged into rockets. Avoids moralizing by having the final image ("make our own constellations") reweight the premise without stating the lesson, though "gravity of hopelessness" edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinct perceptual signature—pyrotechnic rhythms ("sulfur and saltpeter") filter all observation—while modulating under pressure. The chant's evolution into chorus shows rhythmic control, with no POV leakage despite communal scenes. "Ambient awareness" phrasing slightly strains lexicon but serves focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; sentences like "filtering despair into determination, one footstep, one spark" achieve high density without muddle. Minor register drift in "conceptual cost" near closure costs 0.1, but propulsion remains relentless with varied syntax supporting the escalating hope motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms apocalyptic tropes through specific alchemy: hope measured in kerosene knots and phosphorescent moss. Emotional truth anchors the fresh synthesis—children's "forced laughter" to dancing—as the fortress becomes both setting and metaphor without abstraction. Risk-taking heightens stakes via communal creation.</comment>
