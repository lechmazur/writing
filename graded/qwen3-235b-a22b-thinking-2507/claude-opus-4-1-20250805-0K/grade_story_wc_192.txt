<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "cauterized at exactly the right moment" versus "drowned in others' needs," but backstory blocks risk summary over micro-choice; scars glow as embodied cost elevates closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost ("scars began to glow faintly") under Accumulative/Textural lens; density shift when shadow presses closer reweights suffocation stakes decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Charcoal pillars and doorknocker ring function as micro-setting that charges final image ("ring grew warm"), constraining her method of teaching through tangible objects rather than abstract symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when shadow "pressed closer" forcing keeper's agency; cost legible in "weight of unspent words," but timeframe lacks live-clock pressure on decisions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "fading thresholds" reconfigured by final image of bridges burning to light the way—no moralizing, with suffocation/breathing motif earning resonance via concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "shadows pooled like wounded animals" shows selective POV bias, but minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" phrasing slightly fractures voice under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density falters in "gasping in the space between existence and void" where abstraction dulls immediacy; otherwise zero loops with rhythmic propulsion through starlight/suffocation imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms hermit trope through "linking through scars" method; specificity of "diagonal scar" and bridge-burning logic feels inevitable yet fresh, avoiding safety-middle abstraction.</comment>
