<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas’s insomnia and embalmer’s craft drive contradictory impulses (preparing others for rest while denied it himself), culminating in earned renunciation when he transforms the lens. Librarians lack sufficient agency to deepen relationship dynamics, slightly undercutting crucible potential.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: Silas’s lifelong "chased stillness" stops as librarians close eyes, with visible cost in "silence bloomed like funeral flowers." Accumulative lens holds through grief-density buildup without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The broken lens constrains every choice—from package arrival to revitalization—and charges the final image by casting "peaceful darkness of earned sleep." Coral mausoleums directly enable the thematic resolution, avoiding ornamental symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation via Silas’s agency: his embalming skills refract into preparing knowledge for burial, narrowing options to a single path (transform library). Cost is unmistakable when librarians "closed their eyes for the first time in millennia," altering the story’s emotional trajectory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (washing pages with saltwater rituals), not abstraction. Final image—"silence bloomed like funeral flowers"—resonantly answers how rest is earned without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through embodied specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: undertaker’s eye notices "rainbow ghosts" and "breathable grief." Rhythm modulates from terse descent ("The descent took three days") to lyrical transformation, with no head-hopping despite underwater library’s scale.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "coral-encrusted columns supported vaults of preserved air" does triple duty (setting, constraint, theme). Slight register drift in "chased stillness" is redeemed by context, avoiding closure dulling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via specific synthesis: lighthouse lens as consciousness-refractor, library as "morgue for civilizations." Emotional truth in insomniac undertaker finding rest through service avoids generic novelty, with risk-taking heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
