<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena’s embodied grief ("hands that had once trembled") and contradictory impulses—crafting transformation symbols yet hesitating on her own—are concrete and earned. Visitor’s fresh grief lacks depth, slightly weakening relationship dynamics under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "subdued ardor... genuinely artificial and absolutely true" reweights transformation. Minor flaw: cost feels intellectualized rather than viscerally felt in the final action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Observatory functions as micro-setting; the dome’s aperture framing stars directly charges the closure image. Candlelight constrains Elena’s work and becomes the beacon for lost souls, shaping her choices throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single dominant stake ("learning to burn without dying") tightens through Elena’s micro-choices (stencil hesitation, crane-folding). Cost is unmistakable: her "subdued ardor" embodies irreversible change with earned emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the phoenix stencil and cranes; final line’s "genuinely artificial and absolutely true" reframes grief without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by rooting insight in concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("silver wire coiling beneath steady hands") and rhythmic control shine. One filter verb ("she recognized the posture") in high-pressure beat slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("candlelight joining the constellation of flames"). "Subdued ardor" near closure edges toward abstraction but avoids thematic echo by anchoring in physical action (folding crane).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes through specific details (origami coordinates, memorial jewelry). Risk-taking heightens stakes: observatory as "timeless space" crystallizes emotional transformation without gimmickry.</comment>
