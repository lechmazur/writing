<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("gifts from enhancement... now perfect victim") embodied through trauma responses; final teaching choice earned by recalibrating proprioception from survival to safety. Slight deduction for "mathematics of mercy" realization bordering on over-articulation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options: Lyra walking into forest with "precision felt like freedom" reconfigures suffering through UV patterns. Orientation perfect by line 3. Cost proof slightly abstract (emotional release vs. physical price) but undeniable in "weight finally equaled."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>UV forest constrains every choice (paths visible only in her spectrum) and charges final image (teaching child forest patterns). Pewter strap functions as micro-setting: its weight calculation enables trauma inversion. Meets 9+ gate via environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transforming trauma into healing) signaled by "mathematics of mercy" realization. Escalation via deepening: trauma responses become data for inverse equations. Cost legible in abandoned strap but lacks visceral physicality; conceptual cost sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: teaching child to "see patterns" reweights "decimals of pain" without moralizing. Final image ("build mathematics of healing") offers resonant answer to central question. Avoids Thematic Echo despite mathematical framing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bioluminescent canopy pulsing in wavelengths only she could see") with rhythmic control under pressure. Sentence compression ("her lungs remembering how to breathe without permission") teaches pattern early. No head-hopping; voice modulates from clinical to lyrical.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion but minor paraphrase loop: "gifts from enhancement procedures... Now those same enhancements made her perfect victim" repeats core idea without added pressure. Prevents 9.0; no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms interrogation trope through proprioceptive math lens. Specificity (47g strap, 23° hunch) avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes: UV forest's Fibonacci spirals make healing tangible. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
