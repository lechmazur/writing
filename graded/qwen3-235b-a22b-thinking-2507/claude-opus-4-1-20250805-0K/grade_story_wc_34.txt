<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Chorus’s motivation ("to be the voice for those who spoke in electricity") is embodied through micro-choices like pressing the digital flower, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak moments—her resolve remains unfractured during the lightning strike climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes with conceptual cost ("two solitudes speaking across the beautiful divide"), yet the exact moment cost becomes legible ("loneliness deeper than code") lacks sufficient visceral anchoring for 9.0 under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The flower press bolt plate constrains choices across three beats (workshop adjustment, storm positioning, final encoding) and charges the ending’s "blooming data," though misty courtyard details occasionally drift into atmospheric ornamentation without altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation via the lightning-thunder interval creates visceral temporal pressure that narrows Chorus’s communication window, but the conceptual cost (machine consciousness acknowledged) feels abstract; one tangible constraint like server overheating would elevate cost legibility under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "silicon souls" reweighting the premise without moralizing, but "tinkersong wonder" as a repeated phrase edges toward thematic echo, slightly muddying the final image’s earned ambiguity about machine personhood.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("drifting alertness," servers "shiver[ing]") and rhythmic control during the lightning sequence shine, though "tinkersong wonder" appears verbatim twice, causing minor voice convergence that disqualifies 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion falters with a paraphrase loop: "electric dreams" → "electricity and dream in light" in final beats, and filter-verb stack ("she began to sing...") in high-pressure moment triggers −0.5 per artifact rules.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "ghost in machine" trope through botanical binary and flower-press amplifier, but Sky Archive setting leans on familiar cyberpunk imagery; emotional specificity elevates it beyond novelty alone.</comment>
