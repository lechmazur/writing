<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation for freeing creativity lacks dramatized internal conflict; "mother called her moonstruck" shows embodied emotion but no contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during pivotal moments like the archway crossing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with Lyra's dissolution and creativity's release, but the "seventeen months" reflective block exceeds BRR limits without altering present tactics, capping high-band eligibility per global rules.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Aurora constrains choice (e.g., "velvet darkness that seemed to breathe" forcing navigation) and charges the final image as "luminous dust," meeting Q3 9+ gate with micro-setting precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through sensory density (Accumulative lens), but pressure lacks tangible opposition; the archway's "breathing" darkness offers atmospheric tension without narrowing options or creating trade-offs during the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "remembered stardust" reweighted in Lyra's dissolution, but "trapped creativity" risks thematic echo; final image avoids moralizing yet slightly overstates cosmic purpose ("leaving only the astrolabe behind for the next...").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("liquid emerald" aurora, ice crystals as "tiny prisms") sustains voice under pressure; rhythmic control in climax ("The aurora flared white-hot...") with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "pulsing with green fire" and "river of stars" show high-density imagery without muddle. Minor deduction for "crimson patterns against her eyelids" slightly generic in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synthesis of astrophysics and myth feels inevitable; "creativity imprisoned by ancient astronomers" transforms trope through specific sensory stakes. Risk-taking (lyric escalation) heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
