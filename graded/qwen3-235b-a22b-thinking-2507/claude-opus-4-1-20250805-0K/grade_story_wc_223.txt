<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("benevolently ruthless") and micro-choices (spelling W-I-T-N-E-S-S) reveal values under pressure. Final renunciation ("busy unbinding small truths") is earned through prior causality with visible cost in her isolation. Only minor flaw: limited embodied stress response during visitor interruption.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance with conceptual cost: "pawns were gone, but their spaces remembered them" reconfigures meaning through absence. Accumulative lens holds—density increase in final walk ("W-E R-E-M-A-I-N") reweights the dominant stake without causal breaks. Cost is unmistakable in the luminous absence motif.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Whispering gallery functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (walking-spelling method) and charges closure: echoes holding names become the parliament of whispers. Chessboard’s missing pawns directly shape her final action—spelling pawn names—making environment indispensable to the ending’s charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when the visitor interrupts ("They want witnesses"), forcing Marina’s renunciation that forecloses official recognition. Under Accumulative lens, the deepening (her refusal reframing "witness") narrows options with visible cost: her solitude as new government forms. Agency drives escalation through her documentation choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pawns’ absence and small gestures—no moralizing. Final image ("W-E R-E-M-A-I-N") reweights prior material as resonant answer: meaning persists in absence. Avoids false equivalence by rejecting the "crisis actor" narrative while embracing unremembered lives’ dignity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("documenting something truer than tragedy") and rhythmic control in walking sequences. Voice modulates under pressure ("benevolently ruthless" shows character-specific diction). Minor flaw: visitor’s dialogue slightly expository but redeemed by Marina’s whisper-response.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("luminous absence" avoids cliché). Final line "Marina walked on" has perfect cadence. One near-miss: "microseconds of meaning" slightly abstract but redeemed by concrete examples (collar adjustment, wedding ring tracing). Propulsion never flags.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms "crisis actor" trope through historical specificity (interregnum, pawns as dead). Risk-taking in structure (no dialogue climax) heightens stakes—her quiet endurance feels inevitable. "Luminous absence" reconfiguration avoids symbolic convenience by charging closure with conceptual cost.</comment>
