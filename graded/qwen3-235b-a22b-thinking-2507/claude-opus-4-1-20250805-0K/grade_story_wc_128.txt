<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through concrete action: Margot's "fingers trembled" discovering the locket yet she initiates the journey, embodying the "cycles" theme via professional shrewdness turned compassionate agency without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "accounts balanced themselves through currencies beyond calculations" reweights her ledger-keeping identity, crystallized when tucking the student's photo beside manifests—a felt conceptual price paid on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The roofless library functions as micro-setting that charges closure: Martha teaching navigation there enables Margot's book-brokering, culminating in her sorting donations "beneath Orion's belt"—environment constrains choices and elevates the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Margot's agency: choosing personal delivery over transactional forwarding narrows options, with cost visible in her identity shift from broker to compassion-brokerer, though the timeframe lacks live-clock pressure tightening decisions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—Samuel's lantern-light lessons, Margot brokering book "cargo"—avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights "cycles of compassion" as "tidal certainty" lifting contributors into starlight without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: maritime diction ("brokered," "holds") and compressed lyricism ("breeze carry pages' whispers like symphony notes") modulate under pressure; single POV maintains coherent focalization without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion ("She initiated her plan the next morning" compresses agency). Minor register drift in "fierce hope—whispered of cycles" slightly over-ornaments a pivotal beat without dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "found object" trope through specific maritime logic: the locket's ship's-wheel photo ties to Martha's seafaring life, making compassion a navigational chart where "knowledge weighed nothing in their holds"—fresh synthesis with emotional specificity.</comment>
