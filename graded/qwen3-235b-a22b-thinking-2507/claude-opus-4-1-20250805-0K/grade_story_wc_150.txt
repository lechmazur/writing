<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Miriam's embodied conflict—trembling fingers, dreams as physical manifestations—grounds her shift from survival to faith. Her micro-choice to fit the gnomon earns the closure, though the pivot from "faith meant nothing" to kneeling feels slightly accelerated without sufficient hesitation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: the shadow moving across names (not numbers) reconfigures time with undeniable conceptual cost ("Time returns all wanderers"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly, with density culminating in the inscription’s revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard isn’t backdrop but active constraint: roots lift tombs, forcing "purposeful wandering" navigation. Olives ripening through tombs charges the final image, making environment indispensable to the closure’s meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Miriam’s agency—fitting the gnomon forecloses her diaspora evasion. The cost (twenty years of avoidance) is felt in her hands holding the bronze, though escalation lacks a sharper mid-beat complication to elevate further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: sundial names reweighting time, roots embracing bones. The final image ("bones conversing with earth") answers the central question without moralizing, though near-echoes of cyclical return tropes prevent 9.0+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: Miriam notices soil on bronze, not angels. Yakov’s dialogue ("You came back") carries subtext of inevitability. Rhythmic control under pressure—short clauses for tension, lyrical flow for revelation—avoids head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; "cautious enchantment settling into her chest" risks abstraction but is redeemed by immediate action ("kneeling, clearing soil"). Slight register drift in "conceptual cost" phrasing in peak beat prevents 9.0, though propulsion remains taut.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: catacomb orchard transforms diaspora tropes through visceral specifics (olives in ribcages, bees in ossuaries). Emotional truth avoids sentimentality, but the "interrupted journeys" motif leans on familiar dream logic without sufficient transformation.</comment>
