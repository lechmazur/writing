<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong (tried blood offerings vs. communal memory path), but the thematic shift to "communities gathered at first light" lacks groundwork in prior failures; epiphany feels slightly unearned despite embodied emotion ("iron bands snapped"). Micro-choices under pressure (whisper to louder song) reveal value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "dawn came not from cosmic obligation but from communal choice" reconfigures reality with undeniable cost ("tomorrow they would need to sing again"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; density increases via memory-layering until the mica window's luminescence. Orientation anchored by para 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse constrains every choice: singing trees' roots enable the climax, iron framework rings as pressure builds, mica window's resonance directly charges the final image. Sensory details (husks rattling like maracas, ghost-music in bark) are selective and POV-filtered, evolving causally with the song.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: Elara's micro-choices (whisper → louder song → weaving memories) deepen pressure until the mica window glows. Dominant stake (rekindling dawn) tightens via visible cost—perpetual singing labor—and narrows options away from failed rituals. No coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through particulars: "bread rising, morning markets, dew on spider silk" crystallize "woven dawns" without abstraction. Final image ("swaddle their fragile world in the only light that truly mattered") reweights the premise with conceptual cost, avoiding moralizing. No thematic echo or false binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices musical ghosts in bark and "light-fruit," with botanical lexicon shaping observation. Rhythmic control under pressure ("melody felt fragile... swaddle emptiness") modulates with emotional intensity. One borderline detached simile ("scattered pearls") prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; high density ("husks rattled like maracas filled with dead seeds" does triple duty). Sentences vary rhythm for propulsion ("She began with a whisper..."). Minor overwriting risk in "scattered pearls" simile, but payoff in final "swaddle" reprise justifies it. Closure image ("light they made themselves") crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms apocalypse tropes via specific, grounded synthesis: "woven dawn" as communal labor (not hero's triumph) feels inevitable. Fresh details ("dew on spider silk," "off-key and earnest" singing) avoid genericness. Risk-taking (lyric escalation) heightens stakes without obscuring closure's cost.</comment>
