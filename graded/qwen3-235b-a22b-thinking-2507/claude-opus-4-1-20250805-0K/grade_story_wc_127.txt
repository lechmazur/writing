<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Vera’s temptation to absorb emotions versus her cardinal rule; embodied tension in "static electricity still tingled on her fingertips" avoids label-speak. Slight abstraction in "merciful lies that are truer than honesty" risks thematic echo but stays grounded in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Vera emerges carrying harvested half-truths with static-touched fingers, crystallizing her stance with visible cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds as emotional density narrows her options toward the grotto’s sealing, reweighting the "small mercy" premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Amber grotto’s transformation actively constrains tactics—dusk deadline forces urgency, static electricity enables harvesting. The blotter petal evolves from tool to emotional vessel, charging the final image where Vera presses it "against her heartbeat" to fuse insight with empathy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Vera’s race against the grotto’s sealing, but internal conflict (absorbing emotions vs. professional boundary) lacks tangible escalation beyond psychological tension. Cost is felt in her isolation, though physical manifestation via static tingles elevates closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through visceral particulars: "joy untethered from its inevitable loss" reframes emotional fragmentation as mercy without moralizing. Final image of "incomplete truths" reweights the premise through concrete action, avoiding abstraction while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vera’s perceptual signature—filtering amber’s "pools of liquid gold" through emotional harvesting—creates distinct rhythm. Sentences modulate under pressure ("sparks danced," "hair stood on end"), with non-standard static mechanics taught early and paid off in the tingling closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion via concrete verbs ("crackling," "danced," "pulled"). "Burgundy spread across the petal" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor density dip in emotion listing ("A father’s pride divorced...") avoided overwriting through purposeful accumulation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "counterfeit emotion dealer" with amber-preserved half-truths feels inevitable. Avoids tropes via tactile mechanics (static harvesting) and morally ambiguous premise, though risk-taking stays within lyrical realism rather than structural boldness.</comment>
