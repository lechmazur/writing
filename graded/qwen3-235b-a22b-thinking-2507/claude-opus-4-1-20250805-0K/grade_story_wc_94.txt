<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied action ("furiously tranquil" breathing vs racing mind during lightning strike), with micro-choices revealing her hierarchy of values—sealing the envelope shows commitment to resistance over self-preservation, charged by the censors' red-ink scars on her manuscripts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: Maya sealing the envelope at dawn crystallizes perpetual risk ("someone would find it"), while the "electric kiss" lingering in air reconfigures stakes—revolution as inevitable vapor, not violent rupture, under the accumulative/textural lens established by paragraph 3's "pause between exposure and revelation."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The darkroom timer constrains every choice (3-minute exposures dictating her poetic process), while the observatory's "above cloud line" perspective directly charges the final image—"mist that passed through chains" emerges from the setting's physical reality, transforming atmospheric observation into resistance metaphor without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation through deepening understanding: lightning strike during the timer's countdown forces her to refine "rarefying" language into actionable resistance ("planting seeds in negative space"), narrowing options to perpetual vigilance—the visible cost is sealing the envelope, knowing dawn brings interrogators who'll "find only weather logs" while missing the revolution in "grammar of storms."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—"cartography of scars" becomes an "atlas of absences"—with the final image ("mist that passed through chains") reweighting censorship as permeable, avoiding moralizing; the censors' fear of "masks slipping" crystallizes the central question without stating it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters all experience through astronomical/photographic lexicon ("constellation of fear," "stars burning messages"), with rhythmic compression under stress ("Timer reached zero, its buzz barely audible") modulating voice organically—no head-hopping, and elision (bus timetable hiding place) taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "Each deletion had taught her the exact shape of what couldn't be said" does triple duty (character/theme/plot) without scaffold; minor paraphrase loop in "vigil continued, furiously tranquil" prevents 9.5+, but no figurative muddle in peak beats—lightning strike sequence breathes with urgent syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms censorship tropes through specific mechanisms: photographing poems with penlight in darkness, "negative space" as resistance terrain. The bus timetable hiding place (Q9F) feels lived-in, not contrived, synthesizing surveillance and mundane infrastructure into organic risk—bold structural choice where photographic process *is* the resistance.</comment>
