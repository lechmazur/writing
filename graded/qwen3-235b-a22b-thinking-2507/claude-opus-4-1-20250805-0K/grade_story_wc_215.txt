<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses (solitude vs duty) act simultaneously when lifting the box; motivation rooted in embodied "mute eloquence" avoids therapy-speak. Final choice to preserve silence earns endurance with cost: "the weight of what they couldn’t say would still rest here." Slight underdevelopment in inherited flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "desert will continue its slow consumption" reconfigures stakes via Accumulative lens. Orientation clear by line 3 ("abandoned apiaries... oasis"). Lens ambiguity avoided; cost proof in "heavy and luminous as honey in abandoned combs" crystallizes conceptual price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Apiaries constrain choice from first paragraph ("careful steps... disturbing nothing"); the stained glass box charges the final image as "captured sunset" holding "words that died with the bees." Environment directly shapes tactics and closure, meeting 9+ gate via micro-setting pressure on every decision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (preserving unspoken words) signaled early via ghost gestures; escalation through Mara’s agency interpreting "contextual clues" deepens knowledge with cost. Ghost urgency forces stance crystallization. Cost unmistakable in final image’s "luminous" weight, though conceptual price slightly obscures visceral impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "tangled promises" motif, not moralizing. Final image reweights silence as "luminous" honey—a resonant answer to "what wasn’t said"—without stating morals. Complexity honored: silence as both betrayal and sacred duty, avoiding false equivalence. No thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bleached by decades of desert sun") and rhythmic control in climax ("carrying the luminous weight of their collective failure and love"). Purposeful compression taught early; no head-hopping. Minor tense shift ("had lived" to present action) slightly jars but serves reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; "amber and crimson panels catching dawn light that shouldn’t exist" achieves high density without muddle. Final paragraph’s cadence accelerates closure ("She gazed... then turned") with crystalline propulsion. No figurative overwriting; every line charges atmosphere or stakes. Near-flawless momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope through specific beekeeping logic: "tangled covenant" as living document reframes ecological collapse. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes—preserving silence as active guardianship. Fresh synthesis of "mute eloquence" feels inevitable, though premise edges near familiar post-apocalyptic templates.</comment>
