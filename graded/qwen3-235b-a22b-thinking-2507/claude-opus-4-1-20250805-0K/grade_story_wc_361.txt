<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s embodied contradiction (tremor as flaw/asset) drives the climax; her micro-choice to hold up the pendant crystallizes values with visible cost ("responsibility Corvin left her"). No diagnostic label-speak, though transformation slightly swift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "hands still shook... but now she understood the tremor differently" reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost ("carrying responsibility"). Orientation clear by line 10; Accumulative lens holds through density escalation to aurora-fade convergence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ridgeway’s magnetic pulse constrains the entire action—only here can relics "germinate." Final image of pendant catching aurora light charges closure, fulfilling 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy flawlessly mirrors urgency (calm: "weathered vertebra humming"; crisis: narrowed to pendant vibration).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (delivering significance) tightens through Accumulative density: aurora vibration → Luminari appearance → knowledge transfer. Cost ("responsibility to ensure treasures lived") legible in final image, though conceptual cost slightly less visceral than ideal for top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "brief encounters" motif reweighted by lived experience: Corvin’s quoted theory becomes Elara’s embodied truth ("every delivery resurrect wonder"). Final line avoids moralizing while answering central question with resonant specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ridgeway stretched like a spine of ancient stone") modulates perfectly under pressure—sentences shorten during Convergence ("She held the pendant up..."). Zero head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentional during knowledge flood.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "germinate into something more" slightly risks mixed metaphor but redeemed by "seeds waiting to bloom" setup. Final paragraph’s cadence shift ("Her hands still shook... but now she understood") avoids loop artifacts while deepening closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Tremor as resonance" transforms courier trope through specific sensory logic. Emotional truth in mentor’s disappearance-as-transcendence avoids derivative pitfalls; specificity (dragonfly wings in crystal resin) grounds universals without quirk.</comment>
