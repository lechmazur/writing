<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation for forbidden knowledge remains told not dramatized; no visible internal conflict between curiosity and fear during key choices like seeking the bathroom, weakening causal urgency despite strong embodied emotion ("tongue thick with temporal vertigo").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost—"terrible joy of understanding" crystallized in silver-juice imagery—but missing persistent constraint (bathroom device resolves tension too cleanly) prevents 9.0 despite perfect Accumulative/Textural lens adherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Astral orchard functions as micro-setting that charges closure: "blossoms fell upward" mirrors temporal paradox, while bathroom's bark-grown porcelain directly constrains the breakthrough moment, satisfying Q3's 9+ gate requirement for environment charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency (following coordinates, seeking bathroom) deepens knowledge stakes, but lacks visible price altering tactics; the bathroom resolution feels convenient without cost, missing the band guardrail requirement for visible price charging the final image under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action—shell carving across time—and avoids moralizing; final image ("circle with no beginning, teaching itself how to exist") reweights inheritance without stating a moral, perfectly executing Conceptual Repricing's non-literal answer requirement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "temporal vertigo" and bark-grown bathroom, with rhythmic control tightening during disorientation ("She emerged... orchard changed"); minor academic drift in "simply complicated" barely prevents 9.5+ despite flawless patterned elision teaching the time-loop logic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts: every line advances multiple elements ("phantom apple blossoms drifted past" establishes physics/mood/stakes), with final image's "juice ran silver... sweet with forbidden knowledge" achieving crystalline density; only a hairline slip in "terrible joy" slightly over-articulating emotion prevents 10.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms time-loop trope through curator-specific lens (museum context, pistachio shell), with "terrible joy" offering fresh emotional truth; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscurity, though derivative echoes of Borges' circular time slightly cap the score.</comment>
