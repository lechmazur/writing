<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Coachman's embodied motivation shines through micro-choices (e.g., pressing seeds into shrapnel-laced soil), but the plague backstory reflection slightly exceeds BRR limits without altering present tactics, softening interior contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly; Charged Poise closure lands with conceptual cost (war memory becoming "fertile soil") made undeniable by the reef's calcium embrace imagery, though reef-death backstory edges toward summary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Jetty setting constrains every choice (gulls dictate planting sites, planks dictate seed scattering), charging the final image where roots reach "reef's calcium embrace"—environment actively digests war's remnants.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (garden consuming battlefield) tightens through deepening knowledge (gulls' shifting calls revealing phosphorus), but the coachman's agency feels slightly passive within the Accumulative lens, softening escalation's teeth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: "garden would eat the battlefield whole" crystallizes nature's reclamation without moralizing; final image ("especially fertile soil") reweights war's cost as ecological renewal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice modulates masterfully under pressure (e.g., "roots reaching down toward the reef's calcium embrace" shifts rhythm to match growth), though the Sumerian prayer fragment risks slight register drift from coachman's POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; every sentence propels atmosphere ("purple twilight bled across the harbor"), but "narrow vastness" repetition in final paragraph approaches scaffold, barely avoiding −0.2 under Text-Artifact Screen.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms war/nature tropes via "submerged concord" specificity; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, making forgetting "a mercy" feel inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
