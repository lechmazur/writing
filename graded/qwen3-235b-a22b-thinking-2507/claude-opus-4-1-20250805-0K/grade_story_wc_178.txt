<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "frugality wasn't poverty but purpose," with embodied emotion in trembling fingers tracing numbers. Final covenant choice earns visible cost through years of sacrifice, though "empirically ironic" edges toward diagnostic label-speak in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the covenant sealing crystallizes options with undeniable cost in "frugal years purchased something invaluable." Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density increasing as phosphorescent maps activate, reweighting the dominant stake through felt resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The magic square tile functions as essential micro-setting, constraining choices when Mara overlays charts and charging the final image as beacon-key. Sensory specificity in "ceramic tile depressions" and "phosphorescent mortar" avoids white-room syndrome, though olfactory/tactile details beyond stone and tile are sparse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen organically: "deciphering blueprints" evolves into "method for communicating across impossible distances," narrowing options to one pivotal choice. Agency drives escalation as planetary alignment triggers the tile's release, with cost legible in "sustained attention across generations" crystallized in Mara's lifetime of frugality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "devotion to understanding became indistinguishable from the understanding itself" reweights the covenant without moralizing. Final image of "dusky harmony" offers resonant answer to "what bridges infinite?" through mathematical truth, avoiding thematic echo with zero abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "erosion patterns on palace stones" and "mathematical harmony" thought-process. Rhythmic control elevates pressure through cadence shifts ("Light erupted... gentle as sunset through amber"), though "empirically ironic" momentarily drifts toward academic register in high-stakes beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; high density in "schematic representations lit with phosphorescent minerals." Minor scaffold in "trembling fingers" cliché, but propulsion remains sharp through concrete verbs like "uncloak" and "resonate." Final image avoids figurative muddle with "amber" light metaphor serving closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "ancient alien" trope through math-devotion synthesis; "ceramic tiles instead of gold" feels freshly specific. Risk-taking in making attention the currency heightens stakes without gimmickry, with "patient intelligence teaching through numbers" offering non-obvious moral calculus on communication.</comment>
