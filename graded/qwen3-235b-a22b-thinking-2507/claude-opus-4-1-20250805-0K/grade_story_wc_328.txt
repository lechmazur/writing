<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina's undercover duality and Thorne's grief-driven tremors create embodied conflict; "frostbitten hope" crystallizes contradictory impulses without therapy-speak during pivotal revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: arrowhead dissolution + Thunderbird song reweights "harmony untamed" as active participation, not passive observation, under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Gravity pockets constrain action (floating soil, upward arrow) and charge finale; bioluminescent garden's simultaneous root growth embodies the core theme physically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single stake (grief vs. transcendence) escalates through Marina's agency: her "release your grief" directive forces Thorne's crystallization, with cost legible in trembling hands and abandoned documentation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Suffering could become transcendence" emerges from concrete actions (pocketing arrowhead, dialing static), avoiding moralizing; cosmic joke reweights prior bitterness as revolutionary in final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "map gravity anomalies" vs. "bitterness of loss" phrasing; rhythm modulates from clinical opening to lyrical "frostbitten hope bloomed into certainty" under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops: "cordless phone crackled to life, though no one had dialed" compresses rule-establishment, tension, and mechanism in one propulsive line; no figurative muddle in high-stakes static confessions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms cryptid trope via grief-as-obstacle specificity; "cosmic joke" synthesis feels inevitable through arrowhead physics and Thorne's moth-frequency daughter, avoiding safety middle.</comment>
