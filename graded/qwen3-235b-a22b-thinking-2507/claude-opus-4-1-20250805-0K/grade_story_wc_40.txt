<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's reticence and scholarly obsession manifest in embodied terms ("grief-tender," "time-drunk" neologisms) rather than labels. Her micro-choice to testify through silence—rooted in years of loving "something others declared dead"—earns the closure with visible cost in her weathered smile against institutional authority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: Elena's silent testimony crystallizes language's living state with conceptual cost (the Committee's crumbling authority). The Accumulative lens holds throughout, with pressure tightening via the crystal's refractions until the final line's "first of something else" reconfigures meaning without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The library functions as essential micro-setting: dawn light through the crystal transforms shelves into "breathing" entities, directly constraining Elena's testimony method. The crystal itself charges the closure as it "sang with reflected sound," making environment inseparable from the final linguistic reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elena's agency under the Accumulative lens: her decision to testify via fractured sequences—not Committee demands—narrows options to a single charged moment. The cost is unmistakable in the crystal warming "against her palm" as institutional authority visibly fractures.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete linguistic growth ("mushrooms after rain," "words like seeds"), avoiding moralizing. The final image—"the first of something else was just beginning to speak"—resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral, reweighting the frozen dictionary through organic particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in scholarly yet lyrical phrasing ("tracking words backward through time like following breadcrumbs home"). Rhythmic control deepens under pressure: fragmented syntax during crystal refractions contrasts with the Committee's "institutional authority," teaching and paying off elision seamlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "dust motes hung motionless" simultaneously anchors time, setting, and Elena's resolve. Final line avoids overwriting with "beginning to speak"—a precise, resonant action that recharges the crystal motif without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "dying language" tropes through the crystal's physics and Elena's neologisms ("grief-tender"). Risk-taking in poetic structure heightens stakes: the Accumulative design makes linguistic evolution visceral, with "mushrooms after rain" offering irreplaceable specificity that avoids generic abstraction.</comment>
