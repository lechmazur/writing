<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses (vengeance transformed into patience) drive her subversion of ritual; final choice to expose failures earns the fragile hope with visible cost ("admitting we’re not the heroes"). No diagnostic label-speak; embodied grief in "laughed, broken music" and tactical shift rejecting pride.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): suns touching while delegations recognize personal grief in the clipboard’s failures. Cost is legible in Mara’s "admitting we’re not the heroes" line. Accumulative lens holds—pressure builds through historical weight, not causal turns, with single deepening (her speech) sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The terrace and clipboard function as micro-setting, constraining choice (Mara uses it to subvert ritual) and charging closure (new light "like suns touching"). Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered: Theren’s "bones chimed," Kolani "moving like grief itself," avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early ("clinging to wounds like treasure"); Mara’s agency tightens options via her speech reframing redemption. Cost is visceral: abandoning "narrative of righteousness" risks political survival. Single deepening suffices, but escalation lacks one more pressure point beyond the speech to hit 9.0 band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: red lights → new light, not moralizing. Final image ("painful and necessary and true") reweights "redemption" without stating a moral. Subtext in gestures (Theren bones singing minor key) avoids false balance—both sides are "honestly damaged," yet stakes feel urgent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices "corona bleeding into corona," "transparency and darkness blurred." Rhythm modulates under pressure—short, fragmented sentences during her speech ("We’ve mustered here forty-seven times"). No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally as tension peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line does triple duty (e.g., "ebony clipboard had absorbed centuries of tears" establishes history, emotion, and object). Figurative language sparse but potent ("moving like grief itself"); final line’s cadence crystallizes theme without muddle. One borderline cliché ("broken music") prevents 10.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms peace trope through specific worldbuilding (memory-glass, crystalline Theren). Emotional truth in "admitting we’ve all become what we fought against" avoids middle-ground hedging. Fresh inflection: redemption as surrendering hero narratives, not forgiveness—synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
