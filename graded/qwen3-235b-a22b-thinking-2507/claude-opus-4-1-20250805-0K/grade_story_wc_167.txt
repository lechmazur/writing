<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in glazier's shift from technical observer to meaning-finder; embodied emotion in "fingers traced the prism atrium" avoids therapy-speak. Final renunciation (documenting vs. fighting demolition) earns cost through stone-throwing micro-choices, though reflective blocks slightly over-rely on abstraction during high-pressure dawn sequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "The prism atrium would fall, but its lesson would remain" crystallizes the stake reweighting. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—ripples' density increase forces stance crystallization. Orientation clear by line 5; cost proof evident in bulldozers imagery concretizing loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prism atrium functions as active micro-setting—its geometry distorts ripples, constraining Marcus's observations and charging the final gilded patterns. Pool and stones drive choices, but Pearl Bay setting remains postcard-like; mist matters yet lacks pressure on tactics beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation through ripple density reweights "preserve meaning vs. demolition" stake under Accumulative lens. Stone throws deepen understanding ("complicate the fading ones"), narrowing options to documentation. Cost visible in "last morning before everything shifted," though timeframe's "before shift" lacks live-clock pressure on decisions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete ripple/light physics, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("surfaces weren't barriers but birthplaces") reweights meaning without stating morals. Near-slips: "complexity lived in clarity" borders abstraction, but "ancient dance of ripples" grounds it in earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in glazier's light/fracture observations; rhythm shifts from misty fragments to lyrical dawn crescendo. Zero head-hopping, consistent psychic distance. Minor deduction: "gift for reading between lines" slightly abstract in high-pressure fracture analysis beat, redeemed by immediate concrete example.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "concentric rings spread outward, perfect circles disturbed by the atrium's geometry" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Only microscopic flaw: "orchestrated an extraordinary display" risks elevated diction, but profession justifies it. Final paragraph avoids overwriting while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "artist vs. development" trope through glazier's physics lens—value found in interference patterns, not nostalgia. Risk-taking in ripples as core mechanism feels inevitable. Freshness anchored in verifiable detail (noctilucent clouds, river stone texture), though Pearl Bay setting lacks specificity.</comment>
