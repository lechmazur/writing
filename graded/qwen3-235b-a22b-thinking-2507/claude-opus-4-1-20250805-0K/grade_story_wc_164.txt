<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "cheerfully gloomy" acceptance of perpetual mystery; embodied emotions ("joy that tasted purple") avoid labels. Slight deduction for abstract conjecture about paths bordering on thematic echo without sufficient physical anchor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly with sprout revelation reweighting "disappearing paths" as transformation; cost legible in "work would never be finished" acceptance. Accumulative lens holds, but final cost feels slightly conceptual versus embodied.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystal cave actively constrains choices (dimming forces exit, sprouts grow through floor) and charges final image. Micro-setting mastery: crystal floor's rainbows shape perception while sprouts alter the protagonist's stance through tactile discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("why paths disappear") deepens through conjecture, culminating in sprout reconfiguration. Agency in persistent collection earns cost, but escalation lacks tangible narrowing of options; transformation feels earned though not pressured by immediate stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete particulars: sprouts reframing "disappearing paths" avoids moralizing. Final image reweights the central question with conceptual cost ("changed form, from well-worn roads to scattered seeds") without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sorrow that hummed at middle C") and rhythmic control under pressure. Minor slip: "archaeology of abandoned futures" drifts toward academic diction briefly during peak reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but "emotional fossils pressed into silicon matrix" creates contradictory vehicles (organic fossils vs. inorganic silicon), dulling closure image. No loops, yet this figurative muddle in high-pressure beat prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of "sea-foam recollectionist" transforms memory trope through specific sensory logic. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over plot) heightens stakes, though "crater glass" slightly echoes existing fragment-collection tropes without full transformation.</comment>
