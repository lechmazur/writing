<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "luminous ache" vs fear and micro-choices like striking the fork, but "ephemeral" labels verge on thematic echo. Final renunciation earned through concrete camera work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis ("not to escape... but to document") with undeniable cost in final image. Causal lens holds tight: tuning fork solution foreshadowed via leaf-fall frequency. Only minor slip in observatory's sudden stabilization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lunar observatory's carbon cables actively constrain choices (humming stress), while the clock hand's "silver blur" casts actionable shadows. Micro-setting (tuning fork) charges final image. "Changelessly constant" Earth slightly ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (prevent collapse while understanding time) tightens via clock's acceleration. Agency shines in Ezra's camera use and fork strike, but tuning fork resolution feels slightly convenient despite foreshadowing. Cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete time-threads and quantum gaps, not abstraction. Final image ("suspended between two states") reweights escape vs repair without moralizing. Slight overuse of "ephemeral" risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("luminous ache," "leaf-fall song") with rhythmic control during crisis. Sentence fragments ("Another tremor.") mirror tension. "Ephemeral" repetition slightly dilutes voice in mid-section.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; "silver blur" shows not tells. Final line "singing its leaf-fall song" achieves crystalline resonance. Only minor slip: "luminous ache" borders abstraction but redeemed by context in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel tropes via camera mechanics and leaf-fall physics. Lunar observatory isn't backdrop but essential to temporal mechanics. Risk-taking (time-threads as gossamer) heightens stakes coherently without gimmickry.</comment>
