<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown through armor dissolution vs. blood-seed transformation; micro-choice of taking puppet's hand earns closure with visible cost. Lacks layered irrationality in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (dissolving armor, blood-seed trees) under Accumulative/Textural lens. Density escalation via "ten thousand potential worlds" reweights reality-weaving stakes flawlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Obsidian floor's liquid starlight pools constrain choice (roots drinking potential) and charge final image ("cracks of light"). Silver-barked trees' self-solving equations shape every tactical move with purposeful specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by oath-speaking agency narrows options to "inhabit trembling moment before choice." Cost legible in armor dissolution and blood-seed transformation under Accumulative lens; single tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of "glow of unmanifest tomorrows" reweights reality-weaving without moralizing. Theme emerges from concrete particulars: fruit of crystallized potential → blood becoming seed trees.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature evident in "branches bent spelled out theorems." Rhythmic control peaks with "shivering bliss" compression; zero head-hopping despite reality-layering. Elision of seven years taught via marionette program.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "phosphorescent glow of ripening possibilities" does triple duty. Mild overwriting in "shivering bliss" (felt cost implied but not embodied) prevents 9.0 despite otherwise crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy + puppetry transforms tropes: marionettes' "molten possibility" cores reconfigure reality-weaving. Risk-taking heightens stakes via "cracks of light" payoff without gimmickry.</comment>
