<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (ephemeral flash-paper vs. permanent map) drives action; embodied patience ("joints stiff") shows cost. Final choice earned by 34 heartbeat counts, but minor underdevelopment in alchemy/permanence tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure lands perfectly: stiff joints + carrying impossible maps = visible cost. Accumulative lens holds through pattern completion; crater pulse shifts reweight stakes relentlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Withered orchard constrains every choice (inverted growth informs pattern), charges final image ("held up to subarctic stars"). Micro-setting (apple cores shimmering) alters tactics via pulse shifts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stake (capturing heartbeat) tightens via "world holding its breath" pressure. Cost legible in physical exhaustion, but escalation lacks one sharper narrowing of options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: "map of how the world breathes" reweights premise without moralizing. Final image ("directions to everywhere that shouldn't exist") charges cost through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("light remembered the furnace") with rhythmic control. Peak-pressure compression ("moved with slowness of growing crystals") taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; "light didn’t pour—it remembered" avoids purple prose via patterned payoff. Slight register drift in "conceptual repricing" phrasing, but closure image remains crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: flash-paper alchemy applied to cartography of impossible places. Risk-taking (inverted orchard physics) heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional truth in discarded-core patterns.</comment>
