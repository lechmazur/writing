<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in concrete action ("fingers finding notes that shouldn't exist") avoids therapy-speak, but Lira's internal conflict between knowing/action remains slightly abstract despite embodied choices. Micro-choices like mapping rhythms deepen motivation without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("enforcement squadrons would arrive soon") under Accumulative/Textural lens; density intensifies through musical pressure until the irreversible orchard transformation. Final image crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sky-bridge's humming lattice and locust shell actively constrain choices (patrol patterns, melody calibration), charging the final image where metal resonates with rebellion. Orchards' welded branches evolving into walking root-legs exemplify environment shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by Lira's agency—each calibrated note tightens options as statues falter—culminating in shattering hearts with visible cost (imminent Council arrival). Dominant stake (beauty vs. mechanization) narrows to irreversible transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><comment>Theme emerges through locust-shell metamorphosis metaphor reweighted in climax ("beauty that couldn't be optimized"), avoiding moralizing. Final image of dancing statues offers resonant answer to central question without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters world through musical metaphor ("metronomic time," "imperfection's grace"), with rhythmic compression under stress. Minor register drift in "transcended mechanical language" slightly disrupts voice cohesion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density ("stone lips parting in a gasp that hadn't been possible for three years" does triple duty), but "damaged, diminished, but real" risks label-speak. Figurative language stays precise even during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesis of locust metamorphosis and mechanical oppression feels inevitable, avoiding trope clichés through specific details like harvest-optimization devices. Risk-taking (music as liberation) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
