<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as a "quiet one" tending liminal spaces is embodied through micro-choices (feather preservation, kite repair) that reveal contradictory impulses—her solitude versus reaching out to the boy. Final endurance of broken beauty earns closure with visible cost in the snapped string. No therapy-speak; emotions layer through tactile details like the feather's shaft "broken halfway" mirroring her acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully when Mira shows the boy how "tears create new patterns," crystallizing the cost of the snapped string with conceptual weight. Orientation anchors within 100 words (who/where/when), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density builds toward the feather’s reprise charging the final image. No causality breaks; pressure tightens via the kite’s fall.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The drake’s feather (micro-setting) constrains choices: Mira presses it into her notebook, wears it, and its broken shaft shapes the final image where light "passes through differently." Sensory details like "rainwater trickling from mangrove roots" filter through Mira’s poetic bias, avoiding cliché. Environment actively pressures action—tidepool holds the feather, shallows receive the kite.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (beauty in brokenness) tighten decisively when the kite string snaps, forcing Mira’s agency—she walks toward the boy, transforming loss into mending. Cost is visceral (the "breaking heartstring" snap) and conceptual (the boy’s frozen hands), charging the final image. Escalation stays coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—Mira weaving paper through kite gaps—not moralizing. The final line ("tender mending of darkness, one thread of light") reweights prior material as a resonant, non-literal answer to "how beauty exists because of imperfection," avoiding stated morals. Epiphany is earned via the feather’s transformation and kite repair, with lingering ambiguity about loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mira’s perceptual signature shines: "symphonies in seaweed tangles" and feather barbules as "threads" reflect her poetic lens. Voice modulates under pressure—sentences shorten during the kite’s fall ("Then it happened—the sharp snap")—yet maintains lyrical rhythm. No head-hopping; focalization stays anchored in her embodied observations, like the feather’s "emerald shifting to bronze."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels meaning ("rainwater still trickling... in diminishing whispers" establishes mood and tension). Figurative language stays purposeful: "waves whispering their endless revisions" charges closure without muddle. Sentence rhythm varies naturally—longer cadences for reflection, staccato for the snap—enhancing propulsion. No register drift in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality stems from specific synthesis: Mira’s "quiet" poet role transforms kite repair into philosophical mending, avoiding trope. The feather’s broken shaft—not whole—drives the fresh insight that "beauty exists because of imperfection." Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over causality) heightens stakes coherently, with closure rooted in prior particulars like the feather’s "midnight blue" shift.</comment>
