<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: scholarship vs. folklore drives her epiphany. Embodied stress (crystallization) avoids labels, with micro-choices like breath-holding deepening stakes. Final renunciation of shame earned through grandmother memory, though secondary character pressure remains underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: crystals shedding reweights her condition with visible cost ("shed her shame"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density, with "oxygen-starved vision" crystallizing the pressure shift. No orientation debt; lens clarity evident by midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Crystallized skin functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (stress impedes writing) and charges the final image (shedding as liberation). "Saturated hush" and storm context mirror internal state without cliché. Body-as-setting requirement for 9+ band fully satisfied through causal pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (creating rune amid stress) tightens through oxygen deprivation, narrowing options to counting crystals. Agency in reframing superstition drives deepening, with cost unmistakable in "crystals began to shed." Escalation under Accumulative lens perfectly calibrated to word count.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "transforming scars into stories" crystallized when she traces her skin's geography. Final image reweights "crystalline affliction" as language without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—Master Yuen's praise echoes but doesn't state the thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: stress narrows focus to crystal fractals while "velvet hush" anchors atmosphere. Rhythmic control under pressure ("She couldn't. She held her breath...") modulates intensity. No dialogue contamination; internal voice remains distinct and embodied.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding—every line propels narrative. "Fractal branches" and "liquid starlight" avoid figurative muddle. Sentence variation mirrors tension (terse panic vs. flowing insight). Final line ("had bloomed") recharges motif with zero redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "flaw as strength" trope through crystallization-as-language specificity. "Boi" reinterpretation feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking with internal climax (no external antagonist) heightens stakes without gimmickry, grounded in bodily truth.</comment>
