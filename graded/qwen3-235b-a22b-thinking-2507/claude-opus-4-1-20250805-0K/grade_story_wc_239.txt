<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("she understood") with insufficient embodied contradiction; final choice earned but emotional progression too tidy without visible struggle between contradictory impulses during climax. Diagnostic phrasing risks label-only feeling penalties.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "Continue" reconfigures all prior endings with conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds impeccably—density increase in dictionary's evolving words tightens cosmic stakes without causal breaks. Cost proof clear in "each forgetting another form of remembering."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Library setting charges final image (transparency revealing "cosmic courtroom") but functions primarily as conceptual backdrop rather than constraining choice. Micro-setting opportunity missed: dictionary's physicality could have altered tactics earlier (e.g., page resistance during stress).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through conceptual deepening ("maya" revelation → overlapping apocalypses) under Accumulative lens. Kaia's "unify" action drives irreversible reconfiguration, but pressure lacks visible trade-offs—no competing desires tested against the 3000-heartbeat clock during climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "resounding hush" crystallizes the non-dualistic resolution without moralizing. Final "Continue" offers resonant answer to cosmic doubt, though near-miss with thematic echo in "opposition itself was the illusion" (avoids penalty by being dramatized through action).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("words leaked like smoke"), but stress-induced diction degradation absent—elevated lexicon remains uniform during universe's hiccups. Rhythmic control impeccable; patterned elision (frozen dust motes) taught early and paid off in "pause between breaths" closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold, but high metaphor density risks dilution in climax ("sound that contained all sounds and no sound"). Propulsion never stalls, though "resounding hush" repetition edges toward thematic echo. Final line "She did" achieves crystalline closure with no artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synthesis of helix mathematics, Maya philosophy, and cosmic arbitration feels inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over causal plot) heightens stakes coherently—the "universe hiccup" motif transforms from symptom to revelation without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids abstraction.</comment>
