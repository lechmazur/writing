<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses ("stellar doubt" vs. "quiet enthusiasm") drive micro-choices like palm-pressing on amber, earning closure through infinite repetition's cost. Slightly thin internal conflict beyond stated doubt limits 9+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "prepared for her first cast" crystallizes eternal repetition's conceptual cost under Accumulative lens. Minor temporal grammar slips ("would see/the static bursts") prevent 9.5+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Amber walls function as micro-setting that constrains choice (distilling information through nervous system) and charges closure ("coins sang through amber walls"). Near-perfect sensory integration elevates to 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via protagonist agency: coin casts create "micro-expansions" against contraction, with cost (eternal repetition) legible in "infinite times, each one necessary." Slight underdevelopment of internal conflict caps below 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through reversed Sisyphus metaphor and "planting possibilities," avoiding moralizing. Final image ("memory of why it had ever bothered to expand") reweights expansion as earned cost without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("temporal grammar making thoughts slippery") modulates under pressure with purposeful compression. "Stellar doubt" borders on label but avoids diagnostic speak through embodied "gnawing" metaphor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold; "saw/would see/had seen" creates intentional temporal texture. Minor paraphrase loop ("violent purple-white—and Voss pressed...") prevents 9.0 despite strong propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic contraction and backward prophecy through quantum-encoded coins. Risk-taking (reversed Sisyphus) heightens stakes without gimmickry, fulfilling 9+ requirement for organic transformation.</comment>
