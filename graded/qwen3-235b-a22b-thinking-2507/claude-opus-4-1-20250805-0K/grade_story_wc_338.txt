<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "shielded openness" concept, but epiphany about henge's purpose lacks sufficient struggle—knowledge leap from UV coordinates to "gathering place for communication through presence" feels under-earned in pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: pressing palm to map adds oils to "invisible record" with undeniable cost (career as framer abandoned for spiritual quest), under Accumulative/Textural lens where patterned oil marks accumulate meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rain-scoured vault actively constrains choices—water stains as "continents" guide her analysis, damaged roof creates light patterns for video sync, and flaking frescoes mirror her dissolving certainty, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (interpreting silence) tightens through her video comparison, but cost remains conceptual rather than visceral; Brother Thomas' 1961 gesture repetition lacks tangible consequence beyond her realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "maps tear and understanding begins" reweights the premise without moralizing, using the torn map’s physicality to reject speech-dependent empathy while embracing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct cartographer’s perceptual signature ("hesitations in their lines") modulates under pressure, though "shielded openness" label slightly abstracts the pivotal softening moment where guarded expression shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor redundancy in "methodically curious nature demanding precision" creates slight scaffold, but lyrical density ("water transformed pigment into prophecy") fuels momentum without muddling closure’s tactile climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes cartography and silent communion into fresh premise where empathy is built through accumulated touch; henge’s resistance to mapping transforms cliché into specific emotional calculus about "fragile" truths.</comment>
