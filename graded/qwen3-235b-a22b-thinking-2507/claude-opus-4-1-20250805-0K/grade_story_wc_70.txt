<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira’s involuntary honesty creates visceral contradiction (thief vs truth-teller) with embodied cost ("words tasted wrong"). Final choice to broadcast earns closure through prior causality, avoiding tidy resolution. Micro-choices like opening the box reveal value hierarchies under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: bees’ indifferent dance crystallizes hope’s fragility with undeniable cost ("truths meant to sting before they could heal"). Causal chain (blackout→drone failure→confession) tightens meaningfully. Orientation perfect within 50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lacquer box constrains choices across beats and charges the final image ("painted bees seeming to move"). Sensory details purposefully filter urgency: "copper coils still warm" grounds crisis, while "nectar-sweet air" contrasts emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mira’s agency: honesty curse forces broadcast, narrowing options to confession. Cost is unmistakable in citizens’ quiet arrival replacing expected mob—a visible tradeoff for truth. Single tightening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: bees reconfigure "kingdoms in darkness" as salvation. Final image ("carrying golden burden toward tomorrow") offers resonant answer without moralizing, avoiding sentimentality through the bees’ indifference.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "drone-dulled eyes remembering what they’d lost" filters world through Mira’s urgency. Rhythmic control under pressure ("Yes." "They’re so small.") avoids syntactic monotony while compressing stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; every line advances story. "Confession felt like honey on her tongue—thick, sweet, necessary" achieves triple duty: emotion, metaphor, and thematic weight. Final line recharges opening motif with crystalline precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: drone apocalypse refracted through toll keeper’s secret bees avoids eco-dystopia clichés. Emotional specificity ("most powerful things usually are") grounds universality in lived detail, transforming tropes through Mira’s grandmother legacy.</comment>
