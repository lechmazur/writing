<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses ("purposefully curious" vs. institutional abandonment) drive her final choice to leave the hourglass, with visible cost in "outlasted her purpose." Slight diagnostic label in "purposefully curious" weakens embodiment but micro-choices (isolating sand grain, chemical prep) reveal authentic hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the hourglass left behind crystallizes humanity's retreat with undeniable conceptual cost ("when humanity remembered its courage"). Orientation is immediate ("Luna Station Seven"), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through rhythmic chemical countdown and vapor capture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lunar regolith constrains choice as photosensitive compound ingredient, charging the final image. "Boots left prints that would last millennia" exemplifies environment shaping tactics. Misses 9+ gate as Tycho's crater doesn't pressure specific decisions beyond being the ice site.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Vera's agency: the chemical timer (her innovation) creates a live clock forcing descent before evacuation. Cost is unmistakable in "her vigil complete" as she abandons the ice pocket forever. Dominant stake (documenting the last emergence) drives every beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image of the hourglass reweights "purposefully curious" into conceptual cost without moralizing. "Morning after our species' boldest dream" earns thematic resonance through concrete particulars (sublimating ice vs. budget cuts), avoiding sentimentality while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "Earth hung pregnant and blue" filters cosmos through Vera's scientific-poetic lens. Rhythm modulates from contemplative ("tracing Tycho's rim") to urgent ("vapor emerged like a ghost's breath"). Minor register drift in "pregnant" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; "prints that would last millennia" achieves triple duty (character/theme/sensory). "Pregnant and blue" risks cliché, and "dawning hush" repetition slightly dulls closure beat. High density maintained but not flawless in peak imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "lone astronaut" trope via chemical messaging system and hourglass conceit. The 1979 space age retreat angle feels fresh through specific stakes (accountants vs. sublimating ice). Derivative safety avoided but not quite "inevitable in hindsight" for 9.0.</comment>
