<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maya's embodied interiority shines (e.g., "breathed slowly, feeling the depot's rhythm"), but Chen remains a passive observer without pressure on her choices, limiting relationship dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "I just helped them find their way" crystallizes Maya's stance with tangible cost in "fingers still tingling," under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mist depot functions as active constraint—water refraction guides repairs and charges the final image—but "corrugated metal eaves" lacks specificity to elevate beyond vivid description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Deadline pressure tightens stakes meaningfully, but the single escalation (anchor lift countdown) lacks compounding consequences beyond time pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "broken things learning to work," avoiding moralizing, though "deeper connection to craft" edges toward tell in a pivotal beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya's perceptual signature ("vibration moved through water droplets") is distinct, but Chen's dialogue lacks idiom differentiation, flattening voice under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Island of magnetic calm in the chaos" suffers stock phrasing; minor scaffold in "condensation dripped rhythmically" dulls immediacy without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Blindness-to-advantage synthesis feels fresh through tactile repair mechanics, though Meridian's voyage setup leans generic for high-stakes context.</comment>
