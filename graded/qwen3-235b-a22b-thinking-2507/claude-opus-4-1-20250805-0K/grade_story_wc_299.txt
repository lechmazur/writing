<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "voice confidently uncertain" and embodied memory of Julie; flaw: band history compressed beyond emotional weight for full earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("longing as space waiting to be filled"); Accumulative lens holds through sensory accumulation to crystallize stakes.</comment>
