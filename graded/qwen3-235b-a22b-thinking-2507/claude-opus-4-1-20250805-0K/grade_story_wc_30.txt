<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kaine's embodied contradiction (mechanical/organic) shines through tactile details like "bronze meet skin," but the visitor's transformation lacks sufficient struggle—smelting occurs too smoothly without visible cost, weakening earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the prismatic visitor and "creel waited, patient and empty" crystallize identity's cost with undeniable conceptual weight under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Tidal atrium constrains choices (moon-triggered transparency enables furnace scene), while the creel charges the final image—environment and tool directly shape tactics and closure's emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully as moon approaches apex, but visitor's smelting lacks visceral struggle—pressure builds texturally yet the pivotal choice feels unearned without tangible resistance to contradictions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly through action: "constellation of possibilities" reweights identity without moralizing, while the creel's emptiness offers a resonant, non-literal answer to stability's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kaine's perceptual signature ("salt-metal tang," gear clicks) creates distinct rhythm, but the visitor's voice lacks differentiation—dialogue remains functional yet generic during high-stakes smelting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "mechanical heart beating with tides" exemplifies textural density. Minor abstraction in "words that couldn't settle" slightly dilutes momentum but avoids closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library-as-identity-forge feels inevitable, yet "smelting" concept isn't wholly transformed from trope—elevated by tidal mechanics but lacks a singular risk-taking turn that reconfigures expectation.</comment>
