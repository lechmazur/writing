<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong (archivist vs wild frontier), embodied via gear handling. Minor deduction for "sixth sense awakened" phrasing bordering diagnostic label-speak without immediate cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis: translocation promise forecloses escape path with conceptual cost ("carrying wild frontier back"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly; cost legible in "careful catalogued garden" versus dissolving into light.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mechanical Rainforest functions as micro-setting constraint: brass oaks' "rumbling warnings" guide navigation, gear's shifting teeth charge closure. Loom Tree redefines thought-into-thing conversion with tactile cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via gear insertion at Loom Tree—knowledge shift ("I built this place") forces stance crystallization. Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens; cost felt in fragmented memory versus "wild frontier" reclamation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "thoughts that moved like living creatures" versus "sitting still," avoiding moralizing. Final image ("chorus of probable miracles") reweights rebellion without stating moral, embracing complexity of constrained imagination.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "hollow branches singing different notes" filters world through mechanical consciousness. Rhythm modulates under pressure (shorter phrases at translocation), no head-hopping despite lyrical density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; "copper vines twisted through aluminum trunks" does triple duty (setting/character/theme). Final line "carrying the wild frontier" recharges motif with cost. Minor deduction for "sixth sense" abstraction in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via specific mechanics: probability streams manifest as wind-song frequencies, "wild frontier" literalized as mechanical growth. Risk-taking in Charged Poise closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
