<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction emerges in "she should file it properly" versus uncorking, but embodied emotion lacks granularity; micro-choices under pressure (setting type for "spaces between words") reveal values, though the "child/old woman/all selves" moment risks label-heavy abstraction without deeper physiological texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "Moth smiled, holding the page... let herself scatter" crystallizes the cost of dissolution with undeniable conceptual weight. Drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds perfectly—density escalates through frost patterns and whisper compression, narrowing options to rupture or preservation without causal gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The glass orchard isn't backdrop but active constraint: books ripening like fruit dictate Moth’s filing urgency, while frost patterns directly shape her printing tactics. Final image ("scatter into the morning frost") charges the setting with irreversible cost, fulfilling the 9+ gate by making the environment indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when the bottled whisper "destabilized her perfect system," forcing Moth to choose preservation or rupture. Escalation is driven by her agency (uncorking, printing silence), with visible cost in the library dissolving—though the pressure buildup slightly lacks visceral physicality during the climax beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "some systems are meant to be destabilized" is earned by the library’s dissolution, not stated. Final ice-crystal image reweights the premise with conceptual cost ("eternity would compress again"), avoiding moralizing while offering a resonant non-literal answer to the central question of perfection’s fragility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "arranging bottled whispers by... the precise shade of longing," with syntax mirroring Moth’s precision ("She was printing the compression itself"). Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure ("She uncorked the bottle. The whisper that emerged didn’t make a sound"), and frost-pattern elision is taught early and paid off in the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ruptured the air itself, creating a silence so profound" exemplifies high-density propulsion. One hairline slip: "harmonious distress" slightly muddles metaphor coherence in a high-pressure beat, but closure image ("morning frost that would form tomorrow") remains crystalline and unobscured.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms library tropes through specific mechanics (whispers by "shade of longing," crystalline apple trees). Risk-taking—lyric compression of time via "eternity folded into itself"—heightens stakes without gimmickry, synthesizing emotional truth (perfection’s cost) with fresh world logic in an inevitable, non-obvious arc.</comment>
