<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "three lifetimes? Or four?" and embodied emotion via pottery metaphors, but lacks overt contradictory action under peak pressure despite strong micro-choices. Final endurance is earned through glaze-settling realization with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: thrumming stops creating silence for "ghost of wings" cost, with solar-harmony insight crystallizing options. Accumulative lens holds throughout—density of sun-pattern observations tightens stakes without causal breaks. Orientation clear by 40 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lantern glass (micro-setting) constrains every choice and charges the final image with "faint golden tint," while hive arrangement actively reveals the temporal secret. Sensory hierarchy masterfully filtered through potter’s eye—cracks, light refraction, and smoke guide perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist’s observation (not decision), but solar-pattern realization narrows options by redefining "resistance" as harmony. Cost is unmistakable: thrumming cessation creates silence where only ghostly wings remain, charging the final image under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete actions—beekeepers’ patient dance, hive alignment—not abstraction. Final image ("wheel turning to rhythm of wings") reweights "kindness" as temporal anchor without moralizing, avoiding all thematic echo traps.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is pottery-infused ("movements precise as throwing porcelain"), with rhythmic control in smoke/flattening simile. Zero head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early via "fractured timelines" and paid off in temporal visions through the glass.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop in "resisted the great burning, resisted the timeline fractures" deducts 0.1, but otherwise flawless propulsion. Final line’s specificity ("shade of rebuilt hives") avoids abstraction, with no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms apocalypse tropes via pottery-beemaking synthesis; "phototropic to kindness" feels inevitable in hindsight. Emotional specificity in "kindness created temporal anchor" avoids sentimentality, with risk-taking (lyric structure) heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
