<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mira’s inherited burden versus her active choice to continue the tradition; embodied emotion in "breath caught" and palm-on-stone gestures avoids therapy-speak. Lacks deeper flaw-driven mistakes beyond sensitivity struggles.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "burden wasn’t just to preserve... but to ensure the future could still hear" crystallizes cost with conceptual weight. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, but diary discovery tightens options slightly late for 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage actively constrains movement ("narrowed forcing brush aside") and charges closure as "world’s new architecture." Stone walls as recording devices shape every choice, meeting 9+ gate for environment-driven tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen when Voss’s diary shifts Mira from passive discovery to active extraction; agency drives the single meaningful tightening. Cost is felt in exhaustion ("hours passed") but escalation lacks sharper pressure spikes for 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"The walls dream of us" reframes legacy through action (notebook placement), avoiding moralizing. Theme emerges from concrete particulars like "brown and brittle as autumn leaves," with no thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct acoustic perceptual signature ("thrumming with stored sound") and rhythmic control during high-pressure extraction. Cadence shifts perfectly from reflective to urgent without POV slippage or filter-verb stacks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "brittle as autumn leaves" shows textural specificity without cliché. Final line’s propulsion ("disappearing back into green passages") avoids figurative muddle. Minor register drift in "molecular structure" costs 0.1.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "last archivist" trope via echo cartographer premise; wall-memory concept feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking in making setting the active memory keeper elevates stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
