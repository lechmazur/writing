<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marina’s contradictory impulses (documenting vs. participating) culminate in her shard-offering choice, which forecloses passive observation with visible cost: "she understood now why she noticed... she was meant to witness." Interiority avoids labels via embodied details like "violet warmth spread through her skin."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: placing the shard reconfigures the bay’s role with conceptual cost ("sanctifications happen so slowly... only patient observers notice"). Accumulative lens holds throughout—displaced objects tighten the pattern toward epiphany. Orientation clear by 100 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The bay functions as micro-setting that charges closure: objects flicker through the shard, constraining Marina’s realization. Sensory details ("waves seemed to whisper") reflect urgency, avoiding symbolism. Final image ("cradling displaced treasures like prayers") reweights the bay’s purpose through prior particulars.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens: displaced objects (porch swing, wind chimes) deepen knowledge until the shard reveals their meaning as offerings. Dominant stake (understanding houses’ aliveness) narrows options when Marina realizes grief alters "molecular structure of a place." Cost is conceptual but unmistakable in the bay’s hush.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars—no moralizing. Final image reweights "hush" as active sanctification, answering the central question ("why houses feel alive") without stating a moral. Complexity in grief’s transformation avoids false equivalence (e.g., Hendersons’ daughter’s death anchors emotional truth).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("creeping changes," "cartographer of the imperceptible") modulates under pressure. Rhythm mirrors hush ("waves seemed to whisper rather than crash"); lyric compression taught early ("liminal hour") pays off at closure. Zero head-hopping; lexicon fits Marina’s perfume knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("active presence of quiet, burning away noise like fever burning infection"). Final line charges closure with layered meaning. Minor overwriting in "burning away the day’s accumulated noise" slightly dulls propulsion (-0.1), but no closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "shard of hush" transforms grief tropes into tangible quiet. Emotional specificity ("houses learned to be more than shelter") avoids sentimentality. Risk-taking elevates stakes—the bay’s hush as active force ("burning away noise") heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
