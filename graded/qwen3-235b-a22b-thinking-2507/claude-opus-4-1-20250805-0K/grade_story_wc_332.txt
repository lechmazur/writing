<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("spending her own capacity") embodied through visceral sensation ("warmth leaving her chest") avoids diagnostic label-speak; final renunciation earned by prior causality though micro-choices preceding climax lack sufficient contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: "some longings meant to remain ciphers" crystallizes stance with undeniable cost ("warmth leaving her chest"); orientation anchors by line 20, backstory fragment anchored by palette and alters present choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Recurring glass palette constrains choice (vitalization mechanics) and charges final image ("set down the palette"); "molten copper" water and "luminous absence" reweighted in ending avoid generic symbolism while shaping tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fulfilling grandmother's dream vs preserving self) tightens meaningfully as figure solidifies; escalation under Accumulative lens succeeds via whisper clarity and physical cost manifestation though pressure lacks active protagonist-driven deepening before climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Final line ("waiting for her own improbable beginning") reweights "improbable beginnings" with resonant ambiguity; avoids thematic echo despite "beautiful in incompleteness" proximity but nearly slips into stated wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("water turned to molten copper," "radio signal finding frequency") sustains Accumulative lens; rhythmic control modulates perfectly from lyrical dawn to tense climax without syntactic monotony or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops or figurative muddle; "warmth leaving her chest" delivers cost with crystalline propulsion though "luminous absence" repetition in para 1 and 10 creates minor redundancy without dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of light-painting mechanics with memory vitalization transforms familiar "unfinished love" trope; specific constraint (palette draining capacity) creates irreplaceable emotional calculus that avoids safety middle.</comment>
