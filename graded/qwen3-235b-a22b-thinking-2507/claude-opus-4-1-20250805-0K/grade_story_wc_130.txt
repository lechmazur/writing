<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in methodical vs emotional impulses, but final choice lacks embodied cost beyond conceptual acceptance. "Buried optimism bloom" shows growth, yet physical stakes of loss remain abstract despite strong micro-choices with pigments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly with conceptual cost: "Return suggests I've left" crystallizes irreversible redefinition of absence. Accumulative lens holds through fungal pattern escalation, though silence ritual motivation feels slightly under-anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cavern orchard's mineral water directly enables the magic system ("limestone-filtered water rich with memories"), but "eternal twilight" leans generic. Final image charged by glass eyes left on mosaic, though some sensory details lack urgency specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Morrow's agency placing eyes, narrowing options to conceptual acceptance. Cost is undeniable in Elias's "changed states" revelation, yet physical consequences of failure remain abstract despite strong knowledge deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete particulars: "loss was only ambiguous because humans insisted on binary definitions" reweights loss without moralizing. Final line reframes absence as "patient, persistent" presence—resonant non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "mathematics of emotion" lexicon and rhythmic long sentences. Minor filter verbs ("she could finally work") barely mar otherwise controlled voice under pressure. No head-hopping; focalization perfectly matches conjurer's analytical mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "bioluminescent fungi, each ring a calculation of what was versus what remained" exemplifies high-density phrasing. One slight redundancy ("weathered satchel, wrapped in velvet") prevents 9.0, but zero loops in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief as mathematical continuum ("disappearance and death were merely incomplete proofs") avoids tropes through specific mechanics. Emotional truth in "love finding new expressions" feels earned, though mentor's glass eyes slightly echo familiar tropes.</comment>
