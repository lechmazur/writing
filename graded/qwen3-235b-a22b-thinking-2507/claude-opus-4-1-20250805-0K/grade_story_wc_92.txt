<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thorne's embodied vigilance ("weathered fingers," navigating stones by memory) and micro-choice adjusting the quill holder by "a final degree" reveal contradictory impulses—duty vs. rebellion—without therapy-speak. Amara’s softening sternness crystallizes relationship pressure but lacks distinct voice differentiation in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "unstoppable as dawn" crystallizes the revolution’s irreversible initiation while lamps reignite, reconfiguring the fort’s power dynamics. Accumulative lens holds through coded angles’ density increase, with blackout timing tightening options decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The bronze quill holder (tool-as-setting) constrains Thorne’s final action and charges the closure image ("gleamed one last time"), but the fort’s sandstone walls remain atmospheric backdrop rather than actively shaping choices despite luminous twilight’s symbolic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Thorne’s agency: blackout enables sundial alignment, tightening options from observation to ignition. Cost is felt in "vigilance without purpose" dialogue and the quill holder’s return to innocence, reweighting the revolution’s quiet peril under accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "death by a thousand paper cuts" and the quill holder’s duality—freedom via accumulated small rebellions—without moralizing. Final image ("unstoppable as dawn") resonantly answers the central question by reweighting sparks as nurtured fire, avoiding tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV filters details through Thorne’s sentinel precision ("every stone’s position," "measured steps"), with rhythmic control in high-pressure beats ("winking hush"). Dialogue lacks distinct idiom between Thorne and Amara, converging on thematic exposition during blackout revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "half-painted sundial" and "cradle of sparks" earn density without muddle. Slight register drift in "conceptual repricing" equivalent ("method of igniting change without violence") barely avoids academic tone in peak tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms rebellion tropes through specific tools (sundial angles = 30°/45°/60°) and stakes ("selective blindness," "misfiled documents"). Risk-taking in silent revolution mechanics feels inevitable, with "winking hush" crystallizing a fresh inflection on resistance.</comment>
