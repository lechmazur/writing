<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses during pivotal realization; Marcus's internal conflict remains observational rather than active under pressure. Embodied emotion ("rough sandpaper of anxiety") borders on diagnostic phrasing without deeper contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "borrowed though it was" crystallizes the conceptual cost of temporal credit. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density increase in ad fragments reconfiguring time's meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Emerald silo constrains choice by resonating with the fragment's frequency, charging the final image where rust sky "rippled with unnamed hours." Micro-setting (urn fragment's texture) directly shapes Marcus's epiphany.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Marcus's assembly of messages, but escalation leans slightly passive ("fragment grew warm") rather than driven solely by his agency. Cost ("borrowed though it was") legibly charges the final image under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image reweights "garage sale advertisements" into thematic anchors without moralizing. "Texture... lived, felt, shared" offers non-literal answer to "how to measure time" through prior particulars, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "felt time's texture," but "temporal credit" and "experiential chronology" risk academic register. Rhythmic control excels in closure beat ("stepped into uncertain chronology").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Rough sandpaper of anxiety, silk of contentment, sticky tar of grief" stacks metaphors in high-pressure beat, reducing clarity. Otherwise clean propulsion; final line ("garage sale advertisements...") avoids closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel tropes through garage sale ads as encoded warnings. "THEY KNEW THE NUMBERS WOULD BETRAY US" in lamp ad feels inevitable in hindsight, synthesizing bureaucratic dread with domestic ephemera.</comment>
