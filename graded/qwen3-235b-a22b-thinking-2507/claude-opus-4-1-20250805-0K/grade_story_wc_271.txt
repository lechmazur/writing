<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in trauma-gardening synthesis; embodied panic ("tremor in chest") avoids therapy-speak. But "somatic markers" risks diagnostic over-articulation mid-crisis, nearly triggering Q1 penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: "She would continue her planting" crystallizes stance with felt cost ("dirt still dark beneath her fingernails"). Accumulative lens holds—density peaks in final paragraph with "violence"/"planting" parallel.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Arboretum constrains every choice: soil relocation, species placement, and the cedar's bark as anchor for panic. Final image of "dirt beneath fingernails" charges closure by making growth visceral and irreplaceable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through somatic calibration ("nervous system recalibrating") rather than external threat. Cost is ever-present grief made legible when she tucks away the photograph—quiet but undeniable under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "stubborn act of cultivation" vs. "violence," crystallized in final line: "growth against erasure." No moralizing—resonance built from orchids/phosphorus juxtaposition and jade plant propagation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>Perceptual signature ("plants she touched seemed to understand") filters all observation. Rhythm modulates with stress: short phrases during panic ("She froze. Not from fear"), flowing cadence in greenhouse thoughts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "white orchids everywhere, then white phosphorus" compresses horror with surgical precision. Slight register drift in "somatic markers" (clinical vs. poetic voice), but offset by "dirt beneath fingernails" closing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma recovery via ecological succession—no "healing garden" clichés. Risk-taking in making cultivation the active counter to erasure ("life insisted on returning, slower, quieter") feels inevitable by closure.</comment>
