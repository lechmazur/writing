<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "blessed silence in her throat" versus new burden of choice, but final distribution plan lacks causal buildup from prior self-isolation; "psychological safety" phrasing risks modern jargon in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with "She could lie. She could withhold. She could choose," but tin box discovery ("rang metallic") feels coincidental rather than causal, weakening escalation's final tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hanging orchard functions as essential micro-setting—its sideways growth constrains movement and charges the final image ("speak sideways too"), though storm description leans generic in early paragraphs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally from ruined relationships to ravine descent, but cure's success lacks sufficient struggle; the truffle mixture works instantly without visible cost during preparation, muting escalation's pressure peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "fractured grace" and orchard imagery, but "psychological safety didn't require dishonesty—merely discretion" edges toward thematic echo in reflection, risking sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("truffle rake catching on storm-bent apple branches"), but "occlude certain neurological pathways" introduces clinical diction jarringly during high-stress excavation, disrupting voice consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding; "earth and copper and something older" achieves textural specificity. Minor deduction for "aromatic with earth and rain" (redundant sensory overlap) in critical truffle discovery beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Victorian alienism with neuroplasticity avoids trope; "moral insanity" reframing feels researched. Risk in making truthfulness the affliction pays off through orchard's sideways growth motif.</comment>
