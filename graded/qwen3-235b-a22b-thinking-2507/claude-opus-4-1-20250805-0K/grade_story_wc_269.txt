<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (scientific duty vs ancestral truth-seeking) manifest in micro-choices like discarding the atlas; embodied emotion via tapping rhythms avoids diagnostic labels. Final dive choice earned through gradual realization with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options (surface vs submerged reality) with undeniable conceptual cost in "paths transcribed" realization. Accumulative lens holds through patterned escalation; minor deduction for no visible physical forfeiture despite strong conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Monitoring station functions as micro-setting: glass enables tapping, floor panels reveal truth. Coral-as-town actively constrains choices (alignment attempts) and charges final image where reflection superimposes Lena's face over transformed Mooreton.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (perception vs reality) tightens through Lena's agency—tapping, aligning atlas, interpreting shadows. Escalation via deepening knowledge (coral as architecture) forecloses denial path; conceptual cost lands in "translated into reef and bone" realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through coral's metamorphosis metaphor without moralizing. Final image ("water that remembered everything") provides non-literal answer to central question, reweighting "death" as patience. Zero thematic echo; complexity in "fossil fuel ban came too late... but just in time."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: Lena notices through touch/sound (glass sings, plastic whispers) not sight. Rhythmic control under pressure—tapping cadence shifts with realization—teaches pattern early. Zero head-hopping; voice modulates from lonely to determined.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "white as funeral bones" shows textural specificity. Final line's rhythm ("remembered everything, forgot nothing") propels closure. Minor deduction for "periodically eternal" abstraction, but grandmother's diary contextualizes it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms climate fiction tropes via coral-as-architecture premise. Risk-taking with quiet ending pays off: "drifting between worlds" synthesizes emotional truth. Specificity in "three short, three long" rhythm avoids genericness; emotional complexity in seeing "death where there was patience."</comment>
