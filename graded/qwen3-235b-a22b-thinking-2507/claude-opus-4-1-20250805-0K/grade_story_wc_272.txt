<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in embodied micro-choices: trembling fingers tracing tarot box while questioning reality, charcoal sketching as active reclamation. No stock phrasing; grief manifests as "cracked and luminous" laughter. Final fragmented self-portrait earns endurance through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "every broken thing was whole" crystallizes Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost legible in "grief for her old way of seeing" and lighthouse beam blazing—a visible transformation of the dead beacon. Lens holds from opening disorientation to final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges closure: collapsing lighthouse walls force Marina’s shift from despair to sketching on tarot cards. Salt-stained belly, dead beacon charcoal, and upward-falling glass aren’t backdrop but active pressure. Final beam’s "impossible directions" reweights environment as essential motif.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Marina’s agency: rhetorical questions evolve from despair ("What good is prophecy?") to active redesign ("untangle threads"). Cost crystallizes when walls "embrace" her—a felt reconfiguration. One deepening (shifting from painting to sketching) suffices, though rhetorical device’s pressure could be sharper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally: "Who says darkness isn’t another kind of light?" reweights fragmentation as wholeness without moralizing. Central question ("Why assume reality should hold still?") resolves through the final image of multi-directional light, avoiding thematic echo while charging closure with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature dominates: "books breathing dust," "faces drifting," "glass fell upward" filter reality through Marina’s fractured vision. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short phrases during collapse ("The walls pressed close enough to touch")—but "luminous with grief" slightly overwrites emotional texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion falters minimally: "cracked and luminous with grief" risks abstract overlay, and "cubist nightmare" leans generic. Otherwise, zero loops; sentences like "Marina began sketching... using charcoal from the lighthouse’s long-dead beacon fire" do triple duty advancing plot, character, and setting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ingenuity in transforming fragmentation trope: broken tarot cards don’t symbolize chaos but "all possible states simultaneously." Emotional specificity avoids abstraction—"crestfallen months showed in the shadow of her jaw." Risk-taking (reality folding inward) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "necessary darkness" borders on familiar phrasing.</comment>
