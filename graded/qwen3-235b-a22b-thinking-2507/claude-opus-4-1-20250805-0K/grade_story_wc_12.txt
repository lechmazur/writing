<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s contradictory impulses—priestly duty vs. artistic silence—manifest in micro-choices like footfall placement to "plumb resonance." Woman’s possession as "vacuum of intention" avoids cliché through embodied stillness, though demon’s "I am assumption" speech flirts with thematic echo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: demon dissolves via illumination ("could no longer bear transparency"), cost crystallized in "her first independent breath." Lens holds—Accumulative pressure via sound-layering directly causes unraveling. Cost proof: gasp and palette’s transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cathedral acoustics actively constrain tactics (Marcus "finding frequencies that made stones confess"). Palette’s evolution—from indigo doubt to "color of questions"—charges final image. Dimensional anchor functions as micro-setting that resolves possession.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (dissolving unexamined assumptions) tightens via Marcus’s rhetorical spiral: "What assumes assumption itself cannot be assumed away?" Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens; cost legible in woman’s gasp and dissolved indigo.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (looped words as "mandala"), not abstraction. Final image ("silence, properly decorated, could unravel any truth") reweights doubt as liberation. Near-penalty for "true exorcism didn’t cast out demons—it illuminated them," but framed as earned realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Marcus notices "frequencies that made stones confess." Rhythmic control under pressure—short clauses during unraveling ("The woman gasped"). Muffled dialogue serves intentional tone modulation, not filter-verb artifact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Near-flawless density: "silence wasn’t absence but perfect organization" does triple duty (theme, character, stakes). Minor artifact in "vacuum of intention" (metaphor clash), but no closure impact. Zero loops; propulsion accelerates with unraveling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms exorcism via sonic architecture—loop pedal as tool to "illuminate assumptions." Emotional specificity in demon as "habit dressed in terror’s clothing." Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry; synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
