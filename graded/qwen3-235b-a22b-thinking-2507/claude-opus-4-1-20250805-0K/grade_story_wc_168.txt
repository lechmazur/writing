<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: expertise vs shattered confidence embodied in trembling hands handling the box. Final choice to record the message earns closure through prior causality—his "bargain" realization transforming burden into compass. No therapy-speak; grief transmuted into action feels viscerally earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: box becoming "a compass" crystallizes stance with undeniable cost ("weight transform" amid darkness). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each reflection deepens the central stake without causal turns. Cost proof is explicit: "teaching meant revealing his own cracks" forecloses isolation with felt sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The porcelain box functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—moonlight seeping through fractures enables the climax ("letting light pass through them"). Ridge path constrains choice ("steps measured against mountain's breathing"), while celestial bodies generate the pressure point for Marcus's realization. Environment actively shapes the thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: celestial conjunction ("dance that wouldn't repeat for twenty years") forces crystallization of whether Marcus bears others' innocence. Cost is unmistakable in the descent—"tucked it inside his jacket" shows carrying transformed grief forward. One deepening suffices, but the celestial clock elevates it beyond static reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: kintsugi box fractures become "words in a language," rejecting moralizing. Final image—box as compass against his chest—offers resonant non-literal answer to "bargained innocence" without stating a moral. Wisdom arises from concrete scars, avoiding pseudo-profundity; ambiguity lingers in "so maybe they never have to."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful: Marcus notices "wind patterns in flame" and "molten polyester" as only a firefighter would. Under stress, syntax compresses ("He opened the box") while maintaining poetic texture. Zero head-hopping; every detail filters through his scarred expertise, with rhythm mirroring emotional shifts from measured steps to urgent descent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops—each sentence does triple duty ("destruction and creation shared the same violent tenderness"). Figurative language stays coherent ("silver roads" moonlight ties to ridge path), with no register drift during peak beats. Final paragraph’s rhythm accelerates toward "ready finally to share," proving propulsion without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms firefighter tropes through kintsugi-box specificity: "bargained innocence" reframes heroism as traded vulnerability. Celestial timing isn’t gimmicky—the 20-year conjunction parallels his career span, creating organic pressure. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; emotional truth avoids middle-ground hedging.</comment>
