<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal carving scene; "perpetually learning" stated but not tested through meaningful trade-offs. Final understanding feels earned yet cost remains conceptual rather than embodied. Grandmother's backstory anchors motivation but doesn't create present-tense conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with archway as eternal threshold, but cost ("shaped like her own driftwood") is oblique rather than legible. Accumulative lens holds through density buildup, yet storm's shift from threat to "conductor" lacks causal grounding in the pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Archway actively constrains choices: its physics (shelter, turbine-hum) forces the GPS failure pause and becomes Marina's compass. Driftwood's physicality directly shapes the sculpture's emergence, charging the final image where the archway "waited for the next storm to bring another soul."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes (creative purpose) tighten through slide's vision, but pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation—Marina accepts insights rather than wrestling with them. Cost remains conceptual (lost GPS functionality) without tangible forfeiture altering her tactics in the scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through artisans' specific gestures (shipwright's grain knowledge), avoiding moralizing. However, "perpetually learning meant more than accumulating knowledge" triggers Q5 penalty for thematic echo, slightly undermining the resonant final image of the archway as threshold.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("wind sang its turbine-hum," "driftwood shifted") persists under pressure. Minor register drift in "perpetually learning" phrasing slightly violates sculptor's plausible lexicon, preventing 9.0 despite otherwise controlled rhythmic modulation during carving.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops in peak beats, but "storm outside wasn't chaos but conductor" creates mixed metaphor violating physical logic (conductor implies control; storms are chaotic). Coherence break triggers -0.4 deduction, though not in closure beat. High density otherwise sustains propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "artist inspired" trope through archway's physics and timewoven mechanics. Future potter humming same song offers fresh inflection, but "wood remembers" cliché slightly dilutes originality. Risk-taking in temporal layering heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
