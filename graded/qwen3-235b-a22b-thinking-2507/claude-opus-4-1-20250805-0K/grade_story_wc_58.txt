<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority excels through concrete actions (thread-pulling, air-writing) but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; Marcus's projection reveals Elara's observational drive without testing her choices or flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: Marcus counting dead stars' light crystallizes the conceptual cost of futility, with "healing as map" reweighting the premise under Accumulative lens; orientation clear by paragraph 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Autumn garden functions as micro-setting: frost-edged roses and dry fountain constrain Elara's perception and charge the final image ("shadows deepening with winter"), though environment doesn't alter her tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes (mapping loss to understand healing) signaled early, but escalation lacks meaningful tightening; the realization about healing as topography deepens knowledge without narrowing options or raising cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "palace carpet's unraveling" reweights healing as pattern-revealing in the final cartographer image, avoiding moralizing while charging the closure with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lonesome splendor of endings") and rhythmic control elevate pressure; lyrical compression taught early ("souls halfway to wherever souls go") pays off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "phantom loaves" and "needles through absent fabric" exemplify high-density imagery; minor scaffold in paragraph 2 ("She wrote obituaries... learning geography") slightly dulls early momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes through "explained absences" and cartographer metaphor; emotional specificity in "frost that would never quite commit to killing" avoids genericness while committing to the premise's implications.</comment>
