<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concretely embodied in micro-choices like weaving faster under pressure; contradictory impulses (preserving vs. adapting history) drive closure with felt cost. Minor flaw: lack of flaw-driven errors slightly softens stakes, but Elara's competence remains credible within scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: stepping through the doorway crystallizes "absences as presences" with undeniable conceptual cost ("cease to exist"). Hybrid lens holds cleanly through escalation, though single tightening lacks causal depth; thirteenth chime deadline provides sufficient pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ceremonial rope functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (weaving configurations) and charges closure (knot coordinates). Sensory precision ("wax seal pulsed warm") reflects archivist's priorities; environment evolves causally as fibers activate. No white-room syndrome despite abstract theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes materialize viscerally through thirteenth chime deadline: uncovering merged borders vs. entrapment. Escalation driven by Elara's agency (weaving new patterns), but internal conflict (fear vs. curiosity) remains underdeveloped. Cost is unmistakable in "trapping her here—or releasing her into merged space."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through rope's negative-space map: "absences as presences" avoids moralizing via concrete action (stepping through doorway). Final image reweights premise without stating moral; embraces paradox through "clarity that embraced contradiction." No thematic echo or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fingers finding seal by instinct") and rhythmic control under pressure ("fingers moved faster now"). Compression taught early pays off in closure; no head-hopping. Slight register drift in "adapted it to reveal what wasn't" barely touches peak tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("shadows cast by objects already removed" conveys history and theme). Propulsion accelerates with chime countdown. Figurative language sparse but potent; final line ("having never chimed thirteen") charges closure without muddle. Minor abstraction in "fables of absence" compensated by action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: archival work as active revelation of absences via rope mechanics. Emotional truth in "clarity embracing paradox" avoids generic novelty. Risk-taking (Conceptual Repricing closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "memory-glass" and "rectangular gaps" provide verifiable specificity.</comment>
