<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus's embodied guilt ("surgical scars still ached") and contradictory impulses (seeking forgiveness while doubting he deserves it) create authentic interiority. Final choice lacks sufficient prior causality—his immediate compliance with the woman's request feels under-earned despite strong micro-choices like pocketing the baseball. "Diagnostic label-speak" avoided, but motivation thinness caps high-band entry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with legible cost in Marcus's final walk ("carrying only the strange, terrible gift of still being able to feel"). Time travel convenience slightly undermines causality at the climax beat. Orientation clear by 42 words; Hybrid lens (Situational pressure forcing stance crystallization) holds through closure without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Bioluminescent lake functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (paths appearing/disappearing with light) and charges the final image ("ghost becoming light"). Baseball pocketed as Marcus steps forward reweights the recurring object. "Cathedral of stone" generic descriptor prevents 9.0, but specificity anchors universals without symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (kindling empathy without memory) tightens when the labyrinth paths manifest victims' kin, forcing Marcus's agency. Cost legible in his irreversible step onto the bridge. Escalation driven by protagonist's choice under Hybrid lens, but the woman's exposition slightly softens pressure—could heighten moral calculus earlier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: baseball's impossible date reframes time, labyrinth paths embody empathy's labor. Final image ("another ghost becoming light") offers non-literal answer to forgiveness question. "Forgiveness isn't about the forgiven" skirts thematic echo but avoids moralizing through Marcus's embodied cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature via medical/sci-fi lexicon ("neural pathways," "memory extraction ports") and rhythmic control in high-pressure beats. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during the baseball reveal. Minor register drift in "delicately robust" descriptor prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("billions of bioluminescent organisms painting the water in shifting constellations"). "Delicately robust like pressed flowers" slightly mixed metaphor in peak beat prevents 9.0. Final line’s cadence shift ("a man with no memory of his sins...") delivers propulsion without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory extraction and bioluminescent empathy-labyrinth transforms familiar tropes. "Jaded wonder" tone avoids safety middle through Marcus's visceral ache. Time travel risks derivative premise but redeemed by specific emotional calculus (guilt without memory). Lacks one irreplaceable risk-taking element for 9.0.</comment>
