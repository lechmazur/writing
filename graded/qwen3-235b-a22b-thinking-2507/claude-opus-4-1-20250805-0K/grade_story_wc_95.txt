<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marlowe's embodied contradiction—mechanical arm tracing coded angles while advocating "intellectual jazz"—reveals values hierarchy under pressure. "Diplomatically fierce" shown via dialogue tension, not labels. Slight deduction for "revolution" epiphany bordering on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: completed light-sundial crystallizes revolution's possibility/constraint. Accumulative lens holds—each syllogism deepens coded pressure. Cost legible in trembling needle card and mechanical arm's final secret-keeping click.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Brook's gurgle "approves" dialogue; glass prism light scattering directly enables coded language. Mechanical arm constrains choice (trembling during traces) and charges closure via light trails. Micro-setting essential to every turn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through deepening: "intellectual anarchy" challenge reframes destruction as valuable, narrowing options to dialogue-as-revolution. Cost felt in needle card's tremor and expended intellectual exertion. Agency-driven under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sundial construction metaphor until final paragraph's explicit "questions... become destinations" violates organic emergence. Strong resonance otherwise via light-trail patterns reweighting inquiry, but thematic echo triggers penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: Marlowe notices angles/light refraction, Reeves' translucent portfolio signals status. Syntax compresses under stress ("Forty-three degrees... seventeen degrees..."). Zero head-hopping; voice modulates from clinical to lyrical.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dignified chaos" repetition is intentional motif. Sentences do triple duty (e.g., "brass fingers leaving trails of light" advances character/setting/theme). Final image avoids sentimentality with mechanical arm's "soft click."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms philosophical duel via coded angles and "intellectual jazz" metaphor. Fresh synthesis: revolution through syllogisms. Risks conceptual density but closure remains legible. Slight deduction as "questions as destinations" edges toward familiar academic trope.</comment>
