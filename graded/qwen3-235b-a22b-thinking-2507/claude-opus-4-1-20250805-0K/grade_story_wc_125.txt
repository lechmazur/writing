<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (truth-seeking vs moral burden) act simultaneously; final renunciation of the rope earns closure with visceral cost in "hollows he could taste" and bone-deep texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: leaving the rope reconfigures Marcus's role from seeker to keeper, crystallized in "carrying time's texture in his bones" amid singing walls.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Terra-cotta grotto functions as micro-setting—clay texture reveals history, constrains choices (rope placement), and charges closure via singing walls, avoiding postcard description through active revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Marcus's agency ("Show me another layer") deepens moral stakes; cost is legible in visceral reactions (tasting hollows, bone-deep texture) as each layer compounds the weight of impossible choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—rope fibers, terra-cotta layers—not abstraction; final line reweights time's texture as "accumulated weight of broken hearts" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("violent poem of escape," "recycled air") with rhythmic control; compression under pressure ("Time had texture here") taught early and paid off in closure's cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "hemp still bearing oils from desperate hands" exemplifies high-density textural specificity that advances character and stakes without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</comment><comment>Transforms time-travel trope through moral texture—rope as inherited consequence, energy beings as consumers of complexity—avoiding abstraction with judge brother's penance and daughter's silence.</comment>
