<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied through crystal whispers vs. music yearning; "excruciary gentle" trait visibly constrains action with cost. Minor deduction: head priest's advice slightly tell-y but redeemed by integration into decision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost ("stone in her chest" transformed). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density; sunrise timing crystallizes stance without causality breaks. Orientation clear by 40 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt constrains choice (silence enables perception) and charges final image ("whispers grew stronger"). Petrichor scent triggers memory that alters tactics—micro-setting functions as environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via protagonist's agency: invitation forces crystallization of silence/music duality. Cost legible in "bearing loss meant carrying it until transformed"—felt price shapes final image under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through crystal acoustics and petrichor, not moralizing. Final line "silence itself could sing" reweights premise without stating moral—earned through specific sensory work, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("crystals hummed with absorbed rainfall") modulates with emotional intensity. Rhythmic control shifts from glacial hush to lyrical sunrise; zero register drift despite high-pressure reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "excruciatingly gentle" avoids therapy-speak by anchoring to quill action. Final line crystallizes theme without cliché—figurative language serves character not decoration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms loss trope through sanctuary's acoustic physics and scribe role. Emotional specificity in "dreams that changed shape but never died" avoids generic redemption; risk-taking in quiet closure pays off.</comment>
