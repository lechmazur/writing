<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Marina's pure altruism lacks internal conflict; living characters remain functional but underdeveloped despite strong motivation for collective action. Tom Okafor's dialogue reveals trust without deepening his individuality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds perfectly: chalk messages build pressure toward Charged Poise closure. Cost is unmistakable in Marina's fading and the bell's materialization, anchoring the resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floating arches constrain choice (Marina's observation vantage) and charge closure as bell-ringing location. "Brambled hope" and bell's transformation exemplify micro-setting charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Marina's agency (message writing) tightens options until families tear fences. Cost is legible in her dissolution and the six-month struggle, reweighting the dominant unity stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "strangers built this world" message without moralizing. Final bell-ringing offers resonant answer to suspicion vs. family, reweighting prior conflict through action not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "nebula of respite" and "brambled hope" – ghostly, poetic yet precise. Rhythmic control intensifies during message writing with no head-hopping despite multi-POV shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "warm somehow" subtly charges the bell's materialization. Final line’s "sometimes at dawn new messages still appeared" achieves lyrical propulsion without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Nebula of respite" transforms fungal networks into fresh emotional metaphor. Risk-taking (ghost as plot engine) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable through Pomona-7’s specificity.</comment>
