<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Marina's embodied grief via wildflowers and coffee grounds shows contradictory impulses—clinging to fragments while understanding the necessity of buried pain. Final choice to return vials but keep one earned by visceral memory reintegration, though Elena's erased face lacks deeper exploration of amnesia's psychological cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "some memories deserved their burial" crystallizes the trade-off between healing and truth. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—patterns accumulate to irreversible stance shift—but cost proof slightly softens as emotional toll remains implied rather than physically manifested.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Gravity pockets function as micro-setting that actively constrains choice (digging in warped earth) and charges the final image (lantern flames bending toward grief). Salt chamber's "gleaming silence" evolves from observation space to thematic anchor, with coffee grounds providing tactile specificity that drives the entire investigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation through Accumulative lens is masterful: coffee patterns → cemetery dig → vial revelation tightens the dominant stake (reclaiming memories) into an unavoidable moral calculus. Cost legibility shines in the vial selection moment, though the whale's causal role as grief-magnet slightly over-explains the premise's mechanics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars—vials as compressed grief, salt coffins as societal denial—with no moralizing. Final lantern image ("flames bent toward the cemetery") resonantly answers the central question about memory's weight without stating it, avoiding sentimentality through concrete physics of sorrow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: Marina notices gravity anomalies through occupational lens (lantern flames, coffee grounds), with syntax tightening during high-pressure beats ("She began to dig"). Rhythmic control elevates tension as salt formations "spiral upward in defiance of natural law" mirrors her unraveling grief.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts; every line propels atmosphere or character. "Cremated ashes sometimes drifted upward like snow" exemplifies lethal concision—concrete image that establishes world rules while charging emotional stakes. Closure beat ("eyes that remembered how to grieve") avoids cliché through precise physicality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope via gravity-warped memory storage: whale as literalized sorrow elevates beyond metaphor. Emotional specificity in "grief had been unbearable after Elena drowned during gravity reversal" avoids abstraction, though the city's memory-extraction premise edges close to familiar sci-fi tropes without deeper societal exploration.</comment>
