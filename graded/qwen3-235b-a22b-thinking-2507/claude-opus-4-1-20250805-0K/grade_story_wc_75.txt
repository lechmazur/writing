<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses ("dread" vs "fierce tenderness") manifest through concrete actions like tracing initials amid blurring walls; closure choice to document despite irreversible loss earns Earned Stasis with visible cost in mineral water erasure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: rosewater scent → droplets → blurring wall creates inevitable pressure escalation; Charged Poise closure crystallizes with "mineral water began to blur a section" as cost, foreclosing preservation options while charging documentation as resistance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Opera glass constrains choices (only emerald lens reveals hidden pigments) and charges closure ("transforming loss into legacy"); grotto's evolving state (ice chunks crashing, weeping walls) directly alters Marta's tactics, making environment indispensable to the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Thaw-driven pressure escalates through sensory countdown (scent → droplets → blurring) narrowing options to frantic documentation; Marta's agency in tracing initials while walls dissolve creates tangible cost, reweighting "resistance against erasure" as the only viable stance with visible stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars ("K for Katarin, who sang harvest songs") without abstraction; final image of lens "transforming loss into legacy" reweights displacement as conceptual repricing where documentation becomes legacy—not moralizing but earned through Marta's actions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("alphabet of belonging etched in carbon") filters grotto details through archivist's lens; rhythmic control peaks in urgency ("Droplets began forming") while maintaining voice consistency, with no head-hopping in single-POV structure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; high density where "rosewater dread" evolves into tangible cost; figurative language ("palimpsest of memory") serves pressure without muddle, culminating in propulsion toward "mineral water began to blur" closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of displacement through bread-initial ritual and opera glass; avoids abstraction via specific customs ("P for Pavel, keeper of clockwork designs"), with risk-taking in quiet closure where documentation becomes legacy without sentimentality.</comment>
