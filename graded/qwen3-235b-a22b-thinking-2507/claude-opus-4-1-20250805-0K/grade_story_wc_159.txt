<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (methodical ritual vs urgent capture) drive the climax; embodied grief in "tears gathered" and whispered repetitions avoids label-speak; flaw (obsession with preservation) implicitly costs her connection to the present.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: bamboo's split (visible cost) crystallizes the shift from "monuments to loss" to "bridges to remembrance" with conceptual cost; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density increase in the chime's resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting (cracked bamboo) constrains the climax—its widening crack forces Mira's race against time; the glass orchid's pliable stem becomes a tool that directly charges the final image of Solmieth's preserved glow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mira's agency: lighting the lamp (deliberate choice) accelerates the bamboo's split, narrowing her window to capture the name; the felt cost (shattered chime) alters her understanding of preservation's purpose irreversibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the orchid's transformation—from "extinct beauties" to "rebellion against oblivion"—without moralizing; the final image reweights "deserted marvels" as active resistance, answering the central question through Solmieth's glowing pulse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("foxglove regret," "molecular structure") reflects Mira's scientific reverence; rhythm modulates from measured precision to urgent fragments ("Solmieth, Solmieth, Solmieth") under pressure without syntactic drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats: "heated the orchid's stem until pliable" compresses action into vivid causality; no figurative muddle despite dense imagery ("crack spreading like lightning through wood" serves physics, not ornament).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms the "last librarian" trope through specific mechanics (acoustic orchids, bamboo resonance); emotional truth in preserving a *sound* of a name makes loss visceral, avoiding abstract nostalgia.</comment>
