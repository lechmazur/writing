<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias' embodied stress (shaking hands, wilting skin) grounds interiority, but final choice lacks contradictory impulses; his smile after Vex's death shows no personal cost despite world-changing stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with sunlight piercing the ceiling, but cost proof fails—no on-page personal sacrifice for Elias despite the world's restoration, violating Q2's cost requirement.</comment>
<question>3</question><question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Resonance chamber actively constrains choices: copper walls amplify vibrations enabling the climax, while rusting tools create tangible pressure; mirrors charge the final image by refracting light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Elias' truthful speech versus Vex's lies accelerating decay, but climax relies on coincidence (Vex's intrusion) rather than Elias' agency deepening the conflict under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through mending mechanics—"dawn to be shared" crystallizes the central question without moralizing—but "seed of honesty" phrasing risks thematic echo in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "honey-tongued tar-hearted" for Vex, "sung silver threads" for repairs; rhythmic control shifts from precise to urgent during the symphony buildup.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but "understanding flooding through him like morning rain" mixes incompatible metaphors (flood vs. rain), slightly muddling the pivotal realization beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of repair-as-truth-telling transforms tropes, but "tinker's wonder" phrasing leans toward safety-hedging rather than bold risk-taking in the resolution.</comment>
