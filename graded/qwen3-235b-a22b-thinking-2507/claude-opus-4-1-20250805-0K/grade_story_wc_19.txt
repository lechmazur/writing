<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (bunker claustrophobia vs. trellis expansion) drives tangible micro-choices like vial-filling under inversion pressure; embodied emotions avoid labels ("claustrophobia stretched and dissolved"). Father's off-page presence limits relationship crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: Mira's descent with vials crystallizes the cost (dissolved childhood fear) and reconfigured stakes ("safety could expand"). Accumulative lens holds through inversion's sensory shift, but grandmother's prophecy ("bloom again next year") slightly softens final cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Trellis setting constrains choices (inversion timing) and charges closure; the doll's physical cracking enables the silence-garden climax. "Honey-copper sweetness" of silence exemplifies sensory specificity that shapes Mira's collection tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via gravity inversion's clock ("seven minutes... forty minutes remained"), forcing Mira's urgent vial-filling. Pressure grows texturally through sprouting silence flavors, but the father's bunker conflict remains abstract without on-page tactical cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: doll's sprout reconfigures "safety" from bunker compression to silence-garden expansion. Final image ("children of builders learned to fly") resonates without moralizing, reweighting the opening claustrophobia through earned experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in sensory lexicon ("gilded hush," "frost made of whispers") reflecting Mira's shift from recycled-air fear to wonder. Tense stability falters slightly during inversion ("clouds rushed upward—or she fell upward—") but serves disorientation purpose.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; "porcelain doll cracked... tendril emerged" shows propulsion. Minor register drift in "intangibly tangible" (clinical for POV) in high-pressure beat costs 0.2. Final line’s "silence grew wild" crystallizes theme without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "harvesting silence" trope through literal crystallization and generational conflict (bunker vs. trellis). Risk-taking in silence-as-presence pays off with tactile specificity; avoids abstraction via vial flavors ("pause between heartbeats").</comment>
