<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority anchored by concrete cues (tears catching light, stone's weight) avoids therapy-speak; contradictory impulses (doubt vs. persistence) drive micro-choices like placing the stone. "Luminous regret" skirts label territory but gains embodiment through prismatic tears and physical cost of waiting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "luminous regret for all the years" crystallizes the temporal price paid. Accumulative lens holds throughout—shadow's patterned migration tightens options without causal gaps, and the final transcription choice forecloses passive observation with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The river stone functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: its shadow bookends the story while constraining Mira's choices (triggering metamorphosis when placed on desk). Sensory hierarchy—light refracted through bio-glass, stone's smoothness—filters urgency through her archivist's gaze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through accumulative pressure: the shadow's decades-long migration reweights hope from abstract concept to tangible cost. Mira's agency in transcribing the journey forecloses skepticism with felt regret, making the "waiting darkness" a visible price that alters her purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through shadow collecting "moments of hope" rather than statement; the final image of the stone's bound shadow reweights the entire premise as a non-literal answer to preserving intangible legacies. Avoids sentimentality by grounding wisdom in Mira's embodied transcription labor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer," light/shadow obsession) modulates under pressure—syntax compresses during metamorphosis ("She placed... activated... synced"). Purposeful elision of grandmother's backstory pays off via the dream vision, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion through concrete verbs ("hummed," "trembling," "transcribe"). Figurative language sparse but potent ("dark aurora"), avoiding muddle in peak beats. Final line's "quiet witness" recharges the stone motif with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-tech and legacy: shadow as carrier of hope transforms ghost tropes through specific archivist logic. Risk-taking in quiet climax (transcribing vs. action) heightens stakes by making preservation an active, costly choice that feels inevitable.</comment>
