<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marlow's contradictory impulses (hiding vs embracing synesthesia) manifest concretely in her handling of the journal and key; her final vow "I will no longer hide behind truth" earns endurance with visible cost in altered perception. Elena's absence deepens motivation without summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: lanterns pulsing in response to Marlow's vow crystallizes her stance with undeniable conceptual cost ("everything had changed"). Orientation clear by paragraph 1; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The sunken library’s brine and bloated volumes actively constrain Marlow’s movement and choices; the brass lantern and key tag function as micro-settings charging the final image ("lanterns no longer merely illuminated darkness—they signified doorways"). No generic placeholder details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Marlow reads "I hid behind truth," forcing her to confront her own avoidance. Agency drives escalation (her ritual speech), with cost legible in the immediate perceptual shift: "Her lanterns no longer merely illuminated darkness."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ritual action, not statement: "the color of sound wasn’t one thing—it was everything" reweights prior material without moralizing. "Hiding behind truth" transforms from metaphor to lived reality through Elena’s journal and Marlow’s vow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in synesthetic details ("words a different hue only Marlow could see"); rhythm modulates from lyrical discovery to staccato ritual. No POV leakage; voice remains consistent under pressure during the key-raising climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "meteor hush" motif avoids cliché through sensory specificity. Minor deduction for "bloated volumes floated" (simultaneity error in sequential action), but no muddle in peak ritual beats where prose crystallizes pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Synesthesia trope transformed via drowned-library setting and sensory "vows" as living contracts. The hotel key’s evolution from souvenir to frequency-unlocker feels inevitable, with risk-taking (lyric structure) heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
