<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction manifests in embodied micro-choices: Kaspar's fidgeting with copper pieces while decoding threads reveals simultaneous guilt and hope. His final self-forgiveness earns through prior causality—altering the tapestry directly reconfigures his understanding—avoiding stock phrasing. The cost of releasing guilt is legible in "carrying the wisdom winnowed from the labyrinth's silence." Only minor BRR reflection drift slightly exceeds 20% but anchors to tactile cues.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Kaspar's self-forgiveness crystallizes options with undeniable cost ("carrying the wisdom..."), under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear by 40 words with concrete anchors (frozen rain, archway vibration). The thunder's "distant, patient, eternal" final image reweights stakes through conceptual cost without resolution. No causality breaks; density escalation perfectly tightens the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth constrains choice (thread-decoding mechanics) and charges the final image—Kaspar's reflection in the queen's surface reweights redemption. Sensory hierarchy is POV-perfect: a chess tutor notices "distorted futures" in reflections, not weather. "Fierce repose" avoids cliché by evolving from "suspended raindrops" to earned stillness. Micro-setting (copper pieces) alters tactics when placed as an offering.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kaspar's agency: pulling threads narrows options from decoding to active revision, culminating in the copper offering. The cost—releasing guilt to serve future pupils—is unmistakable in "carrying the wisdom winnowed." Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) tightens through one meaningful deepening (tapestry alteration), avoiding static conflict. No coincidence resolves; the woven hush complicates but doesn't solve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete particulars: the tapestry's "frayed threads" embody regret, while "winnowing truth from possibility" crystallizes earned wisdom. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing—"thunder remained distant" reframes storms as enduring understanding. Avoids thematic echo; insights arise from Kaspar's tactile work, not abstraction. The CR closure makes conceptual cost undeniable through chess metaphors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Kaspar's perceptual signature is distinct: a tutor's precision in "arranging copper by touch" and chess-centric noticing ("sacrificing a queen to save a pawn"). Rhythm accelerates during high-pressure decoding ("fingers worked faster") then breathes at closure. No head-hopping; compression ("Three years had passed...") teaches the pattern early. Lexicon stays within his expertise, avoiding academic drift even at peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences like "lightning painted permanent veins" achieve high density without muddle. Minor overwriting in "fierce repose of this temporal prison" slightly dilutes momentum but doesn't obscure closure. Strategic telling compresses backstory efficiently. Final line ("some moments of understanding come only in the spaces...") recharges motifs with crystalline clarity. A hairline slip prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms redemption tropes through specific synthesis: chess strategy meets textile metaphors in "woven hush," avoiding generic time-frozen gimmicks. Emotional truth shines in Kaspar's flawed teaching ("wrong defense against Sicilian Dragon"), not abstract guilt. Risk-taking heightens stakes—lyric structure risks obscurity but closure lands through tactile precision. Freshness in "copper offering" symbolizing humble atonement.</comment>
