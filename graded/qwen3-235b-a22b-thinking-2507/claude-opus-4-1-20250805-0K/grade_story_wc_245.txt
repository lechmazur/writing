<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied language absorption ("Portuguese flooded through skin like warm honey"), but the epiphany lacks sufficient contradictory impulses in the climax—Elara's acceptance of blindness as gift feels resolved without visible struggle against lingering doubt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("her blindness was her gift"), and Accumulative lens holds perfectly through sonic density. One distinct issue: stillpoint's abstract nature slightly muddies the felt cost, triggering −0.8 Non-closure Accumulation Cap from 9.7.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest functions as active micro-setting—trees' linguistic frequencies constrain navigation choices, and the compass ring's final stillness charges the closure image. Sensory specificity ("soil's whispered directions") meets 9+ gate requirement flawlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through language accumulation narrowing Elara's path, but the dominant emotional-navigation goal remains slightly abstract; cost ("blindness was her gift") is conceptual yet legible. Agency-driven deepening qualifies for 8.8+ band despite minor stake vagueness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—"emotional frequencies" unlocking feeling chambers—not moralizing. Final image ("carrying the stillpoint within her") offers resonant answer to "uncharted depths" without stating morals, avoiding thematic echo traps.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bare feet reading soil's whispered directions") and rhythmic control ("Mandarin from oak, Swahili from birch") under pressure. Purposeful elision of sight knowledge taught early and paid off in closure; zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>One paraphrase loop in reflection ("understood why blind—sight would distract") slightly dulls momentum. No figurative muddle in peak beats, but scaffold prevents 9.0; artifacts avoid closure beat so cap at 8.8 per band rules.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synthesis of synesthesia and emotional cartography feels inevitable—transforming "mapmaker" into grief navigator through specific sonic mechanics. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry, meeting 9+ quick test with fresh inflection.</comment>
