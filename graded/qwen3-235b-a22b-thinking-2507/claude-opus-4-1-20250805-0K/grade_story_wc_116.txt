<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("gripped reality loosely") and embodied emotion through tactile rituals (folding swan, tracing air) earn the keeper's transformation. No second character limits relationship depth, but micro-choices like refusing speech for ecological integrity reveal consistent flaws under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: "luminous phrases growing like mushrooms" deepens pressure by transforming documentation itself. Closure as Charged Poise ("she had become what she documented") crystallizes the cost—her dissolution into ecosystem—with undeniable conceptual weight on the final line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Overgrown library constrains choice (explorers disrupt ecology) and charges closure: books becoming "moss became memory" directly fuels the final image of "not a keeper but a garden." Phosphorescent moss and river sediment are purpose-driven, not decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (witnessing without judgment) tighten when ephemeral mushroom-phrases demand new documentation methods. Agency lies in her "deliberate softening of certainty," but the cost remains conceptual (loss of self) rather than viscerally felt in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete metamorphosis: "facts decomposed into dreams" avoids moralizing. Final image ("folding and unfolding like an origami swan") reweights "regenerative silence" as active participation, though "endings are beginnings" edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "vines claimed shelves" reflects keeper’s worldview. Rhythmic control shifts from flowing cadences ("seasons drifted overhead like clouds") to fragmented intensity during mushroom-phrase discovery, teaching pattern early for payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; "paper swan so often folded... creases worn soft as silk" demonstrates high density. Minor register drift in "regenerative silence" (academic term) barely touches climax but avoids muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms archive tropes through embodied decay ("books became mulch became moss"). Fresh inflection: origami as dynamic map of "choices unmade" rather than static symbol. Avoids abstraction via tactile details like "weight evaporate" from mushroom-phrases.</comment>
