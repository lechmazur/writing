<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (seeking vs giving love) manifest in embodied choices like breathing shifts; final renunciation earned through past-life memory and vial's purposeful placement. Slight abstraction in "unused love" concept avoids diagnostic label-speak through concrete photo-release action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("empty and full simultaneously") reconfigures stakes with undeniable cost; accumulative lens holds through sensory layering. Orientation anchors viaduct/camera by line 15; cost proof in final paradox crystallizes the giving/receiving shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Camera obscura functions as micro-setting constraining choice (breathing alters viewfinder) and charging final image ("truly seeing"); wisteria's twilight bloom supplies the magical resource enabling door manifestation. Environment directly shapes climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: breathing pattern application narrows options to reveal door, with cost legible in her paradoxical emptiness/fullness. Single escalation (tear application → door appearance) suffices for accumulative lens under this scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (photos as offerings, tear as catalyst) avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "unused love" as active healing source. Non-literal answer in "sparks trailing footsteps" charges prior material without stating moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct ("camera's inverted world," "sparks like silk scarves"); rhythmic compression under pressure ("shallow, then deep, then holding") taught early and paid off. Zero head-hopping; elision of past-life memory serves closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "reality peeled back like old paint" demonstrates precise figurative language in peak beat. Final line recharges "sparks" motif with propulsion ("carrying the secret"), avoiding closure muddle. Text-artifact free.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms magical realism through camera obscura mechanics and breathing ritual; emotional specificity in "untold affections joining collection" avoids cliché. Risk-taking with accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
