<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in withheld breath/fingers dancing; ghost-memories ground motivation. Secondary musicians lack distinct micro-choices, slightly weakening collective agency under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: dewdrops carrying prophecy syllables make conceptual cost visceral. Vested hush crystallizes stance with undeniable weight. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds flawlessly through density escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dewdrops actively constrain tactics—each falling syllable alters the prophecy’s state. Bioluminescent moss pulses with the ritual, charging the final image. Prism atrium’s physical rules define the entire conflict’s mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pressure tightens through accumulating silence density, not plot turns. Cost is unmistakable: "ghost-memories" of unplayed futures and "permanent silence" reconfigure stakes. Marcus’s whispered instruction drives the decisive deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: negative space as resistance. Final rainbows reweight "permanent silence" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by making cost embodied in dewdrops and unplayed jazz.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dewdrops formed on brass instrument catching pale light") sustains rhythmic control. Minor register drift with "vested hush" slightly jars but fits lyrical mode. No head-hopping; compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dewdrops grew heavy and fell, each one carrying away a syllable" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Only microscopic flaw: "quietly vivid" slightly redundant but redeemed by moss’s active pulse.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "silence as weapon" through jazz-specific negative space. "Eerie nostalgia for futures never born" synthesizes trope into fresh emotional truth. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring the resonant closure.</comment>
