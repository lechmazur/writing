<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Marcus’s compass-flask pocketing and pole-counting ritual; Sarah’s "merrily melancholic" trait manifests physically in her shoulder touch. Avoids epiphany clichés but "backlash of regrets" borders on label-speak at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "learning to swim in shallower water" reconfigures grief with felt cost (lost career, 27 souls). Accumulative lens holds through fog lift/seal encounter, but pole-counting system slightly over-explains stakes pre-climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Utility poles function as micro-setting that constrains every choice (e.g., pole 31 = safe return limit) and charges final image. Fog/seal details narrow perception under pressure; compass’s physical weight embodies emotional burden without symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigating grief) tightens through Marcus’s pole-counting ritual deepening into teaching decision. Cost is legible via six-month sobriety and "learning to swim" metaphor, though "backlash of regrets" concept lacks tactical pressure in middle beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges through utility poles’ evolution from crutches to teaching tools; avoids moralizing by having Marcus declare "broken things can still point toward something meaningful" as earned realization, not abstract thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Marcus notices only navigational cues (current shifts at pole 17), not scenic beauty. Rhythm modulates perfectly from clipped "Simple. Practical." to flowing climax. Sarah’s dialogue carries subtext through merriment/grief tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; "rusty but genuine" laugh and "whiskered face" seal show textural specificity. Figurative language sparse but potent ("memory a wave eroding confidence"). Final line’s "shallower water" metaphor avoids overwriting while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms shipwreck trope through utility poles as unconventional constellation. Fresh inflection in teaching decision arising from seal encounter—not convenient epiphany. Avoids safety middle by keeping Marcus flawed (still pockets compass despite growth).</comment>
