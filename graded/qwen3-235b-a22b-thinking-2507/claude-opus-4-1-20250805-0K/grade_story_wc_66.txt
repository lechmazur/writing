<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses manifest in micro-choices: pen halting mid-note then weaving rebel lyrics, mixing dust with ink as embodied resistance. Final endurance (stepping into mist) forecloses safety with felt cost—her luminous burden risks capture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: the radio's persistent glow and dust's awakening reconfigure storytelling’s impossibility into imminent possibility. Lens ambiguity mid-story (causal to textural shift) prevents 9.0 despite flawless cost legibility at "the dust would remember."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ember alcove constrains choice by providing warmth for transcription, but "sustained her" phrasing lacks tactical pressure. Dust-as-setting charges the final image through "narrative spores," though alcove’s role remains atmospheric rather than causally decisive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single escalation when broadcast reveals it’s "meant specifically for Mariel," narrowing options to immediate transcription. Cost is legible in "luminous burden" and thistled calm, but dominant stake (dust awakening) lacks visceral tightening beyond lyrical instructions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Final image ("dust would remember") resonates non-literally with the central question, avoiding moralizing. However, "the world would learn to tell stories again" flirts with thematic echo, narrowly escaping penalty through Mariel’s embodied hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "amber light painted her fingers," "static dissolved into melody." Rhythmic control under pressure ("adjusting the dial with practiced delicacy") avoids uniformity. No head-hopping; voice modulates from tension to serene purpose.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Impossible to truly extinguish" in the penultimate paragraph risks thematic echo, dulling closure’s charge. Otherwise flawless propulsion: "breathed warmth," "dust remembers how to rhyme" weave atmosphere into action without scaffold. Final-line phrasing caps score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dust-as-story-carrier transforms dystopian tropes through specific mechanics (ink mixing, spores). Emotional truth in "thistled calm" avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (music as covert weapon) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable by dawn’s approach.</comment>
