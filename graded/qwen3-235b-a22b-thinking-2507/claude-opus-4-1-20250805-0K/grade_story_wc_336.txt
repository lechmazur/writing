<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in concrete action (pruning shears as needle), but "mending a wound in the world's capacity for wonder" edges toward abstract diagnosis without sufficient embodied contradiction in the climax beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the sprouting tree crystallizes options with visible cost ("life's greatest work complete"), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density escalation in possibility-droplets without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The waterfall's mist functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice (thread for weaving) and charges closure ("roots drinking from the waterfall"), with sensory hierarchy perfectly filtered through Mira's liminal perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative density (mist droplets accumulating unnamed color) narrows options to the precise planting moment, with visceral cost legible in "the waterfall seemed to pause mid-cascade" during the sprouting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (capturing color in soil), not abstraction; the final image reweights "puddles after rain" into enduring magic without moralizing, achieving Conceptual Repricing through the tree's dual shoots.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("see the shimmer where one reality bled") with rhythmic control in high-pressure beats ("Her pruning shears... became her needle"), though minor register drift in "insatiably creative mind" slightly disrupts voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via syntactic variation ("She stepped back... knowing she had captured") and textural specificity ("color that made the heart ache with recognition"), with no figurative muddle in the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specific synthesis (pruning as world-weaving), with emotional truth in "color children saw in puddles" avoiding abstraction; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
