<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Thessaly's internal conflict as paralyzed judge/executioner is embodied through telepathic "incisively kind" voice and micro-choices like Marina's ampoule-handling. No diagnostic label-speak; trembling hands and "purple, like poison" crystallize moral complexity with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "weight of her secret had been creating structural weakness" legibly charges cost in final image. Accumulative lens holds—memories escalate pressure like "dominoes falling upward" with coherent cause/effect. Minor dolphin-breach convenience doesn't undermine agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Underwater garden functions as micro-setting that charges closure: "collapsed wall" threading alters tactics, while "kelp forests thread through marble archways" evolves into "monument to complexity." Ampoule's "captured sunset" residue constrains the thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Marina's agency—her "*Show me*" thought initiates memories, "*terrible choices*" rejection crystallizes stance. Cost is visceral: trembling hands, shattered academic identity. Band guardrail met; "structural weakness" metaphor makes conceptual cost undeniable in final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete particulars: ampoule's purple residue becomes "red necessity and blue grief." Final image reweights garden as "monument to complexity" without moralizing. Avoids false balance—Thessaly's act is "monstrous and merciful," not symmetrically heroic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signatures: Thessaly's telepathic "incisively kind" voice vs. Marina's embodied regulator bubbles. Rhythmic control shines in memory sequences ("dominoes falling upward through time"). Zero head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during high-pressure revelations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "foxglove residue shift like captured sunset" does triple duty (object/theme/image). Figurative language sparse but potent—"structural weakness" metaphor avoids muddle. Final line "stone could be animate with possibility" achieves lyric precision without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "drowned city" trope via Thessaly's agency: garden keeper as intentional executioner. Fresh synthesis in "purple" moral calculus grounded in foxglove botany. Risk-taking (quiet closure) heightens stakes—statue's immobility makes "animate with possibility" resonate deeper.</comment>
