<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (stubborn duty vs. despair) drives micro-choices like prism alignment; embodied emotion in "pressed her palm" and "tears" avoids labels. Slight abstraction in "hope drifted" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "seventeen years of tending a dead beacon" crystallizes the sacrifice. Causal lens holds from shard discovery to beacon activation without telegraphed resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glass pavilion constrains choice by requiring harmonic detection of the shard; prism's fracture lines directly enable the climax. Micro-setting charges the final image with "shadows that fell upward."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mira's agency: aligning the prism to displaced stars reweights cosmic knowledge. Cost ("seventeen years") is legible but slightly abstracted; would gain 9.0 with more visceral forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "coincidences were conspiracies of light" crystallizes in the beacon's anti-light pulse. Final image ("thistle seeds on stellar wind") answers the central question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "cradled the broken crystal prism" and harmonic awareness. Minor register drift in "retrocognitive blessing" slightly dilutes voice under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; "silence spread like honey" metaphor sustains physical logic. Propulsion accelerates during prism healing with varied syntax ("creating shadows that fell upward").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Shard of hush" transforms beacon tropes through sonic physics. Emotional specificity in Mira's "stubborn refusal" avoids generic hope, but collapse premise lacks fresh angle for 9.0.</comment>
