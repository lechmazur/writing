<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through Mara’s tactile translation of grief into repair; Mrs. Huang’s trembling hands and dissolved sentence embody loss without therapy-speak. Final screw adjustment earns endurance via prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: the deliberately loose screw creates "time that acknowledged interruption" with visible cost in Mrs. Huang’s "You’ve given her back to me differently." Accumulative lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The birthing clamp screw constrains every choice—from discovery to modified reinstallation—and charges the final image where fog meets water like ultrasound. Micro-setting elevates to 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mara’s agency: tracing mineral deposits to diagnosing the screw’s meaning narrows options to one resonant choice. Cost crystallizes in the screw’s intentional looseness altering time’s flow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>"Time that acknowledged interruption" reweights the central question through concrete action, avoiding moralizing. Nearly loses points for "unveiled ordinary miracles" but saved by preceding sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: Mara’s touch-based noticing ("water carved new channels") modulates rhythm under pressure. Fogged glass motif taught early pays off in final ultrasound imagery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "mineral deposits mapped emotional terrain" exemplifies high-density propulsion. One borderline thematic phrase ("unveiled ordinary miracles") prevents 9.0 but doesn’t dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes water clocks and grief into non-obvious emotional cartography. Risk-taking in making repair a metaphor for integration—without abstraction—feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
