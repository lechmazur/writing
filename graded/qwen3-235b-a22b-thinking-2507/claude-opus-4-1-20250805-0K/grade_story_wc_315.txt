<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (corporate duty vs. ecological truth) drive Maya's pivotal lie about the six-month timeline; embodied emotion via the parachute buckle's worn metal shows character-specific stress response. Micro-choice to revise her report reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost in tightened grip on the buckle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "her burden had become her purpose" crystallizes stance with felt cost (the strategic lie about adaptation time). Accumulative lens holds through pattern recognition culminating in the encrypted drives' handoff; orientation clear by 50 words with "nocturnal arbor" and "midnight pattern seeker" anchors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor actively constrains choices: fungal networks inform Maya's decision to withhold data, while the hollow where she caches drives becomes pivotal. Bioluminescent moss and "soundless echo" aren't backdrop—they pressure her transmission tactics and charge the final image of her vigil.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Maya's agency: her realization about aerial carbon sinks forces the six-month lie, narrowing options to either trust the voice or preserve corporate cover. Cost is legible in "hand tightening on the parachute buckle" during the high-pressure transmission, altering her tactical vulnerability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "aerial carbon sinks" and fungal networks avoid moralizing, while the final image ("guardian of secrets the sky itself had whispered") reweights preservation as transcendent duty. No thematic echo—the truth about planetary survival is dramatized through her withheld data and strategic lie.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Maya notices chemical signals and growth rings, not just visual beauty. Rhythmic control under pressure shifts from technical ("optimize the signal") to lyrical ("soundless echo of its heights"), with purposeful compression in the radio exchange teaching its pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor synonym loop: "attentively inventive" echoes "constructing new instruments" without added pressure. Figurative language remains precise in peak beats ("silence stretched like a held breath"), but "muscle memory" repetition in close proximity slightly dulls immediacy during the hiding spot reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms eco-guardian trope through specific scientific texture (phosphorescent beetles, fungal networks) and the sky-forest's unique mechanics. Risk-taking heightens stakes: making climate adaptation visceral via "aerial roots" and carbon sinks avoids abstraction while maintaining emotional specificity in Maya's vigil.</comment>
