<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (truth vs mercy) drive Mara’s codicil decision with embodied cost—walnut-stained fingers closing around the locket after Eleanor departs. Near-flawless interiority avoids epiphanies; only "haunted euphoria" edges toward label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: Mara’s burden crystallized in the locket’s weight against her palm. Accumulative lens holds—pressure tightens via layered revelations about the fire, narrowing options to the codicil’s microscopic truth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Jetty’s wisteria constrains choices (codicil added at twilight) and charges the final image—petals releasing perfume as darkness settles. Walnut ink functions as micro-setting, staining Mara’s fingers to embody her moral burden in the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mara’s agency: discovering Thomas’s arson deepens the covenant’s weight, forcing the codicil choice. Cost is unmistakable—her "burden" of remembering, physically anchored in the locket’s press against her ribs at the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the locket photo’s reprise and codicil’s microscopic script reject forgetting. Final line reweights "gentle thoroughness" without moralizing—resonant ambiguity lingers in "haunted euphoria" of imperfect preservation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Archivist’s perceptual signature shines—"steeping" research like tea, noticing ink watermarks. Rhythmic control under pressure: fragmented sentences during codicil writing mirror her urgency, avoiding ventriloquism in Eleanor’s sparse dialogue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; "sheets of gold" slightly clichéd but redeemed by context. High density: "papery hands trembling" compresses age and emotion. Minor register drift in "proximate causes" risks academic tone but fits her profession.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms archival tropes through specific moral calculus—the codicil as quiet rebellion. Fresh synthesis: "weight of small moments" grounds universality in walnut ink stains and a locket photo. Risk-taking (truth/misery duality) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
