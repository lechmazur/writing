<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines in Kira’s reed-weaving micro-choices under pressure, but secondary characters lack contradictory impulses; Tomás’ warning reads as thematic mouthpiece rather than embodied flaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost (the exiled artist’s tears), and Accumulative lens holds through tag-pattern escalation; persistent constraint of obsidian’s fragility shapes final weaving tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Crystalline orchard actively constrains choices: moonlight guides tag-hunt, reeds’ pliancy versus obsidian’s rigidity charges the final image; micro-setting (water infused with crystal fruit) embodies cultural stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing community essence) tightens through protagonist-driven search ritual, but escalation lacks felt cost until climax; Tomás’ warning introduces stakes without narrowing Kira’s immediate options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from reed-obsidian tension; final image of "arbor as mirror" reweights "webs of kinship" without moralizing, avoiding the fatal final-paragraph thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("translucent fruit catching fire") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control in search ritual ("grandmothers leaning on teenagers") avoids lyric overload while teaching pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "luminescent ache of belonging" risks purple prose but earns weight through prior reed/obsidian texture; final line’s cadence shift ("dark beauty... golden promise") crystallizes closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "lost language" trope via seven dialects and obsidian tags; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes, but "boldly sympathetic" trait edges toward safety without deeper flaw exploration.</comment>
