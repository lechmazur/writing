<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "curse vs compass" realization, but final epiphany edges toward thematic echo ("become home for others") without sufficient struggle during sketching climax. Embodied emotion strong except in resolution's slightly tidy emotional calibration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: crew "temporally stretched but no longer lost" crystallizes stakes. Accumulative lens holds through density build, though cost legibility slightly softens in final image where stretching becomes purposeful movement without visible sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Gilded compass rose constrains choice (only she can touch it) and charges final image as "heartbeat," while rice paper's texture directly enables the solution. Micro-setting mastery elevates beyond atmospheric description into causal necessity for the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when Kira shifts from sketching vanished stars to mapping the station's future, but the resolution transforms temporal stretching into purpose without clear forfeiture. Agency drives escalation yet the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt in the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through rice paper's evolving meaning—from ancestral ritual to navigation tool—with final image (compass rose as heartbeat) offering non-literal answer to "true north." Zero thematic echo; complexity lives in "blessed pariah" duality without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("taffy across hours," "starlight remembered in gold") persists under pressure. Minor deduction for "confusion could become exploration" bordering on thesis-statement in high-stakes moment, though voice otherwise modulates perfectly with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "swimmers through honey" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Slight deduction for "echoed silence deepened as she worked" containing mild redundancy in pressure moment, though rhythm variation and concrete specificity otherwise flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms time-dilation trope through generational ritual (rice paper astronomy), with emotional specificity in "taffy" stretching metaphor. Risk-taking in quiet Charged Poise closure heightens stakes, though "true north" concept slightly familiar despite brilliant recontextualization.</comment>
