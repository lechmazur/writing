<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Micro-choices under pressure (valve manipulation, fragment arrangement) reveal hierarchy of values, but "absence has its own grammar" crosses into diagnostic label-speak during peak tension, slightly undermining embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise through the valve's final sigh—reconfiguring presence/absence duality with undeniable conceptual cost—while the Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly through staggered intervals and fragment accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rain-washed harbor functions as micro-setting: droplets refracting light directly constrain Kessa's archival work (revealing hidden inks), charging the final image where "sun fracture through droplets" crystallizes the story's core duality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Kessa's agency—turning the valve manually to create "whispered percussion" reweights the dominant stake (meaning from fragments) with visible conceptual cost, narrowing options toward Earned Stasis without causal shortcuts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through concrete particulars (tide charts beside wedding announcements), but "topology of loss" edges toward abstraction; the final valve sigh delivers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("salt crystals clung... like memories") shines, though "reactively visionary" disrupts voice consistency; rhythmic control excels in closure beat where mechanical sigh modulates emotional weight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density falters in mid-beat: "This rhythm wasn't planned but reactively visionary" exhibits template cadence and label-speak, slightly dulling momentum; otherwise propulsion and specificity (e.g., "ghostly telegraph of almost-music") are exemplary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms exile narrative through ocean-spray archivist specificity and valve-as-breath motif; emotional truth in "sum of presence and absence" feels inevitable, with risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
