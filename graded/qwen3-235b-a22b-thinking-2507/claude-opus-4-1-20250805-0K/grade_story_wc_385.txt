<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Senna's embodied dilemma ("sorrow, not joy" about transformation), but "richly perceptive" trait leans tell over show; micro-choice pressing shell to ear reveals values, though knowledge leap about echoes feels slightly unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "sang herself into the echo" crystallizes stance with undeniable cost ("leaving everything behind"), under Accumulative/Textural lens where patterned revelation narrows options; orientation anchors canyon/stars by line 5.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Canyon walls function as active setting—constraining choice (absorbing vs. echoing voices) and charging final image (becoming "instruments"); starlight/scales motif evolves causally to reveal dimensional shift at climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>Stakes escalate through shell's progressive disclosure narrowing Senna's options, but "universe needs translators" explanation slightly eases tension; cost legible in "leaving everything behind" foreclosing human existence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "echoes aren't repetitions but conversations" reweights premise via final image of melancholy whisper; avoids moralizing despite conceptual depth, though "translators" line skirts thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bones ache with recognition," "serpentine nexus") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control in shell revelation scene; lyrical compression taught early via sediment/voice layering pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("hundreds of voices layered like sediment") propels momentum, but "serpentine nexus" slightly drifts into elevated diction; final image’s "faintest whisper" avoids closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic physics/spiritual transformation feels inevitable; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry ("echo singers weren't missing; they had become something else").</comment>
