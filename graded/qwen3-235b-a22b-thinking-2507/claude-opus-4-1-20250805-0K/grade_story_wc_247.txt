<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in embodied contradiction: Maya's "fluid" signing despite arthritis and ritualistic camera clicks reveal her tension between memory and loss. "Apologetic" signing gestures risk label-speak but gain specificity through physical detail.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise via "silence felt like a beginning," with undeniable cost in "forty years" of erasure. Hybrid lens (Accumulative dominant at closure) holds as harbor's evolving light reweights stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Harbor functions as micro-setting constraint: moonlight enables sign-language translation, while "footprints and echo of gestures" charges the final image. Tidal rhythms directly shape Maya's mapping methodology and climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through deepening when Chen identifies the map as "a symphony in negative space," narrowing Maya's path from solitary ritual to shared creation. Cost is legible in "forty years" of forgetting crystallized at dawn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the final "echo of gestures that sang without sound" reweights silence as generative without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite "joyful sorrow" label via embodied tears and shared footprints.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in visual synesthesia ("framing silence," "frequency only she could hear"). Rhythmic control peaks in dawn sequence where short phrases mirror their collaborative urgency without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; "spilled mercury" harbor image gains specificity through tidal mechanics. Final line's "footprints and echo" avoids cliché by charging closure with tactile/auditory paradox essential to the premise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "deaf composer" trope via camera-as-instrument innovation. Risk-taking heightens stakes: mapping silence through shutter clicks creates irreplaceable logic where removing the camera would collapse the closure's visual symphony.</comment>
