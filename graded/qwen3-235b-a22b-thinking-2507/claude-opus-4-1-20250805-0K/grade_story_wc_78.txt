<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "curse was also salvation" but lacks visible flaw compounding choices; "restless euphony" feels earned yet micro-choices lack embodied tradeoffs during peak pressure (e.g., no physical cost during frantic strikes).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (mallet as "second heart"), but cost proof falters: "muscles aching" is generic, not irreversible change; the "new coordinates" reveal leans coincidental, weakening Accumulative lens cohesion at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Driftwood platform as micro-setting constrains every choice—from node-striking to whale-song resonance—and charges the final image ("orchard sailed on"); "blue hour" anchors time while salt-kissed branches and humming wood create visceral specificity without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via textural density (cloud-script → sketched resonances → visible light), but resolution hinges on external "string snapping" rather than Kessa's agency; whales' arrival feels fortuitous, not earned by her choices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "obstacles into instruments" motif, culminating in the mallet's pulse as freedom's heartbeat; avoids moralizing by showing transformation via concrete action ("every obstacle... unplayed instrument") rather than abstract declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "cumulus formations traced underwater currents" and "sussurus dubbed over base tones"; rhythmic control peaks with "movements a blur in the twilight," compressing time while maintaining visceral clarity under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("layering sound upon sound" after "building upon themselves") and "blue hour deepened"/"twilight" redundancy; no closure-dulling artifacts, but near-miss on 9.0 due to slight scaffold in sensory transitions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fractal math and sonic resonance transforms nautical tropes; "sketched resonances" reconfigures "impossible prison" into actionable hope without gimmickry, while "restless euphony" deepens theme through character-specific urgency.</comment>
