<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (ephemeral vs essential) manifest in embodied micro-choices like knotting with "demure audacity"; final renunciation of recognition earned through pattern recognition in the net's geometry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "ephemeral and essential as fireflies' light" crystallizes the cost of anonymity with undeniable conceptual weight under Accumulative/Textural lens, though "scintillatingly somber" slightly disrupts climax rhythm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (bamboo whisk, parapet stones) constrains choices: the whisk fractures moonlight to reveal patterns, while worn stones transmit historical vigilance directly shaping her philosophy and final action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist's observational agency: initial abstract curiosity tightens into visceral cost when firefly's glow embodies "joy remembered through sorrow," reweighting beauty's fragility against her mending labor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete particulars: net knots → firefly paths → moon reflections build to non-literal answer ("anonymous acts of care held the world together") without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: professional focus on angles/knots shapes "geometric repetition" observations; rhythm modulates from lyrical ("rain-scent lifted from stones") to urgent ("Her needle paused mid-stitch") under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; every sentence multiplies meaning ("splayed tines" refracting moonlight). Minor register drift in "scintillatingly somber" redeemed by immediate embodied context of firefly's pulse.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "wise observer" trope through net-mender's occupational lens: connecting firefly biology to women's invisible labor creates fresh synthesis where "demure audacity" feels inevitable yet revelatory.</comment>
