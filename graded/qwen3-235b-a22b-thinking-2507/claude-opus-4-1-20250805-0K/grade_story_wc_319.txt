<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Guardian’s embodied homesickness ("hollow spaces in ribs") and contradictory impulses (defender vs. longing for home) drive her pivotal choice. Motivation shift from isolation to trust feels earned through scholar’s familial plea, though feral-to-human transition slightly underplays internal resistance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as guardian steps into light; the thawing garden and "taste of words" render cost tangible. Orientation anchors by para 2 ("frozen garden" establishes stakes), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density shift at Codex opening dissolving boundaries.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Frozen garden functions as micro-setting: its "endless winter" interiorized in her thoughts directly constrains her agency, then charges the final image when thawing signifies transformation. Recurring ice motif ("cracked cherub," "crystals in thoughts") evolves from prison to liberation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize when scholar arrives: "trapped like her" vs. "rescue" creates a single tightening that forecloses her solitary vigil. Escalation through Accumulative lens—pendant’s warmth and Codex’s light reweight options—feels organic, though the scholar’s sudden "you want to come" slightly accelerates agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of "making friends with uncertainty" emerges through concrete stakes: her "terrible uncertainty" as companion reframes into "luminous uncertainty" at closure. No moralizing; the thawing garden’s final image resonates as a non-literal answer to dimensional limbo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Guardian’s POV voice shifts from fragmented ("clicking growls") to coherent as feral nature softens, with syntactic compression ("Ice crystals formed in her thoughts") reflecting her state. Scholar’s dialogue carries distinct urgency ("controlled fear"), avoiding ventriloquism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "crunched like broken glass" and "light poured out—not ending at boundaries but dissolving them" showcase high-density propulsion. Minor cliché in "hollow spaces in ribs" slightly dilutes originality but doesn’t obscure closure’s clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synthesizes "feral guardian" trope with dimensional librarian angle: her "interiorizing exteriors" flaw transforms safety (waiting in frozen garden) into courage (stepping into light). Risk-taking in conceptual closure (thawing as earned stasis) feels inevitable through prior particulars.</comment>
