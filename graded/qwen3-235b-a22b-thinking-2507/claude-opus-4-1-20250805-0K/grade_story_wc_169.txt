<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("logical mind rebelled") and embodied emotion (tracing fractures, tide-tingle) drive micro-choices like lantern configurations. Final renunciation of "bringing her back" for completing the journey earns closure with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: needle settling on "infinity" crystallizes "hope as perpetual ascent" with grandmother's dispersal as felt cost. Accumulative lens holds through density of mathematical patterns paying off in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tide-polished grotto actively constrains choices (tide timing, spiral carvings mirroring equations) and charges the closure via rising lanterns casting new formulas. Gauge and lanterns function as micro-settings altering tactics through Fibonacci resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (connecting across timelines) tightens through escalating lantern configurations culminating in 49-light helix. Cost crystallizes in grandmother's dispersal into light—a conceptual price that reconfigures hope's meaning under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete math (H = (L × T²)/D) not abstraction; final image of grandmother "woven into mathematics of hope" resonates without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality by grounding transcendence in phosphorescent ink and tide mechanics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in mathematical noticing ("light bent through microscopic fractures," "Fibonacci spirals"). Voice modulates from clinical ("seventeen distinct timelines") to lyrical ("constellation of lights") without register drift under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences like "salt air met stone, boundaries grew thin enough to measure" do triple duty. "Serene upheaval" phrase avoids cliché through precise context ("reorganized like sand settling after wave's retreat").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms multiverse tropes via mathematical specificity (amplitude as possibility measurement). Emotional truth anchors novelty: hope equations feel inevitable through tide-polished grotto physics and phosphorescent ink mechanics.</comment>
