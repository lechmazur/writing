<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "taste possibility's sharp mint / despair's purple edge retreating" with embodied cost; final choice earned through echo-weaving micro-choices under pressure, though ghostly nature slightly blunts struggle stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("fractured timeline settling into something beautiful and strange") under Accumulative lens; temporal density escalates through echo-weaving with persistent constraint (ghostly form) shaping tactics to the final honey-copper-strawberry taste.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mystic orchard actively constrains choices (season-confused apple trees forcing timeline navigation) and charges final image ("apple trees that remembered everything"); synesthetic body-as-setting ("translucent fingers," "taste of cardamom") reconfigures closure without symbolic shouting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through echo-weaving that narrows options to timeline selection; cost legible in "fractured timeline settling" but agency slightly diluted by mystical mechanics—Isabella's materialization feels less earned by Cornelius' specific choices than the setting permits.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "apple trees remembering everything" reweighting "every ending might also be a beginning" without moralizing; avoids sentimentality via ghostly permanence ("their audience of echoes applauded from across a hundred years") charging the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("honey and copper on a tongue he no longer possessed") modulates under pressure with rhythmic control; synesthetic compression taught early ("sounds intertwined with present-night—cricket songs...") pays off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("echoes that didn't fade but instead folded backward") with clear propulsion through peak beats; figurative language ("tasted of cardamom and looked like spiraling gold") serves mechanics without muddling causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope through synesthetic time-weaving; "tarot coin in seventeen poses" creates fresh inflection where specificity ("spring blossoms beside autumn harvests") avoids abstraction, though mystical orchard leans slightly archetypal.</comment>
