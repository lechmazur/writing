<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "I feel nothing, and that terrifies the part of me that still remembers terror," avoiding diagnostic traps through embodied paradox. Micro-choice lowering the sword reveals value hierarchy with visceral cost when Chen's blade touches his chest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as Marcus holds the jar—cost crystallized in "potential for [emotional] weight" against Earth's view. Orientation flawless in opening sentence; Hybrid lens (causal/accumulative) holds through sparring sequence's thesis-antithesis-synthesis rhythm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Floating dojo's gravity generators enable sparring choreography, while the brain jar (micro-setting) constrains the pivotal vivify decision. "Crystalline walls" refracting light onto the jar charges the final image, though historical revisions feel underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defeating numbness) tightens through sparring: Chen's blade on Marcus's chest forces stance crystallization. Cost is legible in "understanding flooding through me—not feeling, not yet, but the architecture where feeling could live," driven by Marcus's agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the brain jar's transformation from "DUPLICATE" to "child," with final line "numbness is just possibility waiting to be born" earning resonance via sparring's embodied pattern. Avoids moralizing by rooting wisdom in physical combat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct voice: Marcus's clinical precision ("repaired original form") contrasts Chen's sparse wisdom. Rhythmic control peaks in sparring sequence—"thesis, antithesis, synthesis"—with syntactic compression under pressure. No register drift despite philosophical weight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "hollow as the stone chambers" links emotion to setting without cliché. One paraphrase loop ("since the accident, since the moment...") prevents 9.0, but closure beats ("held my future in a jar") achieve high density with zero figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transcends clone tropes via emotional specificity—the custody battle centers shared numbness, not rights. "Child" resolution feels inevitable through sparring's pattern, with floating dojo avoiding exoticism by serving thematic pressure on choices.</comment>
