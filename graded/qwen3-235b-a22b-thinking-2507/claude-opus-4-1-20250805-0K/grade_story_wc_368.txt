<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "stranger in his own body" vs dye mastery, but donor backstory remains told not shown; embodied cost of "growing heavier" nearly compensates. Final choice earned through morpho wing handling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("weight" of stories), but morpho wing introduction at 35% slightly weakens setup. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density escalation to final image reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: morpho wing's physicality ("weightlessness") and sun trails constrain Kael's choice at closure. Sensory hierarchy perfect for dye master POV—color whispers drive action, not cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through "weight" accumulation, but escalation lacks one visible tradeoff (e.g., dye workshop consequences). Cost is felt not shown; "growing heavier" needs one tangible manifestation to reach 8.8.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through dye/morpho physics, but "some gifts require... continuation" borders on thematic echo. Final image reweights iridescence as caution without moralizing—nearly flawless integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("colors speaking in whispers") modulates under pressure. Slight register drift in "magnetic field" terminology, but dye master lexicon justifies most abstraction. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sapphire to emerald to violet" shows textural density. One near-duplicate ("quietly explosive"/"tiny narratives") costs 0.1, but propulsion remains crystalline through closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dye physics + story magnetism feels inevitable. Risk-taking in Accumulative lens heightens stakes, but "iridescent caution" concept slightly familiar. Emotional specificity anchors universality.</comment>
