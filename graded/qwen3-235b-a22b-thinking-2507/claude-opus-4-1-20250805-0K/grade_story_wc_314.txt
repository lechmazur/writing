<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (logic vs. wonder) drive Vera's crystal decision; embodied cost in tucking the empty cloth makes renunciation visceral. "Secretly sentimental" trait slightly over-told but redeemed by immediate micro-choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: dissolving the crystal reconfigures "absence" as power with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds throughout—density builds via starling patterns to crystallize Vera's stance without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Orchard's spiral pears actively constrain choices by defying botany; "ancient freshness" evolves from sensory detail to thematic core. Final image ("timelessness and dawn") charges closure by merging setting with Vera's resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stakes (wonder vs. hollow logic) tighten through Vera's deepening realization via starlings' patterns. Agency is pure interiority—melting the crystal forecloses "capturing wonder" with irreversible cost (physical proof sacrificed).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: grandfather's singing copper sulfate, starlings' "cursive mathematics." Final "alchemy marriage" reweights prior material without moralizing—resonance from Vera's embodied choice, not abstract statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("water became light," "breathing geometry") filters all description. Rhythm modulates perfectly: lyrical cadence for wonder, clipped urgency for action. Zero head-hopping; compression taught early via waterfall intro.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops—sentences multitask ("vapor rose and mingled with orchard's freshness, starlings' patterns, waterfall's song"). "Secretly sentimental" label slightly risks therapy-speak but redeemed by immediate embodied action (tucking cloth).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms alchemy trope through physics-poetry fusion ("crystallize wonder," "sublime without liquid"). Emotional specificity in Vera's struggle avoids cliché; "ancient freshness" paradox feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
