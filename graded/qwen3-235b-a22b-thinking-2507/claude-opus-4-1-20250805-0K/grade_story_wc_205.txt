<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cassia's revolutionary past fuels authentic contradictions (prison-hardened yet fired by ghosts), but Huang lacks depth beyond plot function; his shift from rigid to curious feels slightly unearned despite gloves-adjusting micro-choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "sorrow remained, burnished bright... but no longer defined her" crystallizes the cost of reimagining defeat. Accumulative lens holds through intensifying temporal imagery, though Huang's pivot lacks full causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid actively constrains choices: covered mirrors enable Cassia's temporal theory, and the shard's refraction directly triggers the ghostly vision. Final "liquid history" image charges closure with tangible cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Cassia's demonstration—shifting dispute from ownership to ontological redefinition. Conceptual cost (redefining "defeat") is unmistakable in her realization, though Huang's pressure could deepen the tradeoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "sorrow became the lens" reweights defeat as preparation without moralizing. Recurring shard motif shifts from artifact to kindred spirit, offering resonant non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cassia's voice shines with character-specific texture ("tactical maps" for time streams, prison-poem cadence), but Huang's dialogue lacks distinct idiom; his curiosity shift feels narratively convenient rather than voice-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts—every line advances story or character (e.g., "cherubs weep actual gold" establishes time-distortion). Final "liquid history" line varies rhythm while charging closure with flawless density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: poetic revolutionary deciphers alien memory via crystal shards. Bold risk in making time visible as "amber light" directly enables the ghosts, transforming archaeological dispute into resurrection imperative.</comment>
