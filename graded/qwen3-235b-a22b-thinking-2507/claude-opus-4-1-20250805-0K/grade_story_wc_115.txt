<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Marcus recognizes the caller's silence as "truth they've been digesting for decades," embodying his Methodist skepticism while respecting decay's stories; embodied choice to photograph but not touch valve wheel crystallizes his moral stance under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: "left the valve wheel where it belonged, in the space between confession and absolution" reconfigures the dominant stake with felt cost ("weight... settling into his bones"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through radio fragments intensifying pressure toward crystallized stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The beaded valve wheel constrains Marcus's pivotal choice (to document not disturb), charging the final image where it "sat there, oxidized but intact"; sensory details like "sweating brick walls" and "metal tombstones" actively pressure his decisions rather than decorate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by radio confessions narrows Marcus's options toward the appraisement choice; "weight of swallowed truth" stake intensifies through caller fragments culminating in psychic's "confessions aren't meant to be absolved," making the cost legible in his final act of witness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image of valve wheel "in the space between confession and absolution" offers resonant non-literal answer to "swallowed truth" without moralizing; theme emerges through concrete particulars like prayer beads as "DNA strands," avoiding abstraction while embracing moral complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct in Marcus's occupational awareness ("practiced fingers adjusting frequency," "drowsy alertness"); rhythmic control under pressure evident in clipped radio fragments versus lyrical closure, with elision (caller cutoffs) taught early and paid off in thematic weight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "oxidized but intact, prayer beads still wound through its spokes like DNA strands" demonstrates high-density imagery without muddle; final line’s "metal dust, like prayer" achieves resonant specificity without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope through occupational specificity (beaded valve wheel as union artifact) and moral calculus; fresh synthesis of "ghost shift" as metaphor for collective guilt feels inevitable, with risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
