<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sarah's prosopagnosia manifests in concrete, character-specific observation ("mapping the world through texture"), and her contradictory impulse to seek truth through duality—not faces—drives the final deduction. No therapy-speak; embodied flaw (blackened fingers, trembling hand) directly fuels the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: portraits reweight the premise (masks hide duality, not identity) with conceptual cost (vanished evidence, killer's unresolved pursuit). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, but psychiatric deduction ("seventeen months ago") strains causality, lacking prior setup to motivate the specificity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The quarry’s mist and limestone actively constrain Sarah’s texture-based method, while the charcoal case (labeled by hardness) becomes a micro-setting that charges the final image—easels packed "each charcoal returning to its designated slot" crystallizing her earned control amid chaos.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Sarah’s accumulating portraits revealing duality, narrowing options to one deduction ("psychiatric hospitals"). Cost is felt in her trembling hand and vanished evidence, but the killer’s motivation ("seventeen months ago") lacks causal escalation; the pressure hinges on her insight alone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: "seventeen proofs that we are all divided selves" reweights fragmentation as universal, not pathology. No moralizing; the final image ("carrying seventeen proofs") resonates through concrete particulars (charcoal dust, ribbon fragment), avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sarah’s perceptual signature ("truth lived in the angles between shadow and bone") infuses every line, with rhythm shifting from measured strokes to urgent deductions. No head-hopping; voice modulates under pressure (e.g., "her hand trembled") without syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("generous hands emerging from clenched fists" does triple duty). "Light through prisms" metaphor risks cliché but is redeemed by her artist POV. Final line’s cadence ("divided selves seeking dangerous unity") avoids sentimentality through specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms the detective trope via prosopagnosia—truth emerges from texture, not faces. The "unified contradictions" premise feels inevitable through Sarah’s portraits, with emotional specificity (banker’s guilt, prosecutor’s rage) avoiding generic duality. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
