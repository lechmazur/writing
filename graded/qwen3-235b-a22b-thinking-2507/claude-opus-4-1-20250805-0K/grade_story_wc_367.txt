<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in mirror-twin confrontation; embodied "shadowed elation" avoids therapy-speak. Final choice earned by laughter-harmony micro-choice with conceptual cost. Slight emotional calibration in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "teaching reality itself how to navigate" reconfigures options. Accumulative lens holds—density peaks when wick reverses light inward. Orientation anchored by first sentence; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Emerald lens and glass wick constrain choices (laughter calibrated to wick geometry) and charge final image (stars rearranging). Micro-setting specificity: "bare feet knowing every worn groove" reflects urgency. No white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guiding ships) tightens meaningfully when mirror-twin ship forces collaboration. Cost crystallizes in "shadowed elation" as conceptual burden of expanded purpose. Agency clear—laughter harmonies reverse wick’s reflection under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "laughter as compass and engine" reweights navigation. Final image (stars spelling truths) offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—no character states thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("inhaling stardust, exhaling possibility") modulates under stress. Rhythmic control peaks in ship arrivals: short clauses for newspaper headlines, fluid cadence for dawn vessel. Zero head-hopping; lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; "crystalline structure designed to channel light" does triple duty. Figurative language precise even in climax ("laughter became a beacon"). Final line’s "universe steering itself" avoids overwriting while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: quantum physics ("total internal reflection") as navigation method transforms lighthouse myth. Emotional specificity in "swallowing storms instead of birthing them" avoids generic tropes. Risk-taking heightens stakes without muddying clarity.</comment>
