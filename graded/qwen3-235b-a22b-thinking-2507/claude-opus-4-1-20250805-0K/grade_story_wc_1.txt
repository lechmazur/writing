<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marina’s embodied contradiction—honoring poisoned legacy while rejecting its cost—drives her final choice to warn suppliers. The micro-choice to tuck ledger "against her heart" crystallizes value hierarchy with visceral cost: her assumed death.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with Marina walking toward new possibilities, but the conceptual cost of abandoning her identity lacks a concrete on-page image (e.g., burning her artist ID) to fully satisfy cost proof test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Frost patterns function as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: Marina’s realization that "transformation happens slowly" directly informs her decision to warn suppliers. Final ice crystals’ "harmless luminescence" charges the closure by reweighting the radioactive glow theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single tightening (destroy ledger vs. warn suppliers) is driven by Marina’s agency under Accumulative lens, but off-page arsonists weaken external pressure. Moral calculus sharpens the choice, though visible cost (her erased identity) feels slightly abstract versus physical sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image of "temporary and safe" frost luminescence answers the central question without moralizing. Radiation-to-ice transformation reweights "beauty born from poison" into earned wisdom through concrete particulars, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: glass artist notices "microscopic structures" in frost. Rhythmic control shifts from fragmented urgency ("Her father’s increasing fatigue") to lyrical resolution. Minor deduction for "steadily adjusting" slightly over-explaining an otherwise shown trait.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion. "Scorched testament to ambition’s true price" earns weight without muddling. Final line’s cadence ("enduring seeking light—would continue through her, transformed") crystallizes closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radioactive legacy with frost’s "harmless luminescence" avoids trope. Risk-taking in quiet resolution heightens stakes, but "poisoned legacy" framework feels familiar without deeper transformation of the inheritance trope.</comment>
