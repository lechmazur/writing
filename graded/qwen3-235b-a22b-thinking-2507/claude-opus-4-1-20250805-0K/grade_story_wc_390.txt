<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Embodied emotion shines (trembling hands, larynx adjusting), but contradictory impulses lack active tension during climax; ancestral memory informs but doesn't complicate her final choice under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly: sunset timing → Collector approach → ritual necessity → transformation. Cost is visceral (coat left behind), though "seventeen years" backstory lacks direct present-tactic linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina actively constrains choices (frozen door, cracking ice under boots), with azure coat charging the final image. "Honey and blood" sunset edges toward cliché but redeemed by functional pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes viscerally narrow (silenced lighthouses = shipwrecks) via one tightening (Collectors' arrival). Deduction because their threat, while urgent, lacks unique texture beyond generic antagonism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "song echoing through fog and time," avoiding moralizing. Slight deduction as "living agreement with the drift" risks abstraction without sufficient concrete grounding in the ritual.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("vibrations like whispered prayers"), rhythmic control under pressure flawless. Minor register drift in "sonic absolution" phrasing slightly distances from engineer POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-perfect propulsion; "bioluminescent patterns that matched no earthly creature" contains redundant "that," muddling a peak beat. Prevents 9+ per Text Artifact Screen.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse engineering and sonic physics feels inevitable. Deduction because Collectors as museum antagonists lack distinctive transformation beyond familiar trope.</comment>
