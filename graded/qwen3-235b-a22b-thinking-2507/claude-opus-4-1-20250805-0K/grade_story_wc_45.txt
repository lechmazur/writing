<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Thomas's micro-choices—repairing the nest, returning the tooth—reveal his transformed stance with embodied contradiction ("yearning for the sister he'd lost and learning to love the one he'd found"). No therapy-speak; flaws drive authentic endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: the tooth's return crystallizes irreversible change with visceral cost ("gap-toothed and giggling" memory vanishing). Orientation anchors in 38 words; Accumulative lens holds through density shifts in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The changeling tooth and secret garden actively constrain choices (Elara's appearance through hedges, nest repair using spider silk). Jasmine's off-season bloom charges the final image, reweighting "mistakes as stars" with tangible cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Elara questions his bone-setting: his "understanding why they broke apart" deepens the central conflict. Agency-driven escalation culminates in the tooth's return—a visible cost that forecloses permanence while enabling new connection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through bone-setting metaphor and garden imagery without moralizing. The final line ("children who were exactly what they seemed, even when they weren't") reweights the premise as earned wisdom, avoiding sentimentality through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Thomas's perceptual signature—light on the tooth, bone architecture, shifting violet eyes—creates distinct rhythm. Voice modulates under pressure: short syntax during the tooth exchange, lyrical flow in closure. Zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "pearlescent surface that caught light differently" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor overwriting in "shrewdly innocent precision" (Q7−0.1) but closure lines hum with propulsion. Final image recharges the tooth motif flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms changeling tropes through bone-setting healer lens. "Certainty is overrated" risks sentimentality but gains freshness via concrete garden logic. Emotional specificity—nostalgia woven into spider-silk repairs—avoids genericity.</comment>
