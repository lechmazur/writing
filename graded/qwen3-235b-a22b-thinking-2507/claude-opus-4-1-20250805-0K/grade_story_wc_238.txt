<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's embodied guilt ("words scraping throat raw") and micro-choice to collaborate show contradictory impulses; her flawed exorcism history drives irreversible stakes without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (empty bottle, "music remains") reconfigures options with conceptual cost—orchard destruction severs connection permanently; Accumulative lens holds via scent/music density intensification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perfume bottle constrains every choice: its scent enables collaboration, dictates urgency as trees fall, and charges the final image (empty vessel holding memory); orchard destruction provides tangible pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten relentlessly through falling trees (live clock narrowing time); Vera’s agency in choosing collaboration over exorcism forecloses her old worldview with visible cost—Elisabetta’s irreversible dissolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "apologies arrive as sheet music" reframes reconciliation without moralizing; final column metaphor ("ghosts finish work before leaving") reweights exorcism as invitation, not invasion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Vera’s journalistic precision ("parasitic spirit") clashes with poetic vulnerability ("memory itself, distilled"); perceptual signature filters scent/music through her columnist lens, modulating under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "words scraping throat raw" embodies regret with visceral specificity; final line’s compression ("written in a dead woman’s perfume") crystallizes theme without abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms exorcism trope via music/perfume mechanics; "gossip-column exorcist" specificity avoids cliché; risk-taking (lyric closure) heightens stakes while maintaining causal coherence.</comment>
