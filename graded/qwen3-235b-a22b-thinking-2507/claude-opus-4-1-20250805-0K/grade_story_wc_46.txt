<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in tactile memory (polishing motions) and embodied emotion (gasping at light), but lacks contradictory impulses during discovery moment; grandfather's death as backstory anchors motivation without mid-crisis self-deception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "grandfather died" backstory crystallizes into villagers learning the technique, reconfiguring guidance from solitary duty to communal practice; Accumulative lens holds through sensory density buildup to grotto's transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Serpentine grotto functions as micro-setting: mist becomes light canvas, acoustics transform laughter, amphitheater enables beacon—all directly constrain choices; "zephyr bloom" ornamental but "salt-slick steps" and sea glass density anchor sensory urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide ships through fog) tightens via grotto's physical properties; cost legible in grandfather's death backstory, but pressure lacks meaningful escalation—sea glass solution emerges without tactical struggle or narrowing options during the scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "light shared without flame" crystallizes in final image of villagers polishing glass, avoiding moralizing; "brightest lights glow softest" reweights premise with social cost (solitary duty → communal burden) without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (astronomer noticing light refraction in mist), rhythmic control via fragments ("Not with fire, but with captured light"); no head-hopping, consistent psychic distance even during memory surge triggered by sea glass.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "polishing" does triple duty (character history/plot device/theme); "memories resurfaced like breaching whales" slight metaphor drift in peak beat avoids figurative muddle through visceral immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse trope via sea glass solution; "earthbound star watcher" angle feels fresh through gem-polishing craft, though "pearl of stillness" concept borders on cliché until final image grounds it in communal action.</comment>
