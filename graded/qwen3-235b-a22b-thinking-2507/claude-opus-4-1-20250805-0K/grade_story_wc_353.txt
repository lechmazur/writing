<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Limited interior contradiction; Mira's flaw (impatience risk) is implied but not actively tested under pressure. Strength: embodied empathy guides micro-choices like "swaying to match ancient rhythms," making renunciation of force credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density intensifies through sonic layering to Charged Poise closure. Cost is legible in the insulator's "tiny fractures" and Mira's exhaustion. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Porcelain insulator (tool) constrains choices—only its electrical properties enable sound extraction—and charges closure via self-etching cracks. Sensory hierarchy flawless: Mira's "symphonically minded" bias filters bark stress into musical memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mira's agency: her "tenderness" method narrows options against failed hammering approaches. Cost is unmistakable in the insulator's sacrificed integrity ("surface now etched with tiny fractures") reweighting the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "silence broken through careful listening" crystallized in the grove's "ghost of birdsong." Final image ("music hung like morning mist") reweights the premise without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices "frozen sound waves" in bark, not visual flaws. Rhythmic control peaks during strumming ("coaxing out vibration too subtle") with compression serving pressure. Zero dialogue to contaminate voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "melody heartbreaking in its beauty" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Figurative language sparse and purposeful ("music hung like morning mist"). Closure beat ("hedgehog seemed to smile") radiates clarity without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic trope through specific sonic archaeology. Risk-taking: Accumulative structure hinges on non-visual sensory recovery. Emotional truth in "trees needed tenderness" feels earned, not quirky. Synthesis inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
