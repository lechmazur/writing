<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final choice earned through embodied contradiction: "voice cracked from disuse" then "words steady now" shows internal shift. Micro-choice of pocketing sea glass reveals hierarchy of values. Only Jonas's exposition slightly weakens motivation clarity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "tears falling like sea glass" crystallizes eternal solitude. Orientation clear by 70 words. Ghostly explanation risks convenience but earns weight through Elsa's physical transformation at lamp.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sea glass constrains final action and charges closure image. Lantern room "breathing" actively pressures choices. "Phosphorescent foam" slightly generic but "bottled safety" motif transforms setting into thematic engine.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (isolation→purpose) tightens through accumulated pressure: letters→cairns→ghosts. Cost visible as sea glass "grew warmer" during realization. Jonas's exposition slightly undercuts agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</comment><comment>Theme emerges through stone language reprise: "I am here. You are not alone" charges prior cairns. Avoids moralizing—tears "like sea glass" earns resonance. "Bottled safety" concept risks abstraction but saved by physical manifestation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "worn skiff through familiar rocks" embodies Elsa's history. Rhythmic control peaks at lamp relighting ("thought of all her supply runs..."). "Peculiar ache" slightly abstract but otherwise flawless pressure modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; "cracked from disuse" does triple duty. "Tears falling like sea glass" transforms potential sentimentality into crystalline image. One abstract phrase ("peculiar ache") prevents 9.7+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms haunted lighthouse trope through specific mechanics (stone language, intention-based lamp). Emotional truth in "standing alone in the light" avoids genre clichés. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
