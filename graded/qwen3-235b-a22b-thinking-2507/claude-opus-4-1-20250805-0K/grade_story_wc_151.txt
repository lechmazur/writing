<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "false name but a true one" crystallizes at closure, but contradictory impulses during naming lack sufficient friction; embodied micro-choices like chalk color selection elevate specificity without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("rain would wash it away"), but the felt cost isn't embodied in Mira's final action; Accumulative lens holds yet lacks density increase during pivotal naming moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Golden arcade functions as micro-setting constraint: security cameras enable chalk work, rain erasure charges final image; "colored dust on marble" tactically shapes the ritual's temporality and stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes remain static—no escalation from "three hours" timeframe or naming process; dominant stake (meaningful connection) isn't tested through narrowing options, only stated; pressure never tightens under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "seeds of an older, newer world" without moralizing; "margins between who they were and who they might become" avoids thematic echo by charging the final image with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "brass fixtures catching first light like memories," but abstraction ("finding truth in the space between") edges toward unearned insight; rhythm modulates perfectly during chalk ritual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, yet "weight of paper, anticipation of waiting" uses triplet abstraction where concrete detail would deepen; otherwise, high density with precise verbs ("scraped," "warming," "crystallized").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms analog nostalgia through pseudonym creator profession; "Sender Tilde Fossilheart" synthesis feels inevitable, but risk-taking stays within safe bounds—no bold structural disruption to heighten stakes.</comment>
