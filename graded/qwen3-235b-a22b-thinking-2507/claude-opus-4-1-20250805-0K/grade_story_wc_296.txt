<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Kael’s "warlike serenity" masking desperation; embodied emotion in "water streaming from his guarded expression" avoids labels. "Finds lost things" trait lacks sufficient on-page tradeoffs during search.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "shattered confession" becomes "liquid truth" as Kael walks toward judgment. Orientation flawless ("cursed lake," "three days passed" at 38 words); causal lens holds through seed’s pulse reconfiguring stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cursed lake’s vortex actively constrains choices (pulling Kael down) and charges final image as trees "straighten from their spiral." Glass garden’s "absences" reweights setting’s thematic role without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bloodline survival) tightens via Kael’s agency: shattering confession releases truth, forcing acceptance of dishonor. Cost legible in "guarded expression" and conceptual shift from execution threat to Blight’s silent war.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "dishonor be my gift" crystallizes sacrifice without moralizing. Final image ("truth, like water") reweights "frozen confession" as resonant answer to "finding corruption."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "apple blossoms bloomed and rotted simultaneously" reflects druidic worldview. Rhythmic control under pressure via sentence variation ("He moved in expanding circles...") with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "roots grew backward into sky that existed beneath water" compresses setting with causal precision. Final line’s metaphor ("truth, like water") avoids overwriting while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "cursed artifact" trope via seed’s hunger for corruption—a fresh moral calculus. Avoids safety middle with "dishonor as gift" synthesis, though "warlike serenity" slightly familiar.</comment>
