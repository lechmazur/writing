<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied contradiction shines in "wavering and unwavering" hands during uncorking; Kess’s presence as woven consciousness avoids stock grief tropes. Micro-choice of releasing the blank fortune as a moth earns the renunciation with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: sensory density builds toward Charged Poise closure where Mira’s altered state ("fundamentally altered") carries cost through Kess’s humming love. Orchards’ shifting petals could tighter pressure the transformation beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Everbloom Orchard’s permanent moon constrains choice—pearl-white blossoms never falling mirror Mira’s stasis before uncorking. Final image of moonlight "warmer now" charges closure through setting evolution, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (reforging bond beyond death) tightens relentlessly: spices’ cost ("spent everything") and transformation’s irreversible edge ("un-become") culminate in agency-driven uncorking. Cost is unmistakable in Mira’s "fundamentally altered" state.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Love changes frequency" avoids moralizing by emerging through Kess’s rustling leaves and moth transformation. Final image reweights cosmic intimacy without stating theme, offering resonant non-literal answer to "un-becoming" premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in animal-sense layering ("wolf’s eyes saw the moon as beacon"), but minor filter verbs ("she felt her edges blur") slightly dilute immediacy during peak transformation. Rhythmic control under pressure remains exceptional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "petals becoming scales, becoming feathers" shows textural propulsion. Slight register drift in "cosmic web" (feels slightly generic amid otherwise precise diction) prevents 9.0, though closure remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms phoenix tropes through "un-becoming" specificity—spices as cosmic doorways avoid cliché. Risk-taking (beast-as-tapestry consciousness) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable via prior sensory details.</comment>
