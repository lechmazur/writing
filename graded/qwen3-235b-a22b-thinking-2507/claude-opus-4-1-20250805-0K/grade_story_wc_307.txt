<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("withholding crucial detail" vs teaching through experience) and embodied emotion ("iron in her blood tugging") deepen stakes; Marcus's realization earned through sensory immersion, not exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with visceral cost in Marcus's "You're not really aging backwards" epiphany; Accumulative lens holds through patterned escalation to the final ring's perfection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Pond ripples constrain every choice and charge the final image; magnetic grotto's physical pull on blood makes setting a tactical constraint, satisfying 9+ gate with micro-setting mastery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through withheld revelation (tenth ring) forcing Marcus's cognitive shift; cost is irreversible worldview fracture made legible in "recognition" and dawn's temporal ambiguity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete particulars (rings containing all others); final line reweights "vanishing" without moralizing, avoiding Thematic Echo by embodying wisdom in the stone's last ring.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sycamore hush," "cells remembering tomorrow") modulates under trance pressure; no head-hopping, with psychic distance shifts serving the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "starlight bending" metaphor risks slight overwriting but earns payoff in closure's spirals; final line achieves crystalline propulsion without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms backwards-aging trope through magnetic physics and pond pedagogy; "vanishing to appear" synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh, with risk-taking heightening coherence via Charged Poise closure.</comment>
