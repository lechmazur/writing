<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s embodied frustration (“rust loved and precision hated”) and micro-choices (turning compass over, suspending it) reveal contradictory impulses—fixer vs. acceptor—but the climax lacks visible internal struggle during his pivotal shift to “befriending uncertainty,” slightly diluting the earned renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Marcus’s refusal to repair (“I help them find what they were meant to be broken”) crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (abandoning identity), under Accumulative/Textural lens where leaf-clock patterns reweight time’s meaning without causal resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Waterfall mist enables rust, powers compass rotation, and creates the greenhouse’s “perpetual autumn”—environment actively constrains choices (filing ruined by dampness) and charges the final image (compass spinning to waterfall’s song), satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Marcus’s agency: his improvisation (suspending compass) and greenhouse experiment narrow options toward renunciation, but the “breakthrough” moment feels slightly convenient, softening the escalation’s pressure despite conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (“pointing nowhere and everywhere” → “temporal map that made no logical sense yet felt absolutely true”), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights “broken” as purposeful without stating a thesis, though secondary stakes lack depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice radiates Marcus’s tactile precision (“filing, soldered, polished”) and selective perception (noticing leaf spirals, ignoring time), with rhythmic control in high-pressure beats (“ticking shifting into complex rhythms”); no POV slippage despite reflective fragments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere or arc (“dead leaves danced in impossible spirals” compresses setting/theme), but minor figurative density in greenhouse scene (“eight distinct streams”) slightly blurs immediacy without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Synthesizes “broken time” trope through specific mechanics (clocks offset by hours, compass as conductor), avoiding abstraction; emotional truth in Marcus’s shift from futility to purpose feels fresh, though risk-taking stays within safe conceptual bounds.</comment>
