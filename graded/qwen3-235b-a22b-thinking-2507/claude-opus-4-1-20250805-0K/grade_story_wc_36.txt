<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction manifests in trembling fingers yet deliberate unsealing; embodied failure in "avalanchingly quiet" mountains pressing eardrums. Final choice to weave earns closure through prior desperation-driven experimentation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes when the seed settles "warm behind her sternum"—conceptual cost of reframing failure as beginning is legible. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density shift during weaving sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The gilded reed flute constrains every choice: its visible "thread of gold" replaces sound, and securing it post-transformation charges the final image. Canyon hush actively swallows sound, making flute mechanics pivotal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation via deepening realization: "they'd treated worlds as enemies" crystallizes the stake shift from sealing to braiding. Cost is conceptual—family legacy's collapse made visceral in "her failure hadn't been in letting them touch."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through driftwood markers becoming a two-way message, not moralizing. Final line reweights guardianship as doorway transformation without stating morals—pure conceptual repricing earned by woven insights.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "heat waves in winter" contradiction; rhythm compresses under pressure ("Each note pulled a strand... each rest drew one"). Zero head-hopping despite Other Place figure's appearance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold—every phrase multiplies meaning ("silence deepening until it became a presence"). Final image's "benediction rather than judgment" recharges the opening's oppressive silence with flawless cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms portal fantasy via choreographer metaphor: driftwood markers evolve from safety beacons to cross-world communication. Risk-taking (silence as active presence) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
