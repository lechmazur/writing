<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion ("fingers trembled," "chest rising") and micro-choices (prodding soil, leaving basil), but lacks layered contradictory impulses during pivotal moments; the "wistfully pragmatic" motivation is clear yet slightly abstract in reflection beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves perfect Charged Poise as Marina accepts cycles of rest/renewal; cost is visceral in the released petal and wedged gauge tooth. Minor thematic echo ("reflecting light") slightly dilutes earned resonance but doesn't break the Accumulative lens holding through the luminous harbor image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The lockmaster's gauge tooth functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (measuring soil, instilling at dock) and charges the final image; harbor's moonlit transformation actively pressures Marina's decision to release the rosebush cycle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ending cycles to enable renewal) tightens through the petal drop and rowing rhythm, but escalation lacks meaningful pressure escalation under Accumulative lens; cost is unmistakable yet the harbor setting's role in narrowing options feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars (basil bundles, sunflower seeds), avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights "measuring what matters" without stating morals. "Reflecting light" phrasing risks abstraction but is redeemed by Mrs. Chen/Morrison kids examples.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("moonlight spilled like mercury," "luminous water") modulates with emotional intensity; rhythmic control mirrors oar strokes. Minor register drift in "wistfully pragmatic certainty" slightly breaks POV lexicon during peak reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion ("splash, pull, lift, return"). "Luminous harbor" repetition lacks deepening in final beat, and "quivering hush" cadence risks template rhythm without sufficient variation in high-pressure moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms gardening trope through lockmaster's heritage and harbor setting; gauge tooth's repurposing feels fresh. Rose-petal symbolism borders on familiar but gains specificity via fire escape constraints and brass tool integration.</comment>
