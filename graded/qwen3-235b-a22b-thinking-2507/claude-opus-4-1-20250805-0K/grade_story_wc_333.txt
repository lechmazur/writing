<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction weak during climax; "unassumingly bold" shown via action but lacks simultaneous fear/courage tension in pivotal lock-picking. Bleeding fingers reveal struggle yet no trade-off between safety and transformation is embodied in her choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: dawn's approach crystallizes reconfigured stakes with conceptual cost ("seed planted, door opened"). Accumulative lens holds through fear-web untangling, and "impossible shadow" physics break charges the final image without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Shadowed nexus constrains movement (blurring passages force disorientation acceptance) and the "shadow falling upward" charges closure. Missing tactile locksmith tools during pivotal action slightly undermines occupational specificity, though starlight's "impossible angles" brilliantly embodies thematic pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation via density increase works: disorientation transforms into fear-web vibration that narrows options. But stakes remain abstract—liberating an idea lacks visceral felt cost beyond bleeding fingers, failing the "unmistakable on-page price" quick test despite conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: the hair lock's glow reweights "collective will" without moralizing. Final image ("starlight carrying liberated possibility") offers non-literal answer to fear's prison, avoiding thematic echo while embracing complexity through "improbable longing" as earned subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "starlight filtered through impossible angles," with rhythm accelerating during fear-untangling. "Genetic memory of courage" slightly breaches POV plausibility, but controlled lexicon ("matryoshka dolls," "fiber optic cable") maintains distinct texture under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero synonym loops and vivid propulsion ("reality reorganize around her") elevate density. Minor register drift: "fiber optic cable" metaphor feels anachronistic in lyrical context, slightly dulling the climax's closure image without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "magical locksmith" trope via physics-defying shadows and fear-as-physical-strands. "Shadow falling upward" provides fresh inflection, though "fear as jailer" premise leans familiar. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry, but emotional specificity slightly lacks visceral uniqueness.</comment>
