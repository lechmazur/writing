<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in pacifist wielding frequency as weapon, but empathy epiphany slightly unearned without prior struggle with impatience; micro-choice "final decimal point" adjustment reveals hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: fireworks' "pause before detonation" crystallizes cost of Mara's quest with visible emotional weight; Accumulative/Textural lens held through density escalation of frequencies and communal silence tightening options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Workshop tools constrain every choice—salvaged music boxes resonate to unlock the diary, charging the final image; "tin roof caught starlight like scattered coins" exemplifies purpose-driven specificity where setting is active participant not backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through textural density: city's "holding its breath" and scanner's clicking narrow options to one decisive frequency adjustment; cost is visceral in "months building this frequency scanner" paid in Mara's reverent page-touching.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "silence" motif reweighted from technical frequency to emotional space; grandmother's diary entry avoids Thematic Echo by being diegetic, while fireworks' "perfect silence" offers resonant non-literal answer to "path to empathy" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "catalog of silences" and frequency-based noticing; rhythmic compression under pressure ("She fine-tuned...") avoids filter-verb pitfalls; single-POV consistency flawless despite lyrical density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "static crackled like distant applause" demonstrates high-density propulsion; final line's crystalline clarity ("empathy, like frequency, was something you could learn to adjust") achieves maximum resonance without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "unlocking diary" trope through frequency-scanning mechanic; emotional specificity in "silence after ceasefire" avoids generic pacifism; fresh synthesis feels inevitable as fireworks' pause mirrors diary's clasp mechanism.</comment>
