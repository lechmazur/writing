<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "luminous disbelief" vs. "sculpt possibility" motivation, but brother backstory remains abstract summary without altering present tactics; micro-choices lack concrete stakes during vanishing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("stepped onto the scaffold" foreclosing old life), but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural) persists past midpoint; scaffold map’s mechanics feel coincidental rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Wet-plate glass flake and scaffold wrap constrain choices (guiding path, projecting bridge), charging the final image; mountain air/pine scent actively shape perception during crisis with precise sensory hierarchy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elias’s vow to "recount impossible journey," but "pixelated amnesty" remains abstract concept; cost of leaving pullout is felt but not viscerally tested against prior "ashes of never" motivation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through glass flake’s shifting projections and scaffold wings, avoiding moralizing; "sculpt possibility" reweights redemption without resolution, but brother backstory’s thematic role feels underdramatized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "dynamically observant" details (light bending, scent of pine), but "luminous disbelief" repetition risks thematic echo; compression of vanishing stays legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong propulsion until scaffold wrap’s "secret mapped by movements" – near-predictable phrasing dulls high-pressure beat; final third avoids fatal artifacts but "echo of luminous disbelief" borders on loop.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bridge construction and redemption via scaffold wings, avoiding magic realism clichés; "pixelated amnesty" transforms vanishing into tangible stakes through glass flake’s physics.</comment>
