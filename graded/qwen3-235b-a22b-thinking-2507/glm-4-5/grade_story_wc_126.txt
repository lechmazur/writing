<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lacks embodied struggle in pivotal moment; epiphany feels told ("Kael realized") rather than earned through contradictory impulses. Strong trait integration via bowl handling, but mother's tears are label-only feeling without specific physicality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: "silence not absence" realization forecloses despair with visible cost (mother's tears, listing shipwrecks). Orientation solid by paragraph 1; Accumulative lens holds through density increase in final playing scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Shipwrecks function as micro-setting that constrains choice (bowl placement for amplification) and charges final image ("listing shipwrecks"). Greenhouse cracks reweighted in father's gesture, but rainforest burn lacks active pressure on current decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (beauty in silence) tightens via single deepening: chronic hush reconfigured as music. Cost legible in "tears glistened" and cracked windows, but pressure lacks escalation—realization emerges without protagonist's tactical adaptation under rising stress.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: bowl's cracks, violin drawing "music from air." Final image ("magnificence in simplicity... unfinished masterpiece") reweights premise without moralizing, avoiding Thematic Echo despite "beauty in unfinished" line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("acoustically perceptive nature detecting vibrations") with rhythmic control in playing scene. Minor register drift in "symphony of survival" and filter verbs ("Kael realized") prevent 9.0, but compression taught early pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loop early ("What he lacked in sound... detecting vibrations others could never hear") triggers -0.2. Otherwise clean propulsion, but "simple yet profound tales" is vague abstraction; final paragraph's "unfinished masterpiece" borders on overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Echo-harbor violinist" transforms trope through shipwreck acoustics and bowl amplification. Specificity in mendicant's bowl (generational, cracked) avoids generic "beauty in imperfection," though rainforest burn premise leans familiar without deeper transformation.</comment>
