<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses during peak translation; "carefully reckless" remains label-heavy without sufficient embodied tradeoffs in high-stakes choices, though motivation burns bright.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost of permanent division vs reconciliation, but cost legibility falters—final walk lacks visible consequence despite strong Accumulative lens cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Glass ink well functions as micro-setting that charges the final image ("its work done for now"), constraining choices through sensory specificity and evolving states from "glow" to "nearly empty."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via treaty deadline pressure, but escalation lacks Elena's active agency—the breakthrough emerges from textual discovery rather than her choice under duress.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing; "bridges waiting to be rebuilt" reweights the symphonies motif non-literally, though repetitive phrasing ("restore trust after silence") slightly dilutes earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("dust motes dancing," linguistic symphonies), but minor register drift occurs when "symphonies of truth" over-echoes in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor synonym churn in ink well descriptions ("crystal surface reflecting," "seemed to glow") and repetitive "restore trust" phrasing dull momentum, though rhythm supports tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "scholar saves the day" trope through linguistic specificity; "symphonies" metaphor feels fresh in context, but some atmospheric phrasing ("dust motes dancing") edges toward convention.</comment>
