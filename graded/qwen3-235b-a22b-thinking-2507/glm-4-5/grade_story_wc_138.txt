<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through concrete details ("boredom evaporated, replaced by intrigue") and embodied emotion, but Elara's backstory risks slight tell-over-show in the amulet reveal. Final choice to become guardian feels earned through prior causality with visible cost ("prismatic escondite collapsing behind him").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: "goodbye was merely a transition" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pressure builds via sensory density ("hushed thunder of the mutiny") rather than causal turns, fitting the scope perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (collapsing when he leaves) and charges the final image. Sensory details are purpose-driven: "colors shifted like the final moments of a dying rainbow" filters urgency through Alistair's perception without tourist-catalog vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single stake ("what happened after goodbye?") deepens organically when amulet's connection to Elara reconfigures options. Cost is conceptual (accepting immortality's purpose), but solar storm's role in escalation feels slightly external rather than protagonist-driven under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "goodbye was merely a transition" reweights the central question without moralizing. Final image transforms the amulet's "curse into blessing" through earned resonance, avoiding thematic echo while answering "what lies beyond farewell" with quiet profundity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("millennia stretching like taffy") and rhythmic control elevate tension. Voice modulates perfectly—lyrical during reflection, clipped during action ("He emerged")—with elision (time jumps) taught early and paid off in the dimensional transit sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; high density with "solar storm's magnetic fields reaching tendrils" doing triple duty. Minor deduction for "hushed thunder" metaphor repeating without evolution and "universe forever changed" bordering on generic in the final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms immortal tropes via specific physics ("magnetic resonance") and emotional truth. The amulet's curse-to-blessing arc feels inevitable, but spatial mutiny concept slightly echoes familiar rebellion templates without radical reconfiguration.</comment>
