<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation ("spark of defiance") clear but interior contradiction under pressure lacks embodied friction; "pure, untaxed thought" moment shows earned endurance but avoids depicting the cost of sustained defiance in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("pure, untaxed thought" amid imminent raid), driven by Accumulative/Textural lens where horticultural patterns crystallize resistance; mycelial network vibration transmission deepens final image with felt stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Chrysanthemums and gourd seed constrain choices (vibrations via soil network), while greenhouse insects provide tactical cover; "carnivorous plants luring insects in rhythmic patterns" charges closure by making communication organically inseparable from setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation through protagonist's agency (planting faster-growing species, night-blooming cereus signal) narrows options under Accumulative lens; "tomorrow's garden pattern" raises cost visibly but tension lacks a mid-scene tactical sacrifice that would tighten the band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of "pure, untaxed thought about freedom's taste" reweights the premise without moralizing, using chrysanthemums/mycelium to embody resistance as biological inevitability; "reclamation of what made them human" crystallizes theme through action, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV texture shines in "systematic arrangement of carnivorous plants" reflecting Kaelen's scholarly precision, but dialogue ("Your mint collection speaks volumes") lacks distinct idiom; entomologist's passion blurs into functional exposition during greenhouse scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "vibrations carried encoded message through soil's mycelial network" achieves high density with rhythmic propulsion. Minor register drift in "converging chaos" (para 4, 12) but payoff in closure image justifies usage.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanical espionage with thought taxation premise; "chemical properties of plants" as communication method transforms trope through specific, verifiable detail. Risk-taking (dream taxation triggering cereus bloom) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
