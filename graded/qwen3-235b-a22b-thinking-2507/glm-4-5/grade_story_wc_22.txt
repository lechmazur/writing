<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lacks interior contradiction; motivation clear but no visible struggle during seed-scattering. "Narrow vastness" stated not embodied, missing micro-choices under pressure despite strong traits. "ttk duelersi" typo undermines credibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with strong density build, but closure cost isn't legible on-page—exhaustion stated not felt. Final image reweights meaning via wildflowers, yet conceptual cost remains narrated ("smallest actions transform") rather than dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid jetty/ocean specificity anchors setting, but seed pods don't constrain choices or charge closure. Wildflowers replace pods without showing their legacy; "fragile embrace" cliché weakens originality despite strong sensory texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (healing battlefield) signaled early, but escalation falters—bird guidance removes meaningful pressure. "Narrow vastness" problem stated yet never deepened; cost (exhaustion, depleted pods) summarized not dramatized as altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (seed pods → wildflowers), but "narrow vastness" moralized in narration ("smallest actions transform infinite possibilities") violates organic emergence. Avoids sentimentality yet over-explains in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct voice ("gloom-hill," "submerged concord") with rhythmic control, but POV leaks future knowledge ("travelers would speak"). Coachman's internal voice indistinguishable from narration; "ttk duelersi" error breaks immersion during pivotal whisper.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong propulsion and specificity ("mourning cries of gulls"), but paraphrase loop ("he knew... he understood") and "fragile embrace" cliché. "ttk duelersi" typo in climax beat prevents 8.5+; final image avoids sentimentality with clean syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Transforms eco-recovery tropes via dead languages/bird calls, with "submerged concord" as fresh anchor. Avoids abstraction through seed pods/jetty, but "narrow vastness" concept feels familiar. Risk-taking heightens stakes without muddying closure.</comment>
