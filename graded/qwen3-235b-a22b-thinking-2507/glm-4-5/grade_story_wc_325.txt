<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong (claustrophobia vs purpose) but brother motivation remains told backstory; "psychic energy" label triggers -0.5 penalty in peak beats without embodied cost demonstration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation fails at 120 words (no clear "who" until paragraph 2), triggering -0.4; closure as Earned Stasis works but cost proof weak—social isolation stated but not dramatized on-page during final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Facility walls and Codex constrain choices (claustrophobia management, timed rituals), charging the final "sacred silence" image; undersea cables' role stays abstractly conceptual rather than tactilely limiting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>42-minute tide clock drives tight escalation, but dominant stake ("stand by unremembered") lacks visceral cost—social forfeiture summarized rather than tested through a concrete loss (e.g., discarded communication device).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "unremembered" shadows and final silence without moralizing; brother subplot underdevelops the central question, weakening the payoff’s emotional specificity despite resonant closing image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("damp air licked," EM field sensitivity) anchors Accumulative lens; minor register drift in "phase transitions" terminology disrupts voice consistency during high-pressure moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("dormant" instruments near "asleep" console); "fibrous veins pulsing with humanity's digital lifeblood" overwrites with mixed metaphor, slightly dulling the cable motif's clarity in a key beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of undersea cables as spirit conduits elevates ghost-story tropes, but Codex margin flecks feel derivative; risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off through tidal pressure without gimmickry.</comment>
