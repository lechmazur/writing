<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation for seeking "unused love" remains abstract despite poetic framing; no contradictory impulses or embodied struggle beyond whispered confessions to artifacts. Final choice lacks visible cost escalation beyond tearful realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly with cost ("bittersweet sacrifice" made legible through transformed letters), but lens ambiguity surfaces mid-story when "spatially imagined" phrasing momentarily mimics causal logic before reverting to Accumulative/Textural drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Projection booth functions as micro-setting that charges closure: film strip handling and sprocket holes constrain choices, while "dusty beam of light" final image reweights the entire emotional archive theme through tangible specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via Accumulative pressure as "hushed thunder" intensifies, but Elena's agency remains passive reception rather than active choice; the single tightening (letters fusing with film) lacks tangible cost beyond emotional realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "liminal spaces" motif, with final image ("pauses between heartbeats") offering resonant non-literal answer to where unused love resides, avoiding moralizing while embracing emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in tactile film handling ("feeling for subtle vibrations"), but tense instability surfaces when "the crystal gazer ran" shifts from present to past mid-scene, momentarily fracturing focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Overwriting in high-pressure beats: "spatially imaginative mind" repetition creates synonym churn, while "hushed thunder" metaphors risk muddling causality; density penalty applied but closure image ("dissolve boundaries") remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of projectionist-as-archivist transforms nostalgic trope, but "unused love" concept lacks sufficient emotional specificity; risks remain safe within literary fiction conventions despite lyrical execution.</comment>
