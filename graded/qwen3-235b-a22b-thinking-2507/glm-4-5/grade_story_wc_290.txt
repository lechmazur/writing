<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (claustrophobia vs space-longing) embodied in physical struggle during mutiny ("pain erupted along spine"), but final transformation lacks sufficient micro-choice showing enduring flaw; "wistful rebellion" label slightly undermines concrete emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost (abandoning world/tool), drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) clear by midpoint with sensory density tightening options, though portal's unexpected realm slightly strains "vital key" setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Compass constrains choice (activation mechanics) and charges final image (clattering to ground); starlight actively enables mutiny, though "faded runes" feel decorative without tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via transfix beat (visible cost narrowing options to "continue or fail"), but resolution lacks trade-off—stepping through feels purely gain-oriented without acknowledging sacrificed identity beyond compass.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through compass's charged reprise (clattering = abandoned tool/world), avoiding moralizing; "spatial mutiny" evolves into conceptual repricing, though grandfather's surface description leans sentimental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (claustrophobia filtering tunnel descriptions), rhythmic control during mutiny, but "wistful rebellion" label and church organ metaphor drift into abstraction during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold in closure beat; high density with "air grew thick/viscous" showing transfix, though "vibrating with energy" weakens verbs slightly in high-stakes sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of claustrophobia as liberation catalyst; compass subversion (portal vs physical key) feels inevitable, though two-moon realm edges toward trope without deeper integration.</comment>
