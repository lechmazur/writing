<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction emerges late; the shift from cosmic to terrestrial focus lacks visible struggle until the final realization, making the transformation feel smooth rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands via the butterfly emergence crystallizing Elena’s "true calling," but the cost of abandoning academia remains abstract—no concrete sacrifice is dramatized beyond vague mentions of "needless drama," weakening felt stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Greenhouse debris and butterfly wing dust function as micro-setting, constraining choices (e.g., stepping through debris) and charging the final image, though soil/concrete details lack tactile specificity during pivotal observations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes in "stripping needless drama" remain internalized and abstract; pressure accumulates texturally but lacks a visible price paid—Elena’s colleagues’ confusion is noted but never tests her resolve with concrete consequences.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from dust patterns mirroring galaxies, avoiding moralizing until the final line’s "true calling" risks thematic echo, nearly triggering the -0.6 penalty for overt resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines through astrophysics-trained observation ("preprocess reality"), but reflective blocks risk summary; the voice modulates effectively from clinical to lyrical as Elena’s focus shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>No prose loops or scaffold, but "cathedral" metaphor slightly strains credibility; rhythmic control excels in the butterfly emergence scene, with concrete verbs ("damp," "cracked") enhancing propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms the "epiphany in nature" trope through precise astrophysics parallels, though the cosmic-to-terrestrial shift lacks novelty; specificity in dust patterns and decay mechanics elevates beyond generic resilience narratives.</comment>
