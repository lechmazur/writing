<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (curse as danger vs. purpose) powers climax; embodied emotion ("trembling fingers," "watched in awe") avoids labels. Final choice earned by prior causality but micro-choices lack distinct value hierarchy under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost ("visions no longer tormented... guided her"); Accumulative lens holds via pattern-density escalation. Orientation clear by line 3; cost proof in "fulfilled" vs. "remained cursed" contrast.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frictionless stone constrains stance ("bare feet gripping"); tidal pools supply pattern tools. Aurora’s "borrowed dawn" charges final image. Micro-setting (painted rocks) directly shapes climax by triggering star dust eruption.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preventing cosmic unraveling) tightens via sequence complexity; cost (enduring curse with transformed meaning) legible in closure. Agency-driven escalation through stone placements, but secondary stake (self-preservation) lacks visible tradeoff during sixth stone placement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme ("patterns respected not controlled") emerges through eel movements and star dust integration; final image reweights "frictionless existence" as harmony. Avoids moralizing but "found peace" slightly over-resolves emotional complexity of precognitive curse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in math-filtered observation ("Fibonacci sequence that governed spiral galaxies"); rhythmic control accelerates during stone placements. No head-hopping; lyric compression taught early via aurora/star dust symbiosis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("collapsed star dust, its dark matter swirling"). Final line’s "peace in a world without friction" risks sentimentality but saved by concrete "gathering painted stones" action. Slight register drift in "cosmic seams" (overly abstract for her POV).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Synthesis of math/eldritch ecology feels inevitable: eels embodying Fibonacci sequences transforms trope. Risk-taking (cosmic stakes via tidal rituals) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "frictionless reality" specificity avoids generic fantasy.</comment>
