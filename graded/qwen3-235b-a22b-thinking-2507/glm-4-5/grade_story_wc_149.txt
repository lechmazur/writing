<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (duty vs. elation) embodied through translucent form and crumbling bead; micro-choice to release seeds reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost ("slowly dissipated"). Motivation anchored by concrete cue (midnight resonance), though Thomas backstory slightly exceeds BRR ceiling without sufficient micro-choice tilt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "bead began to crumble as she slowly dissipated" crystallizes debt repayment. Accumulative lens holds through density increase (resonant awakenings → seed release), taught by "pulsed with bioluminescent life" early. Orientation clear within 40 words; lens inferred by midpoint via "ephemeral cameo appearances" pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Greenhouse functions as micro-setting: frost patterns constrain her movement ("northernmost window"), while lovingly venomous pollen directly charges final image (unprecedented bloom). Recurring bead constrains choice (anchor between worlds) and charges closure (spiral bloom center). Sensory selection reflects urgency—bioluminescence noted during vigil, soil texture only when "could almost feel."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (debt repayment) signaled by "motivation driving her beyond exhaustion." Escalation via textural deepening: bead's pulse → near-substantial form → seed release. Cost legible in dissipation, but agency slightly passive as cosmic timing (midnight stars) drives the turn rather than character choice. One tightening sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "resonant awakenings" reweighted by final bloom: "defts settled" via mingled essences in petals, avoiding moralizing. Central question ("can love transcend death?") answered non-literally through the spiral bloom—a conceptual repricing where debt repayment enables rebirth. No thematic echo; final testimony line stays earned by prior particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "ashen-veil" ghost notices frost patterns and pollen density while ignoring time. Rhythmic control under pressure via fragmented syntax during seed release ("With immeasurable tenderness..."). No head-hopping; groundskeeper segment maintains single POV through his understanding ("knew debts settled"). Elision of Thomas' death taught by "perished before vows."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "lovingly venomous" repetition functions as motif (pollen → seeds) not synonym churn. High density: "frost perpetually danced" conveys setting + time + constraint. Final line avoids overwriting—"testimony that even across lifetimes" crystallizes theme through concrete image (greenhouse) rather than abstraction. Cadence shifts from lyrical to urgent during seed release.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope via alchemical specificity: debt repayment requires precise celestial mechanics ("right celestial conditions"). Fresh inflection in "lovingly venomous" duality—pollen preserves Thomas' soul while killing her. Avoids safety middle by embracing mournful elation tone; emotional complexity avoids generic templates through bead's physical decay mirroring release.</comment>
