<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear but "bravely conflicted" remains labeled rather than embodied in simultaneous contradictory actions; "her bravely conflicted heart hammered" exemplifies diagnostic label-speak without visceral tradeoffs during the critical upload sequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with "revolutionary potential" reweighting silence, but "within the blink" repetition creates a paraphrase loop that slightly dulls the decisive image; Accumulative/Textural lens holds with cost legible in her awaiting consequences.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Antarctic setting creates potent atmosphere ("amber-light," "snow crystals"), yet the echoing library functions as backdrop rather than constraining choices; thermal suit and keyboard are handled tactilely but fail to charge the final image beyond symbolic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes (duty vs truth) tighten through Elena's network access, but escalation lacks middle development—pressure jumps from discovery to upload without intermediate tactical constraints; "contraband truths" dominate but remain abstract until transmission.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly through "knowledge cries out to be free" and thawing motifs, but final paragraph's "conversations silenced for a century" edges toward thematic echo; avoids moralizing yet resolution feels slightly over-assured for the scale of risk.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV voice shines with cryo-archivist specificity ("breath stabilizers," "amber-light"), though "dizzying quiet" repetition reveals uniform stress cadence; internal monologue avoids therapy-speak but late "bravely conflicted" labels disrupt embodied urgency during the upload beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong propulsion until climax where "within the blink" paraphrase loop and stacked modifiers ("brilliantly conflicted and resolute") muddle momentum; final image’s "electricity of awakening potential" risks purple prose but salvaged by concrete "snow above" anchor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cryo-archivist premise transforms dystopian tropes through sensory Antarctic specificity, but "Federation utopia on curated history" leans derivative; bold risk in quiet closure pays off, though dormant networks lack fresh technical texture to elevate beyond standard leak narrative.</comment>
