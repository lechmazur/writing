<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses (diligence vs. distraction) but "diligently curious" is stated not embodied; no felt cost in closure beyond professional triumph.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with conceptual cost (shift from cartography to luminous pathways), but Accumulative lens ambiguity precludes higher; starlings' alignment lacks causal pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Antique airship setting provides atmospheric texture but fails to constrain choices; hopscotch board charges final image weakly though "dusty" detail hints at neglect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (professional legacy) lacks visceral escalation; "stranded luminance" discovery brings no tangible cost—only euphoric validation, missing Q4 band guardrail for 8.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of pattern recognition emerges through hopscotch/starlings but resolves into tidy professional triumph; final "kinship" image avoids moral complexity required for 8.0+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV voice consistently filters details through cartographer’s lens ("rhythm of starlings’ flight"), though "sociable isolation" summary dilutes present-moment urgency near climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Stranded luminance flickered in acknowledgment" exemplifies overwriting—anthropomorphism clashes with established physical rules; minor synonym loops ("diligently curious"/"meticulously curious") sap momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hopscotch as cipher elevates trope, but emotional stakes remain generic ambition; avoids derivative template yet lacks the bold risk-taking for 8.0+.</comment>
