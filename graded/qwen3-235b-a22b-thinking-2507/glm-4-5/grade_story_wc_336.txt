<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "insatiably creative" trait is stated but not embodied in flawed choices during the weaving. Surrender to wonder feels earned yet passive, missing visible struggle with the seed's energy that would heighten stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with Charged Poise closure (seed pulsing with wonder), but escalation lacks density increase—pressure remains static during weaving. Cost ("give pieces of oneself") is conceptual yet undramatized, weakening final image's charge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Waterfall and parapet create vivid atmosphere, but setting rarely constrains choices. Micro-setting triumph: transformed seed casting rainbow on moss charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate by reweighting wonder's preservation through concrete action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving wonder) is clear early, but pressure fails to escalate meaningfully under Accumulative lens—no deepening of risk or cost during weaving. "Giving pieces of oneself" lacks tangible dramatization, leaving cost felt but not legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through seed transformation, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("seed waited patiently... purpose unfolding") offers resonant non-literal answer to "preserving wonder," though grandmother's quote edges toward thematic echo in early reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("verdant parapet," "radiant hush") shines, but elevated diction ("thrums of life," "essence of waterfall") clashes with orchard worker POV during high-pressure weaving. Rhythmic control wavers in lyrical stretches.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density, but "heart beat with rhythm both ancient and new" risks therapy-speak in peak beat. Minor figurative muddle ("threads of blue-white light" emerging from fingers) slightly dulls closure's physical immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tropes transformed through specific sensory details (seed's rainbow on moss), but "magical gardener" premise lacks bold risk. Emotional truth in preserving wonder feels fresh, yet proximity to common eco-spiritual motifs caps originality.</comment>
