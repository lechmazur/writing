<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in "luminous regret" vs. "spark of purpose," but motivation "to understand weight of names" remains abstractly told; epiphany about names as "foundations of being" risks unearned abstraction despite strong embodied grief ("hands still gritty").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure achieves valid Charged Poise (new coin as "golden seam in broken heart"), but escalation lacks under Accumulative lens—shift from desolation to purpose feels unforced, with no meaningful pressure tightening beyond internal realization; cost legible but insufficiently earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: copper disc functions as essential constraint, charging final image ("rain-washed surfaces reflected its newfound glow"); sensory details like "steam rising like a ghostly sigh" are purposefully filtered through Elias’s grief, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (loss of wisdom) clear early, but pressure coherence falters—search party disbanding raises stakes yet creation shift lacks causal struggle; "spark of purpose" emerges without meaningful deepening, weakening cost legibility under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through kintsugi metaphor ("mending with golden purpose"), avoiding moralizing; final image ("golden seam in broken heart") resonates as non-literal answer to "weight of names," though near-abstraction of "foundations of being" slightly undermines earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("steam rising like a ghostly sigh," "rain-washed hands"); alchemist lexicon ("crucibles," "zodiac symbols") stays consistent under pressure, with rhythmic control in climax ("Aries, Taurus, Gemini..."); minor repetition of "luminous regret" avoids tic status.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with concrete propulsion ("grasped the core principle of kintsugi intentions"), but paraphrase loops ("rain-washed" x4, "broken" variants) and slight overwriting in closure ("imperfect yet more beautiful for its flaws") prevent 9+; no artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of kintsugi philosophy with alchemy avoids trope recycling; emotional specificity in "regret illuminating path forward" transforms familiar redemption arc, though "weight of names" concept edges toward abstraction without sufficient grounding in action.</comment>
