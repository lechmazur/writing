<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (doubt about worthiness) feels generic; embodied emotion strong but "luminous doubt" lacks concrete physicality; no secondary character to test relationships under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise (monsoon arrival + luminous doubt) but cost remains conceptual; Accumulative lens holds though causality frays during dream interpretation; orientation solid but lens ambiguity caps high-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Ridge setting vivid but ornamental—waterfall cave functions as micro-setting during descent yet fails to constrain choices; monsoon threat lacks spatial consequence; final image's emerald canopy doesn't charge closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve culture) clear early but pressure never tightens meaningfully; monsoon deadline creates urgency yet no trade-offs or sacrificed options; cost remains atmospheric rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through seed/lullaby without moralizing; final image reweights "luminous doubt" as conceptual cost for preservation; avoids sentimentality though "empirical and whimsical" edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("empirically whimsical" lens) shines in ridge descriptions; syntactic monotony in cave sequence dulls pressure; no dialogue to test voice distinction but reflection stays anchored to seed vibrations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Minor scaffolding ("clutched... its surface warm") and generic descriptors ("vibrant colors"); no fatal loops but "intoxicating scents" feels stock; final line's thematic phrasing risks overwriting in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Transforms fantasy tropes via knowledge fruit seed mechanics; "luminous doubt" offers fresh emotional inflection; derivative in broad "chosen one saves culture" premise despite specific cultural grounding.</comment>
