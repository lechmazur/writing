<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "grief when it held something beautiful" and "neither devastated nor pretending," with micro-choices like the first hesitant cut evolving to confidence under pressure; no stock phrasing, though "harvest lessons from loss" risks abstraction without the concrete carving action to ground it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost in "love, like everything worth keeping, could be both here and gone simultaneously," crystallizing the Accumulative/Textural lens through rain-pattern lions; orientation anchors instantly via fractured light and kettle whistle, avoiding any causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight actively constrains choice—refracting light guides carving precision and evolves into final "constellations" that charge closure; ash wood curls become memory-sorting metaphors, with "rust-hued peace" rooted in tactile autumn leaves rather than empty symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the kettle's live clock: "five minutes perhaps" escalates to "time... moved differently," narrowing options to carving as the sole act of containment; cost is embodied in stiff muscles and the "rust-hued peace" of enduring grief, though the escalation could deepen the physical toll of carving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the ash wood’s transformation—menagerie of loss becomes "hauntingly practical" art—avoiding moralizing with the resonant final image of rain-made lions; "here and gone" reweights the premise without stating a lesson, though "harvest lessons" edges toward abstraction before being redeemed by concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "crystallized time" and "rust-hued peace," with syntax mirroring carving rhythm (short cuts vs. flowing descriptions); no head-hopping, and pressure modulates voice through sensory shifts like the kettle’s "low whistle" to "screaming readiness" without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fractured light across the floor, each droplet a tiny prism" achieves high density without muddle, though "through crystallized time" slightly overwrites before being anchored by concrete examples; final line’s "captured eternity" risks cliché but earns resonance via the kettle’s temporal frame.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality lies in transforming grief via occupational specificity—measuring cage distances becomes carving grain sensitivity—avoiding tropes through "ash wood falling away like memories sorted"; the lion’s serenity (vs. husband’s snarling) reconfigures loss with emotional precision, though the "rust-hued peace" phrase leans familiar.</comment>
