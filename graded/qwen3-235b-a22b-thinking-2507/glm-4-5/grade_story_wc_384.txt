<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority vividly concrete ("hands steady despite decades") but "to forgive the unfinished" motivation remains abstractly stated without dramatized internal conflict during the climax. Contradictory impulses missing at pivotal signing moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost (blood signature dissolving key into aurora), fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation clear by word 40; no causality breaks despite single-scene constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marble sanctuary actively constrains choices (stone dissolving for hidden compartment) and charges final image. Micro-setting (crystal-preserved thorn) shapes tactics, though "pearl twilight" repetition slightly dilutes specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes (redemption vs. guilt) intensify through sensory accumulation, but "unlink" action lacks protagonist-driven escalation—key's arrival is coincidental, not earned by prior choices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "calibrated treason" reweighted by blood signature; avoids moralizing. Final image (planting thorn as renewal) offers resonant non-literal answer to betrayal without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("aurora's colors shifting from ethereal blues to soft purples") shows rhythmic control, but "wisely enduring" appears as label twice without character-particular embodiment under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density with zero figurative muddle, though "pearl twilight" repetition creates minor scaffold loop. Closure image ("stepped outside for first time") resolves with textural precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms redemption trope via calligrapher-specific details (blood as signature). Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes, though key mechanic feels familiar despite thematic integration.</comment>
