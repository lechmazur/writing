<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias' "respectfully rebellious" actions, but minor abstraction in "foster hope" line edges toward tell. Micro-choices like bottle transfer timing earn closure with palpable cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias walking into rain with "mailbag lighter," cost legible in lightning reflection on disputed territory puddles. Causal lens holds perfectly through shift-change timing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cobalt arcade pressures choices (guards entering during transfer), but "disputed territory" remains slightly generic. Bottle functions as essential micro-setting charging the final image with rain-puddle reflections.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias' agency: mapping blind spots enables the shift-change delivery. Cost is unmistakable in adrenaline surge when guards enter, narrowing options to silent transfer.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through bottled storm's evolution: from "contained violence" to "sky always clears" promise. Final image reweights weather as hope without moralizing, avoiding sentimentality through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("weathered face," noticing guard uniforms), rhythm modulates under pressure. Slight abstraction in "respectfully rebellious" during peak tension prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "contained lightning casting shadows" shows not tells. One borderline abstraction ("sanctuary for those torn apart") lacks concrete specificity but doesn't dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "smuggling hope" trope through bottled weather specificity. "Linking absences" concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking (meteorological smuggling) heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
