<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s socially perceptive trait drives concrete micro-choices (adjusting the mandala to interject) with embodied contradiction—artistic expression versus avoiding conflict—though "lilac unease" edges toward abstract labeling rather than fully sensory embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: the hush’s transformation from "lilac unease" to "deep contentment" crystallizes stakes with visible cost (Silas disassembling the mandala), perfectly aligning with the accumulative lens through the sand patterns’ reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The grotto’s acoustics actively constrain choices (mandalas amplify whispers) and charge the final image—its "emergent hush" evolving with each pattern—making the setting indispensable to both climax and thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Pressure escalates through Silas’s agency when zealots threaten order; his mandala adjustment narrows options (art as interjection), with cost legible in disassembly ("all meanings are temporary") under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—sand patterns making whispers coherent—avoiding moralizing; the final image ("wisdom emerges not from avoiding chaos...") reweights the premise without stating a moral, embodying earned complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines: Silas notices textures ("weathered walls") and sounds through an artist’s lens, with rhythm modulating under pressure (short phrases during the zealots’ arrival), no head-hopping, and patterned diction serving the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "lilac unease" risks abstraction but is redeemed by immediate sensory context; zero loops, high density, and the final line recharges the opening motif without muddling peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "wise artist" tropes via specific mechanics (sand-acoustic interaction); the unlearning concept avoids abstraction through disassembly rituals, though the grotto’s mist risks slight symbolic convenience without deeper physical constraint.</comment>
