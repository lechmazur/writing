<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak despite "historically oriented ache"; micro-choices like lens-handoff reveal hierarchy of values. Khira’s embodied contradiction—gnarled fingers shaping lost daughter’s initial while rasping "the bread remembers"—earns closure’s cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: "dread still there... pierced by vivid green resilience" crystallizes cultural reawakening’s cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density escalation ("slow roots finding light" → "distant cracking" → "impossible warmth"), narrowing options to the bread’s activation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grotto micro-setting constrains every choice: damp walls swallow sound, bioluminescent fungi replace light, and the opera glass’s emerald lens literally reveals dormant cultural memory in dough. Final image of "Khira’s defiant baking etched behind his eyes" charges closure through the tool’s specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via protagonist agency: guide’s lens-offering shifts from observation to action, forcing Khira’s choice to peer inward. Visible cost—lingering "rosewater dread" despite thaw—reweights cultural survival as fragile reclamation, not victory, under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through dough’s "slow roots finding light" reconfigured as cultural memory; no moralizing. Final image—"spark igniting long darkness"—answers "Can they rescue dying arts?" by showing identity reshaped, not restored, with dread’s persistence underscoring conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "emerald-tinted" lens refracts all description through cultural erosion ("rosewater dread," "fading tapestries"). Rhythmic control peaks when Khira’s "sharp intake of breath" interrupts the guide’s internal voice, teaching patterned elision early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cracking echoed—not stone, but ice" exemplifies multi-jobbing syntax. Minor register drift: "profound, historically oriented ache" slightly over-articulates interiority, but "sweet and cloying as rotting rosewater" rescues density without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "dying culture" trope via bread’s microbial memory—specific, non-obvious synthesis where baking initials reactivate hive-mind. Risk-taking (cultural survival hinging on dough texture) heightens stakes coherently; no generic "everywhere" setting.</comment>
