<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "yearning to expand... fearing what might lie beyond" perfectly embodies claustrophobia vs transcendence. Grandfather's journals slightly undermine motivation authenticity despite strong embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: the final image of doll/vessel "acknowledging each other" crystallizes transformed relationship to confinement. Only minor deduction for slightly underplayed physical struggle during ascent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Xenial trellis functions as micro-setting that constrains choice via gravity inversion window, charging the final image through the doll/vessel duality. Bunker lacks sufficient tactile specificity to reach 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Gravity inversion creates perfect causal tightening - the "precious sixty minutes" clock drives every tactical choice. Dominant stake (claustrophobia vs transcendence) escalates through agency-driven ascent with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through silence tasting metaphors; final image reweights confinement/transcendence without moralizing. Grandfather's "source of all true understanding" borders on thematic echo, preventing 9-band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sensory tasting ("forest silence tasted of rain and earth") shines. Slight register drift in "xenial trellis" and "intangibly tangible" disrupts voice consistency under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density ("hollow quiet of the middle sky"), but "intangibly tangible" functions as mixed metaphor and "sprout new awareness" edges toward cliché in peak ascent beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of claustrophobia + silence tasting elevates familiar gravity inversion trope. Emotional specificity in "taste" metaphors avoids generic abstraction despite minor New Age echoes in "gilded hush" description.</comment>
