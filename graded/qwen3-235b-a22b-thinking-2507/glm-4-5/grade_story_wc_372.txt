<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation burns clearly but lacks contradictory impulses; his "gently meticulous" nature informs actions (ledger precision) yet no internal struggle complicates choices when hope emerges (para 12), leaving endurance untested by meaningful friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (vows pulse with renewed vigor), with felt cost in fading light; however, the "discovery" of reinforcement method lacks causal buildup—it emerges without narrowing options or raising stakes under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The frozen library actively constrains Elias: ice-encrusted windows limit light for measurements (para 5), and the quartz hush physically "presses against his skin" (para 4), directly charging the final image where the library "brightens" around him (para 14).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving vows) remain abstract; pressure never tightens as Elias faces no concrete obstacle beyond gradual fading. The "discovery" of reinforcement method (para 12) feels unearned—no prior failure or cost alters tactics, violating Accumulative escalation requirements.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "faint, like distant stars about to burn out" (para 5) reweights to "pulsed with renewed vigor" (para 14), offering a resonant non-literal answer to oblivion without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice embodies Elias’s precision via rhythmic control ("turning it in his gloved hands," "handwriting as precise as the measurements"), with perceptual signature in frequency-focused noticing; no head-hopping or register drift even under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor scaffold loops: "while illusions faded to memory" (para 3, 8, 13) repeats without deepening pressure. Template cadence in measurement sequences ("Elias lifted... placed... watched") dulls immediacy slightly in high-focus beats (paras 5-6).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "last guardian" trope through specific mechanics (frequency sampling, brass/crystal device); the luminous vows concept feels fresh via "fragments of promises" made tangible as light patterns, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
