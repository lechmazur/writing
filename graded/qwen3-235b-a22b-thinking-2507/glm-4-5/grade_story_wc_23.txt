<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract despite vivid scars; "geography of loss" motivation lacks contradictory impulses in action. Micro-choices like censer handling show embodied stakes but epiphany stays tell-driven.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: ship's lights blinking twice crystallizes redemption with felt cost of past losses. Orientation clear by 80 words; moon-phase escalation tightens navigation options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Starlit station and censer foot constrain choices—heat forces navigator to "build bridge between tides." Final image of censer glowing while ship approaches charges closure through tactile pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via moon-phase constraint: censer’s waxing strength narrows navigation window. Agency in rearranging equipment shows cost of past failures, but reverse migration’s spiritual stakes remain under-tested on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "silver thread" metaphor reweighted by final homecoming. Avoids moralizing; "geography of loss" gains resonance via censer’s heat and blinking lights without abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: navigator notices "patina bronze" and "shadows" as tools, not decoration. Stress compresses diction ("Build the bridge between tides") without breaking voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "gibbous moon cast long shadows" propels scene. Minor overwriting in "raw solace came in these moments" dilutes pressure but doesn’t obscure closure’s tactile heat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via censer’s moon-phase physics and "reverse migration" as spiritual return. Specificity in "patches of skin grafted from donors" avoids generic post-apocalyptic clichés.</comment>
