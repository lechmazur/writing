<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid but awakenings lack contradictory struggle; "exchanging certainty for curiosity" reads as diagnostic label-speak without embodied cost during pivotal transformation beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with "frozen music" realization, but cost of dissolved certainty remains abstract—no on-page struggle or tangible consequence makes the price legible despite thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sound wave garden creates lush atmosphere, but fails the 9+ gate: it doesn't constrain choices or alter tactics—the hobo nickel alone charges the final image when replaced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes (artistic certainty vs curiosity) deepen through awakenings under accumulative lens, but pressure lacks agency—Elena receives revelations rather than wrestling with trade-offs that narrow options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from sensory particulars; final image of the humming mural reweights "frozen music" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite near-miss in epiphany phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sound-to-color translation, but voice lacks modulation under peak stress—diction stays uniformly lyrical during awakenings without showing cognitive disruption.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical but subtle scaffold appears: "nested awakenings compounded" feels thematic rather than character-driven, and repetitive cadence in revelation beats slightly dulls momentum near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory perception and art restoration; risk in accumulative structure pays off through inevitable-feeling reconfiguration, though transformation edges toward tidiness without sufficient friction.</comment>
