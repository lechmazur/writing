<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lack of embodied contradiction in peak moments; "resiliently positive" appears as label twice without showing internal struggle against fear during convergence, reducing emotional authenticity despite clear motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("complete yet ephemeral"), but childhood backstory summary dilutes causality; the accident explains motivation but isn't dramatized with micro-choices that alter tactics during the grotto sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Spectral grotto actively constrains choice (timing convergence under three moons) and charges closure; "stalactites of frozen time" and hourglass sand as neural pathways transform setting into functional pressure point rather than backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Liam's radio coordination and throttle adjustment narrows options meaningfully, but crew's fretting introduces no tangible opposition; cost ("complete yet ephemeral") is legible but lacks visceral felt weight during the merger climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (hourglass sand as neural pathways), avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights "fractured realities" without stating a moral, though "taught time itself new patterns" risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("scent of ozone," "liquid starlight") persists under pressure, but "resiliently positive" appears verbatim twice as label; radio dialogue with Althea shows indirection yet slightly flattens under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>No fatal loops, but "interconnected patterns" repeated four times with near-identical syntax dulls propulsion; template cadence ("He picked up... He adjusted... He removed...") in climax sequence slightly impedes momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-travel tropes via commuter-ferry mechanics and hourglass physics; "three moons as past/present/future" transforms familiar imagery through character-specific stakes without abstraction.</comment>
