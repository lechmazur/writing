<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in withdrawal (cowardice vs. destined purpose) earns transformation, but "shivering bliss" risks label-only emotion; embodied cold/warm paradox salvages peak moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: irreversible change forecloses ordinary service with felt cost ("something within Galen had changed irrevocably"); Accumulative lens holds through density increase in reality overlap.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard constrains every choice—crystalline fruit enables the unsnapping, phosphorescent vines frame discovery; final image of "colors speaking a language he nearly understood" charges closure through setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency (practicing murmured allegiance), but "countless other possibilities" dilutes dominant stake; cost legible via irrevocable change though escalation lacks visceral pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through final image of "keeper of whispered allegiances," avoiding moralizing; "shape of possibility" reweights withdrawal as purposeful rather than cowardice without stated thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "ink seemed to shift subtly beneath his gaze"; rhythmic control under pressure ("fingers curled into a configuration that defied natural anatomical limitations") avoids head-hopping despite reality overlap.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Dust rose like tiny spirits" risks overwriting in high-pressure beat; minor scaffold in "time seemed to both stand still and rush forward" but propulsion remains strong through crystalline fruit's chime activating unsnapping.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Synthesizes knightly tropes with metaphysical puppetry through specific "forgotten patterns of movement"; greenhouse's endless twilight transforms withdrawal into active guardianship without gimmickry.</comment>
