<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rennett's motivation for apology lacks sufficient interiority; "uncommonly thoughtful" trait stated but not deeply tested under pressure. Lyra's embodied emotion shines through drawer pull warmth and moon phase focus, with contradictions (patience vs urgency) driving her final forgiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly with moon phase/drawer pull pressure building to Charged Poise closure. Cost is undeniable in Rennett's relaxed shoulders after "I apologize," though moon synchronization mechanics could tighten causality earlier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drawer pull functions as essential micro-setting that charges closure, but parapet setting remains atmospheric rather than constraining choices. Mist obscures vision yet fails to actively pressure tactics despite strong sensory integration ("wind whipped hair," "rough as stone").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (emotional reconciliation) tightens meaningfully through the apology/forgiveness timeframe. Visible cost in Rennett's physical release earns the climax, though one escalation beat suffices for this length; Lyra's ritual setup drives agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through drawer pull's transformation—from keepsake to reconciliation symbol—without moralizing. Final "recycle mistakes into wisdom" line resonates as earned insight, not prompt-like echo, reweighting the central question through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in Lyra's moon-phase focus and tactile object awareness. Voice modulates perfectly under pressure (shortened sentences during confrontation), with dialogue carrying subtext ("Neutral territory isn't just geography") and Rennett's rough cadence contrasting her precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Minor scaffold ("Lyra was known as uncommonly thoughtful") and near-duplicate "storm-worn" usage prevent 9.0. Otherwise, high-density prose with strong verbs ("clutched," "pierced," "untether") and no figurative muddle in peak beats; rhythm accelerates during the apology/forgiveness exchange.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of diplomatic ritual with emotional reconciliation via moon phases/drawer pull. Avoids trope safety through specific lived detail (fathers' connection), though prisoner exchange premise isn't radically new; risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
