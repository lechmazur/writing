<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in key beats; "astonished" trait stated but not embodied through struggle. Final choice earned via prior clues but cost remains abstract (spiritual smiles insufficient). Strong micro-choices like finger-to-lips gesture show mute eloquence, yet motivation stays conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (box opening reconfigures covenant meaning) with conceptual cost (bee dissolving = impermanence of preservation). But escalation lacks pressure density—discovering the box's requirement feels static, no narrowing of options under Accumulative lens. Orientation perfect by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Apiary setting vividly rendered but rarely constrains choices; "scorched wasteland" atmospheric without tactical pressure. Stained glass box charges final image decisively (golden bee release), meeting 9+ gate requirement. Sensory details like "prismatic shadows" reflect urgency yet hives remain backdrop rather than active constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving unspoken words) signaled early but never tested concretely—no rising opposition beyond others' dismissal. Climax lacks felt cost; spiritual smiles feel insufficient payoff. Agency passive (sitting in silence) fits Accumulative lens but pressure doesn't deepen meaningfully beyond initial clue-discovery beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "mute eloquence" motif without moralizing. Final bee dissolution reweights "preservation" as ephemeral—a perfect Conceptual Repricing. Avoids thematic echo while embracing complexity (silence as both burden and gift). Resonant non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystalline: "prismatic shadows," "smoke in desert wind" filter all observation through recluse's tranquility. Rhythmic control under pressure exceptional—cadence shifts from fractured light to crystalline silence. Zero head-hopping; voice modulates perfectly with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "wax that never hardened" multiplies meaning across beats. Final line ("ghostly smiles... proper keeper") crystallizes theme without sentimentality. Minor deduction: "tangled covenant" repetition slightly dilutes density in mid-section, though never muddles closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ghosts + beekeeping covenant transforms tropes through specific, lived detail (oak barrels, honey extractors). "Silence as preservation" twist feels inevitable yet revelatory. Risks Accumulative structure successfully; emotional specificity avoids abstraction. One fresh inflection: dissolving bee redefines covenant.</comment>
