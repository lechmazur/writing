<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her "detachment when serving" versus hidden affection, but late phrases like "concealed both joy and anguish" verge on diagnostic label-speak, slightly undermining embodied emotion during the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as she preserves the diary, crystallizing the captain's dual existence with conceptual cost—but the weight of "silent promise" feels stated rather than viscerally shown in the final image, missing cost proof.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The goggles function as micro-setting, constraining decryption tactics and charging the final image; however, the icebound spire remains atmospheric backdrop rather than actively shaping choices beyond providing light refraction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through her accumulating reflections, but the "scattered light" breakthrough lacks visible cost—her emotional shift feels earned yet the conceptual price isn't dramatized physically, missing 8.8+ band requirements for tangible cost linkage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the goggles' light refraction metaphor, with the final line ("deepest truths unfold in quietest moments") offering resonant, non-literal closure without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite near-miss sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in light/ice observations sustains Accumulative lens, but "warmly inquisitive" slips into authorial label early on, slightly muddying POV modesty during high-pressure decryption.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rich textural specificity falters with minor scaffold: "her role had never been more meaningful" tells rather than shows her shift, and repetitive "scattered light" phrasing risks overwriting in the climax beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms airship tropes through the goggles-as-key mechanic, with emotional specificity in the captain's "two skies" making the universal ache of duty versus love feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
