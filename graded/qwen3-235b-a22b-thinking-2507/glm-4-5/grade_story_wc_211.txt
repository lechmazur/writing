<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown via archival shift to emotional preservation, but childhood memory trigger lacks causal setup; embodied "velvet disquiet" elevates though field trip feels retrofitted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost ("downfall of the city"), but accidental prophecy via memory breaks Accumulative lens coherence; foghorn silence anchors stakes early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orchard garden constrains choices (emotional pattern preservation), wax cylinder charges final image; "velvet disquiet" and unripened fruit deepen atmosphere without symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake tightens when prophecy emerges, but escalation relies on coincidental memory trigger rather than protagonist agency under Accumulative lens; foghorn silence provides live clock.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of preserving emotional legacy emerges through wax cylinder/orchard without moralizing; final candlelit image reweights "archaeologist of human emotion" with conceptual cost of impending silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("whisper of history etched in stone"), rhythmic control in prophecy scene; minor register drift in "archaeologist" phrase disrupts voice under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("rustling... seemed louder"/"breeze rustling leaves") and "unripened fruit" repetition dull momentum; no closure artifacts but density falters in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oath-keeping with audio archaeology; "velvet disquiet" elevates, but orchard-on-skyscraper leans on urban fantasy tropes without sufficient transformation.</comment>
