<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in Elias (scientific belief vs emotional longing) feels authentic, but Captain Morgan remains functional rather than fully dimensional. "Screaming tenderness" phrasing risks abstraction yet gains specificity through the jasmine ritual. Sister connection lacks sufficient prior causality for full emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with the vibration's return, making the cost legible through Elias's tears and the vial's warmth. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently as sensory density builds toward the resonant reconfiguration. One tightening (whisper → returned pulse) suffices for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse and jasmine function as micro-setting: the flower's scent directly charges the final image and constrains Elias's method. Selective sensory details (humming symbols, potent fragrance) avoid checklist clichés. Misses 9-band as environment doesn't actively shape tactics beyond symbolic use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving whispers > shouts) tightens through Elias's ritual, with the cost crystallizing in his tears and the sister's sudden belonging. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via sensory deepening. Coincidence (sister's reaction) complicates but doesn't resolve—the earned connection stems from Elias's agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (vial, jasmine, cobalt light), avoiding moralizing. Captain's closing line risks thematic echo but earns resonance through earned character shift. "Screaming tenderness" concept integrates well though final "pure intent" phrasing edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Elias's vibration-focused noticing; rhythm modulates beautifully from calm dawn to heart-pounding climax. Free indirect style ("he had a secret method") maintains consistent psychic distance. No head-hopping despite dual locations; focalization stays anchored in Elias's experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "potent and haunting" jasmine does triple duty (sensory, emotional, symbolic). "Screaming tenderness" recurs purposefully but risks abstraction in climax. Final line's "screaming tenderness" slightly strains register yet avoids therapy-speak through embodied context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse trope via vibration theory and "screaming tenderness" synthesis. Fresh inflection in using scent as vibrational conduit rather than mere symbol. Avoids derivative pitfalls through specific cobalt/jasmine details. Risks abstraction but earns cohesion through sensory rigor.</comment>
