<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation ("rebuild via rhythm") is clear and embodied in micro-choices (precise steps/strikes), but lacks deeper internal contradiction; flaws don't compound meaningfully under pressure despite strong sensory specificity in actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: "shared balance returning" crystallizes the Accumulative lens with conceptual cost (banished collapse), though the threat's immediacy weakens the felt price; orientation anchors (archway/dusk) established within 50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cobblestones function as micro-setting, constraining Silas's choices and charging the final image ("worn pathways glowed faintly"); sensory details (vibrations, dust motes) evolve causally with plot, avoiding static symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes ("before collapse") tighten through accumulating vibrations, but the imbalance lacks active resistance; pressure grows via density increase under Accumulative lens, yet the cost remains abstract without tangible forfeiture on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (sound restoring decay), avoiding moralizing; the final image ("sanctuary balanced on edge of dawn") reweights "shared balance" non-literally, though the resolution leans slightly toward tidy restoration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("thrumbing with latent energy only he perceived") and rhythmic control under pressure; voice modulates from "profound silence" to "quiet hum," with no head-hopping or register drift in this single-POV piece.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("fractured windowpane fused, cracks spiderwebbing backwards into wholeness") with clear propulsion, though "bruised sky" edges toward cliché; no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound physics and restoration mythos; specific "ebony tuning fork" and "rhythm of footsteps" transform tropes, though the "ghost town revival" premise risks familiarity without deeper moral complexity.</comment>
