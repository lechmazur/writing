<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "wistful yet determined" stance; embodied emotion via "pearl of stillness settling" avoids labels. Final renunciation of space travel feels earned through sea glass transformation, though grandmother backstory slightly over-tells micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "earthbound existence didn't seem like restriction" reweights premise while "illness that bound her" makes physical limitation palpable. Accumulative lens holds perfectly as sea glass patterns progressively deepen meaning without causal gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Serpentine grotto actively constrains choice (collecting sea glass, projecting light patterns) and charges final image. Sea glass functions as micro-setting that evolves from "roughened edges" to "fireless" star maps, directly shaping the closure's "misty sanctuary" resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: "share light without fire" motivation deepens as sea glass reveals "patterns unlike telescope," narrowing options toward earthbound purpose. Cost crystallizes in "no longer weighed down by what could never be" with visceral acceptance of physical limitation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sea glass physics ("bending light... never touching") rather than statement. Final image reweights "earthbound" as unique vantage point without moralizing, though "zephyr bloom" slightly edges toward thematic echo in closing paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "serpentine grotto" and "reflectively vibrant" sea glass. Rhythmic control tightens during polishing ("weigh... testing... transform") but "pearl of stillness" slightly overwrites emotional compression under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in "zephyr bloom of inspiration" disrupts momentum; "pearl of stillness" slightly strains metaphor coherence. Otherwise strong propulsion through concrete actions ("worn smooth by ocean's patient hands"), but two lyrical phrases in final third cap high-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms disability narrative through sea glass optics. "Reflectively vibrant" specificity avoids stock "star-gazer" tropes, while grotto-to-sanctuary arc feels inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens emotional truth without gimmickry.</comment>
