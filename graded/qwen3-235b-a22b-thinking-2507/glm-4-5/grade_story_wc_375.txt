<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (mnemonic gift as blessing/curse) drives choice to paint authentically; embodied "auroral sorrow" avoids cliché but motivation for initial block remains slightly abstract despite the lock metaphor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: portrait's "luminous echo" reconfigures meaning with visible cost in "blackened fingers" now feeling like "homecoming"; accumulative lens holds as mineral glow tightens pressure toward rebirth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cave functions as micro-setting: moonstone columns guide tracing, amethyst glow reveals hidden blues in portrait, directly constraining choice and charging the final image where crystals "witnessed his rebirth."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (authenticity vs validation) tightens through protagonist's realization that "broken combination lock" was his own fear; cost legible in transformed relationship to charcoal as "homecoming rather than haunting."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reprise: portrait as "mirror and window" answers central question without moralizing; avoids final-paragraph trap by having "luminous echo" embody earned wisdom through specific act of painting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("charcoal-fingered," "auroral sorrow") with rhythmic control; sentence variations under pressure ("His fingers were blacker than ever...") avoid template cadence while teaching the accumulative pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion but minor scaffold in "Cora had always said..." slightly explains shown conflict; no figurative muddle in peak beats where "charcoal met canvas" crystallizes action with visceral clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms artist-block trope through mineral metaphors ("crystal veins," "moonstone patterns"); "broken combination lock" reprise feels inevitable in hindsight while risking lyrical compression that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
