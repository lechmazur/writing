<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maia's "furiously tranquil" expression and cartography motivation show embodied contradiction, but scars metaphor remains abstract without tangible physical cost during writing. Interiority avoids therapy-speak yet lacks visceral degradation under stress when handling the envelope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: "everyone could read your poetry" reweights censorship with undeniable social cost. Accumulative lens holds via storm density, though the timer-to-writing transition lacks causal pressure in the final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Observatory constrains choice (isolation enabling rebellion) and charges final image ("rarefied air"), but telescope remains ornamental. Sensory details like "storm-kissed wonder" are vivid yet over-rely on visual abstraction during high-pressure writing moments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through "masks slip" timeframe tightening tactics, with timer beeps driving escalation. Cost is conceptual (truth's fragility) but lacks physical manifestation—thunder rumbles like censors yet never disrupts her actual writing process.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically via cartography scars motif, avoiding moralizing. Final line reweights censorship through "rarefied air" imagery, though "storm-kissed wonder" slightly overstates the earned ambiguity in peak resistance moments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("verses formed by lightning shadows") modulates rhythm effectively. Minor register drift occurs in "cartography of scars" abstraction during high-stress writing, momentarily violating Maia's plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong propulsion but scaffold appears: "years of practice keeping revolutionary thoughts hidden" tells rather than shows. "Claws of something fighting to be born" risks cliché in closure beat, slightly dulling the final image's impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of darkroom timer in observatory transforms oppression tropes. Bus timetable discovery avoids Wikipedia-vibe through hash-marked marginalia, yet the vigil framework leans on familiar revolutionary-poet conventions without radical reinvention.</comment>
