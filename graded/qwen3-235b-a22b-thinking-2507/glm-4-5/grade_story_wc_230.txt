<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in ritual execution (rational method vs emotional release), but "rational" trait lacks active testing during climax; tears as embodied cost for self-acceptance are visceral and earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "profound stillness" after tears reconfigures stakes with felt cost. Accumulative lens holds through name-recitation density; second glass eye discovery avoids coincidence penalty by charging final image thematically.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hanging orchard constrains choices (storms mask relic use) and charges closure ("broken and beautiful" illumination). Micro-setting mastery: truffle-fork soil-scanning directly enables the pivotal discovery beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when Elara speaks her own name, shifting from occlusion to self-acceptance. Cost is unmistakable: tears and exhaustion foreclose the "blocking" path while opening healing, driven purely by protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through relic discovery: "fractured grace" reweights empathy as gift without moralizing. Final image ("storm clearing behind her") offers resonant non-literal answer to "connection vs boundaries" question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("arthritic fingers," "fractal patterns like frozen lightning") modulates rhythm under pressure. Minor deduction for verbatim "fractured grace" repetition risking scaffold in high-stakes beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero figurative muddle in peak beats, but "fractured grace" repetition creates a paraphrase loop (-0.2). Opening sentence slightly over-engineered ("meticulously scanned... poised to detect"); final image propulsion flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms empathy trope via truffle-forager lens: relics as intentional navigation tools feel inevitable. "Fractured grace" synthesizes emotional truth with fresh specificity—no safety-middle hedging.</comment>
