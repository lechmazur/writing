<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Diagnostic label-speak ("buried talents," "substituting reality nightly") triggers -0.5 penalty; no contradictory impulses or embodied struggle during pivotal moments. Epiphany lacks causal foundation—no micro-choices show her wrestling with the concept of home before the feather solves everything. Passivity undermines earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation test fails: no clear anchor for who Maven is or where the mountain exists by 120 words, capping Q3 at 7.0. Closure (Conceptual Repricing) lacks visible cost—hidden thunder remains abstract, and the feather resolves her search without prior struggle. Lens ambiguity weakens escalation under Accumulative/Textural framing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Bookstore setting is vivid but ornamental; corridors reshape magically via feather without constraining choices. Mercury glass and feather fail to charge the final image meaningfully—they enable solutions rather than limit tactics. Sensory details ("scent of aging paper") are generic and don’t reflect urgency under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>No escalation of pressure: "hidden thunder" is mentioned but never dramatized as a threat, and the stone/feather solve her search instantly. Stakes remain abstract—no trade-offs or narrowing options. Resolution relies on coincidence (finding objects), not protagonist agency; no visible price paid for understanding home.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Thematic echo in final paragraph ("carried home within her, written in the language of possibility") triggers -0.6 penalty. Theme stated explicitly rather than emerging from particulars; "connections between places" lacks earned ambiguity. Recurring motifs (feather, stone) don’t constrain choices—they’re magical solutions that avoid genuine thematic complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV modesty fails: "unbeknownst to herself" violates what Maven can know, and "hidden thunder" blurs objective/perceptual reality. Voice shifts between poetic ("mercury-glass seer") and clinical ("substituting reality nightly") without character-specific rhythm under stress. Perceptual signature lacks bias—no selective noticing tied to her seer role.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Filter-verb stack in high-pressure beat ("Maven noticed that the hidden thunder... was growing closer") triggers -0.5 penalty. Paraphrase loop: "crafting worlds that only existed in the space between heartbeats" redundantly echoes "substituting reality nightly." Template cadence ("Every shelf overflowed... Maven felt...") dulls immediacy in opening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Derivative premise: "bookstore as nexus of stories" echoes Borges without fresh inflection. "Feather as reality-shaper" is tropey and swappable (crystal, stone). Emotional truth is generic—"never feel lost again" lacks specificity. Transformation test fails: plot works unchanged with "library" instead of "bookstore mountain."</comment>
