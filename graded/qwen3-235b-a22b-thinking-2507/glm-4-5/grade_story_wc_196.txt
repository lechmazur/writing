<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete actions (dust pattern analysis), but emotional contradiction under pressure lacks layered irrationality; "tactfully hopeful" repeats without deepening micro-choices during pivotal reunion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with cost ("fractured souls...bound"), but button discovery feels convenient without prior setup; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through dust pattern escalation to crystallized connection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dust patterns function as micro-setting that constrains choices and charges final image; file room details ("tarnished brass," "fine particles") vividly shape Eleanor’s tactics, though park backdrop remains ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (connection vs isolation) tightens via dust analysis forcing file selection; Benjamin’s arrival crystallizes stance with visible cost ("fractured souls"), though emancipation timeframe lacks live-clock pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars (winter coat, stray dog); final button image reweights "invisible threads" without moralizing, avoiding all anti-patterns while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in dust observations, but "unfurl the mystery" drifts into non-archivist lexicon; dialogue sparse yet natural with distinct subtext in Benjamin’s weathered return.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop: "tactfully hopeful" verbatim repetition; "fractured journeys/fractured souls" borders thematic echo, but no closure artifacts and strong verbs ("radiating circles") sustain propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms foster care trope via dust pattern method; emotional specificity in "thirteen placements" and stray dog avoids sentimentality; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
