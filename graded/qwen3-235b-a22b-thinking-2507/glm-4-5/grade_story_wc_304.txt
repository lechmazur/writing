<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in sister's death drives micro-choices like scent-infusion ("You liked apples"), with embodied cost in her "radiant hush" endurance. Interior contradiction (beautician/mortician duality) acts simultaneously during memory capture, though flaw integration slightly lacks visceral friction in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("pattern of the next journey began to reveal itself") lands with conceptual cost (perpetual burden of preservation) under Accumulative lens. Orientation clear by 50 words; density escalation in "strands of memory weaving" tightens stakes without causal breaks, though one decisive intensification barely avoids mid-band cap.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Skyborne grotto under aurora constrains choices: refracting crystals amplify connection during memory infusion, while aurora's "strengthening" directly charges the final image of Elara watching new patterns. Micro-setting (emerald chip on heart) forces tactile decisions with emotional specificity, meeting 9+ gate via environment charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize early ("breaking through silence to find pattern") with one deepening ("strands of memory weaving") narrowing options to completion. Cost legible in "timeless work" endurance under Accumulative lens, though internal conflict lacks sufficient friction against her mortician duty to breach 8.8 band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "emerald sparks" motif reweighted at closure—not as moral but as "hidden beauty in all things" crystallized in aurora-painted final image. Avoids sentimentality via concrete particulars (orchard scent, rain-dancing), though "oblivion" abstraction slightly dilutes earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("seeing beyond physical vessel to energy") shapes selective noticing of static frequencies, with rhythmic control in "like a radio dial finding frequency" compression. Voice modulates effectively under pressure, though "radiant hush" repetition risks scaffold without full payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("radiant hush" x2, "threshold of stillness" x2) trigger −0.3 deduction; elevated diction ("lucidly watchful") fits POV but density borders overwriting in memory-weaving beat. Strong propulsion otherwise, though closure beat lacks 9+ zero-loop rigor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mortician/beautician role with aurora-powered memory preservation avoids trope via specific grotto mechanics. Emotional truth in "failed to save sister" motivation elevates premise, though risk-taking stays within lyrical safety margins without transformative structural boldness.</comment>
