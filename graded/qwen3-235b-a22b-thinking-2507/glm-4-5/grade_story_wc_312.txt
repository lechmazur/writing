<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lack of contradictory embodied emotion during mending climax; "brittle devotion" risks label-speak without sufficient physical manifestation in peak stress. Interior contradiction strong but could deepen under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise flawless: "lukewarm" bell tone crystallizes cosmic realignment with visible cost in renewed "brittle devotion" of ship captains. Accumulative lens holds through dripping-rate density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sapphire viaduct constrains choice (kneeling on smooth stones) and charges climax ("liquid sky" refraction). Dripping water as micro-setting directly enables mending method and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation through Accumulative lens: dripping-rate obsession intensifies pressure to single cosmic realignment. Cost legible in "brittle devotion" becoming tangible as ship captains' renewed faith.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "lukewarm" bell tone reweights naivety as cosmic virtue without moralizing. Final image offers resonant answer via silent ring restoring sea's rhythm.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in water-rhythm fixation; rhythmic control peaks with "too fast one hour, too slow next" compression. No head-hopping; lexicon stays mage-consistent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dripping rates counting down" achieves triple duty (character/plot/theme). Final line "sea had warmed beneath repaired bell" charges closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "mending trope" via dripping-rate mechanics; emotional truth in naivety-as-strength avoids cliché. Risk-taking (silent bell ringing) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
