<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority richly embodied ("calloused fingers," "drowsy alertness"), but core motivation ("weight of swallowed truth") remains abstract without concrete prior stakes. Contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. supernatural pull) act simultaneously, earning the final renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Marcus's realization that truths "carry weight precisely because unspoken" reconfigures meaning with felt cost ("weight of his own swallowed truths acknowledged"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds throughout, though escalation lacks visceral tightening beyond sensory accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (beaded valve wheel) charges the final image ("secrets released into morning air"), but tunnel setting remains atmospheric backdrop without constraining choices. Sensory details vivid yet static—damp air and brass glint enrich texture but don’t alter tactics during pivotal beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth as burden vs. liberation) tightens via radio confession’s "hush," narrowing Marcus’s options to sharing or silencing. Cost is legible ("weight in chest like lead"), but external pressure feels muted; conflict relies on internal revelation rather than active opposition testing commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: final image of the valve wheel’s "secrets released" reweights "swallowed truth" without moralizing. Epiphany ("truths carry weight because unspoken") arises from concrete particulars, avoiding abstraction while inviting reflection on silence’s burden.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("beam cutting oppressive darkness," "drowsy alertness") modulates rhythm under pressure. Minor tell in "religious skeptical nature" slightly dulls immediacy, but voice remains cohesive with stress-appropriate compression ("He closed his eyes, surrendering...").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose largely clean with high density ("brass surface glinting like lost treasure"), but scaffold phrase "his motivation wasn’t fame or fortune" interrupts momentum. No loops, though "drowsy alertness" repetition lacks deepening in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "factory ghost shift" as metaphor for communal trauma transforms supernatural trope through specific details (valve wheel, radio confessions). Avoids cliché by centering emotional weight over scares, with verifiable mill-explorer authenticity.</comment>
