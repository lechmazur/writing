<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elena’s embodied rebellion via drumming and contradictory impulses (defiance vs sorrow) drive her choices, but Theo’s off-page presence limits relationship-as-crucible depth despite strong micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("Elena knew this was temporary") under Accumulative/Textural lens; the lagoon’s manifestation reconfigures stakes through sensory density without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sound wave garden actively constrains choices (drumming unlocks doors) and charges the final image; its vibrating metal surface becomes the tactile vessel for entanglement, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elena’s drumming agency under Accumulative lens, but the 4-minute outage relies slightly on coincidence; cost ("fragile hope") is felt yet lacks concrete forfeiture beyond temporal limitation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through auric lagoon’s evolution from memory to reality, avoiding moralizing; final line’s "sanctuary built of defiance and love" resonates without stating a thesis, though "defiance" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("notes becoming flowers of light") and rhythmic control peak during drumming climax; lyric compression taught early pays off in lagoon manifestation without POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "liquid light responding to emotions" exemplifies high-density imagery. Minor filter-verb use ("she knew") in low-pressure beats avoids muddying closure’s propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of neural entanglement with sound-as-light physics feels inevitable; risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "auroral sorrow" borders on familiar phrasing.</comment>
