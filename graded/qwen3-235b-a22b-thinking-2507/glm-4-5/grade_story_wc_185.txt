<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mapkeeper’s interiority avoids therapy-speak; embodied contradiction in preserving tradition while embracing evolution feels earned through tracing ice patterns and the final smile. Energy beings’ transformation into harmonic contributors deepens stakes without flattening conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: the mapkeeper’s endurance creates "hammered repose" with visible cost in the energy beings’ reconfigured vibrations. Causal lens holds throughout, with ice-crack discovery narrowing options to the bloom of hush.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ice Sanctum micro-setting constrains the solution—crack patterns directly enable the counter-frequency. Final image’s "silent point of potential" charges the environment, though "fractured patterns" slightly generic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single tightening via ice notation discovery forces trade-off: risk using bloom of hush or lose ripple marks forever. Cost is legible in the mapkeeper’s focused intent ("hammered repose") as chaotic vibrations settle into complementary rhythm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action—harmony via resonance, not opposition—culminating in the final image reweighting "silent point of potential" as seed of harmony. Zero moralizing; "examine crack patterns" explains method, not theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ripple marks," "thrummed," "bloom of hush") reflects mapkeeper’s expertise. Rhythmic control modulates from urgent ("clutching echo chamber stone") to lyrical ("sphere of utter stillness") without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "gently luminous" evolves meaningfully across beats. Minor deduction for "profound quiet" bordering abstraction, but saved by concrete "sphere of stillness" imagery. Final line achieves textural specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of geological observation and sonic harmony avoids trope recycling. "Bloom of hush" transforms clichéd calm-storm tropes via ice-crack method; emotional truth in peace-through-engagement resonates beyond surface novelty.</comment>
