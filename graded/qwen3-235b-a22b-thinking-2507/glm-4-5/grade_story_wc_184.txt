<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; "warmly methodical" trait stated but not tested by cost during rope reconfiguration. Strong occupational specificity (archival tools), yet emotional calibration too pristine for temporal leap stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change with conceptual cost (entanglement with Croft). Causal lens holds: seal→research→rope manipulation directly triggers merge. Cost proof solid in final line’s implication of ongoing temporal consequences.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clock tower anchors early, but micro-setting (ceremonial rope) only partially constrains choices—it enables the merge yet faces no environmental pressure. Final golden light charges the image, yet tools/setting don’t alter tactics during critical reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early (vanishing warnings), but escalation lacks tangible tightening—Eleanor proceeds without hesitation despite "warnings." Agency strong, yet cost remains conceptual (no visceral friction during rope manipulation) despite closure’s implied entanglement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme ("translating confusion into clarity") emerges organically through archival actions and rope’s shifting patterns. Final image reweights premise: clarity brings new complexity with Croft’s arrival, avoiding moralizing. Subtle resonance in "fables as warnings" deepening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct archivist voice: tactile precision ("three strands intersecting at seven points") and controlled lexicon under pressure. "Warmly methodical" label repeats but perceptual signature (noticing seal impression, tool placement) remains consistent. No POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor scaffolding ("with her characteristically warmly methodical approach") and slight cliché ("hummed with energy"). Otherwise clean propulsion; final line’s "translating confusion into clarity" crystallizes theme without redundancy. No closure-beat artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival work with temporal mechanics; "fables of absence" transforms vanishing trope. Specificity (1782 research, seven braid points) grounds wonder. Emotional truth in academic obsession avoids safety middle, though risk-taking stays within genre bounds.</comment>
