<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "heart pounding" is label-only emotion without embodied specificity. Final transformation feels unearned as the poet faces no internal struggle against the ban's legacy—only pure yearning drives the choice, missing micro-choices that would reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a valid Charged Poise (thawing lake, "boundaries were thresholds"), with conceptual cost in lost years of truth. But causality falters: the humming colonnade's magic resolves the conflict it didn't create, and the "tremor of certainty" never faces tangible pressure, weakening escalation under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Cobalt stones and frozen lake create vivid atmosphere, but setting fails to constrain choices—the lake's "response" is magical rather than tactical. The quartz colonnade charges the final image (silent pillars transferring energy), yet no environment/tool actively shapes the poet's actions during the transformation beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes (artistic freedom vs. restriction) are clear early, but pressure never tightens meaningfully—the ban is already lifted, and transformation occurs frictionlessly through paraphrasing. Agency lacks trade-offs; the poet pays no visible price (e.g., physical cost or moral dilemma), making the conceptual cost feel abstract rather than dramatized on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the quartz-lake-shadow interplay, avoiding moralizing. The final image ("boundaries were not walls but thresholds") delivers a resonant Conceptual Repricing, reweighting the ban's cost as blocked sacred knowledge without stating a moral—though "sacred knowledge" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("cloud-shadow," "lantern-moth hush"), with rhythmic control deepening during the humming intensification. But "tremor of certainty" and "aesthetically driven" drift into thematic labels rather than embodied traits, slightly disrupting voice coherence under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is lush but contains paraphrase loops: "dissolving boundaries" repeats identically across beats, and "tremor of certainty" → "steady pulse" is semantic churn. Final line ("journey that would transform...") risks overwritten abstraction, though rhythm generally propels the scene without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Cloud-shadow poet" synthesizes fresh imagery with the ban's emotional weight, avoiding stock tropes. The quartz-lake symbiosis feels inevitable, but the frictionless transformation lacks bold risk—sacrificing specificity for lyric ease (e.g., no tangible cost during the dissolving act) limits higher-band ingenuity.</comment>
