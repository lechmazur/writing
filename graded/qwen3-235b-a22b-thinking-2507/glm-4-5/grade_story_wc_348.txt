<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (science vs emotion) drives choices, but "I need to atone" edges toward thematic echo. Embodied grief (kneeling, tracing foam) earns vulnerability, though sister's soft laugh slightly idealizes resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: river channels reconfigure relationship stakes with felt cost ("grief had loosened its grip"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density, though transition from observation to call lacks micro-tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Braided ravine actively constrains choice (foam patterns inspire polymer design) and charges final image. Micro-setting (chrysalis, river eddies) evolves from loss symbol to transformation, though terrain tactile details are sparse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: foam observation crystallizes trade-off between isolation and connection. Cost is legible in emotional shift ("grief loosened its grip") and vulnerable call, scaling perfectly to length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: river channels reprise as "parallel paths" without moralizing. Final image ("divergent paths that could still lead home") reweights premise with undeniable relational cost, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "symphonically minded" lens shapes river as "harmony," sister's laugh as "first note." Rhythmic control under pressure (crisp dialogue vs reflective prose), with patterned elision taught early through scientific observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "grief had transformed" abstraction, but propulsion remains strong. River foam motif slightly over-repeated; final line ("divergent paths that could still lead home") recharges motif with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of polymer science/river hydrology avoids tropes. Emotional specificity in "loosened grief" resists sentimentality. Risk-taking (scientific observation as emotional catalyst) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
