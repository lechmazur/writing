<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "meticulous focus on clock's inner workings" versus neglecting the whole; embodied emotion in "heat bled through fingertips" avoids therapy-speak. Townsfolk lack depth beyond functional helpers, slightly weakening relationship crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: repaired clock's ticking crystallizes "shared balance" with visible cost in Alaric's cracked voice shouting for help. Accumulative lens holds through inscription progression; storm backstory slightly retroactive but not disruptive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: obsidian ridge anchors opening/closing reflection, while pendulum bob's "smooth weight" versus rake handle's "rough texture" charges the climax. "Tidal" aspect remains decorative but doesn't undermine the tool-as-setting constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Alaric's agency reading inscriptions, narrowing options from solitary repair to communal action. Cost is unmistakable in "voice cracked with emotion," though "shared balance" stake signals late in the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: pendulum swinging "between extremes" mirrors community rhythm. Avoids moralizing via earned resonance in "we are all time-keepers" whisper; "incremental absolution" risks abstraction but saved by children polishing gears.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in clockmaker's tactile focus ("traced worn wood," "smooth weight"). Minor register drift in "ethically diligent" early on, but stress compresses diction effectively during the shout for help.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "pendulum bob glinted... incremental absolution wove" demonstrates triple-duty density. "Searing reverie" slightly purple but justified by context; final reflection image perfectly recharges the opening ridge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "repair community" trope through clockmaker specificity. Emotional truth in pride swallowed during shout elevates beyond template; "broken rake handle as wisdom vessel" feels fresh without gimmickry.</comment>
