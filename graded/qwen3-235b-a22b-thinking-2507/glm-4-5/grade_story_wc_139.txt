<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "mathematics of fair trade" dilemma; embodied fear-to-determination shift during safe opening avoids therapy-speak. Slight over-reliance on thematic abstraction ("greater truth") prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "breach trust of employer" crystallizes stakes. Causal chain holds perfectly through guard observation to stamping, but cost remains slightly abstract versus visceral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Funeral home prep room actively constrains choices (camera blind spots, refrigeration hum) and charges final image. "Deathly vitality" evolves from atmosphere to thematic engine without symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Maya's agency: observation narrows options to 2:17 AM window. Cost is unmistakable in "breach trust" line and final reflection, with asylum forms making moral calculus tangible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (forging forms as "resurrection"), avoiding moralizing. Final ink pot reflection reweights "honest path" without stating moral, though "greater truth" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct embalmer perceptual signature ("chemical scent of preservation fluids") and rhythmic control during heist ("heart raced but hands remained steady"). Zero register drift under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "patterns formed and reformed like liquid thoughts." Strategic telling compresses planning without losing momentum. Minor "mathematics" cliché redeemed by context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of funeral home setting with political asylum creates emotional specificity. Ink pot's "liquefying rigid thinking" transforms con artist trope through character-bound mechanics.</comment>
