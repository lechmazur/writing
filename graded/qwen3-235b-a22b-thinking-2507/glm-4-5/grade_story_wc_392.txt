<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "fortified vulnerability" manifesting in concrete micro-choices (photographing while recalling grandmother), though supervisor's off-page control lacks on-page friction to fully charge the career-risk payoff.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "scripted" whisper crystallizes systemic corruption with visible career cost, but drought timeframe's causal role in pressure escalation remains underdeveloped despite early anchoring.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tunnel setting constrains choice through water displacement analysis and lantern examination; the lantern itself charges the final image as both tool and symbol, though rain's impact feels slightly procedural rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Maya's agency uncovering evidence, but drought resolution serves only as body-discovery catalyst without active time pressure; career jeopardy feels earned yet lacks mid-scene tactical tradeoffs beyond evidence handling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through lantern's dual role in historical escape and present corruption, avoiding moralizing; "scripted" conclusion reweights systemic neglect without stating a thesis, though ancestral connection risks slight thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature evident in forensic detail prioritization ("water displacement levels inconsistent"), but "watchfully calm" repetition creates subtle voice convergence under pressure, diluting rhythmic control at climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong sensory specificity ("greenish patina," "damp earth") but paraphrase loops ("watchfully calm exterior/belied turmoil") and "reverberate" repetition dull peak-beat propulsion; final image remains clear despite minor scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of historical artifact with modern institutional critique feels inevitable; lantern's specific role in exposing tunnel neglect transforms trope, though drought framing lacks distinctive execution beyond functional setup.</comment>
