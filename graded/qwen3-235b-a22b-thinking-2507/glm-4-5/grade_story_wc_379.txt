<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in key beats; Leo's motivation remains consistently gentle without internal friction. Final endurance is earned but lacks visceral stakes escalation. Micro-choices under pressure are underdeveloped despite clean causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands flawlessly: Leo's abandonment of literal ownership ("never belonged to him but to everyone") reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds through textured storytelling beats. Single tightening (mailbox revelation) suffices for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vibrant courtyard descriptions are vivid but function as backdrop rather than constraint. "Sandstorm calm" tone doesn't actively shape choices or charge final image. Micro-setting (locket) charges closure but courtyard fails gate for 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (solving mystery → community connection) shifts organically with visible cost. Escalation lacks meaningful tightening; "outside world" threat introduced too late to compound pressure. One deepening (letters replacing valuables) reweights stakes effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: letters in mailbox embody "listening heals" without moralizing. Final image ("locket beside letters") reweights locket's meaning as communal artifact. Avoids thematic echo; cost is legible in Leo's reframed purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Consistent observational voice but lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure. Interiority filters everything through Leo's curator lens yet remains generically calm. No distinctive perceptual signature; dialogue exchanges lack character-specific idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Minor scaffold ("subtle thread of curiosity") and filter verbs ("he noticed how...") dull immediacy. Strong textural specificity in "wrinkled hands trembling" but isolated. No fatal loops; final image ("sanctuary where listening healed") avoids overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "mystery object" trope through specific emotional calculus (letters over valuables). Mrs. Henderson's key delivery feels inevitable. Avoids sentimentality via demolition notices as stakes amplifier. Freshness in closure's conceptual repricing.</comment>
