<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction underdeveloped; "dry-witted" trait stated but not demonstrated in choices. Final evidence-gathering lacks visible cost beyond professional skepticism, though indigenous wisdom integration deepens motivation credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: condensation reforming with "definitive source" crystallizes science/myth convergence with felt cost of isolation ("few would believe him"). Falcon convenience slightly undermines causality but doesn't break accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Condensation pattern functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (tracing tributaries) and charging final image. Frozen lake backdrop remains atmospheric rather than pressuring decisions, missing full 9+ gate eligibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through "worrying tranquility" motif but lack meaningful escalation; journey inland summarized without tactical narrowing. Cost (professional isolation) legible but pressure doesn't tighten under accumulative lens as required for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Rivers begin with intention" avoids thematic echo by staying earned through discovery. Final image ("why humanity needs to seek origins") resonates non-literally without moralizing, embracing complexity of scientific/indigenous synthesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct cartographic voice shines: "tracing condensation," "mathematics alone could never reveal." Repetition of "worrying tranquility" intentionally modulates with pressure. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts purposefully at climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("worrying tranquility" verbatim repeat) and stock phrase ("methodical grace") slightly dull momentum. High density maintained, but filter-verb stack ("watched," "wondering," "moved") in falcon scene triggers -0.3 artifact penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Singular convergence" transforms familiar trope through specific hydrological/indigenous synthesis. Condensation motif irreplaceable, but "scientist validates native wisdom" framework lacks bold risk; emotional truth compensates with cartographic precision.</comment>
