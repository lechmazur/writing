<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through tactile tracing of pockmarks revealing contradictory impulses (mending vs. accepting brokenness), but "kintsugi intentions" phrasing edges toward label-speak without sufficient embodied cost in that beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when Marcel realizes uncertainty was "necessary preparation," with undeniable conceptual cost in "golden joining of fragments" reconfiguring his stance under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The key ring charm (tool) charges the final image by pulsing "sympathetically" during revelation, constraining Marcel's emotional progression while the acid sea setting pressures his physical isolation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Marcel's agency—tracing pockmarks transforms "fractured consciousness" into reverence, with felt cost in accepting brokenness rather than seeking perfection as options narrow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the statue's pockmarks becoming "golden joining," avoiding moralizing while reweighting Marcel's journey as necessary mending rather than repair.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature in alchemical lexicon ("transmutation," "kintsugi") and rhythmic control under pressure, though minor POV leakage in "dire enchantment" attribution slightly disrupts focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose soars with concrete specificity ("weathered fingertips that had known the burn of alchemical fire"), but "fractured tapestry of his existence" risks scaffold phrasing in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of alchemy and kintsugi avoids tropes through Marcel's tactile ritual, though the acid sea setting leans slightly toward familiar speculative fiction backdrops without full transformation.</comment>
