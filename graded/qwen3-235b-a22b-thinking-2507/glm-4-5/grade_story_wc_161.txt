<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shines via embodied details ("tracing invisible paths," "songs stirring within") but pigeon loss backstory lacks specific dramatization; contradictory impulses (abandonment vs. rediscovery) remain summary-driven rather than active in-scene choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (pigeon release crystallizing balance) with conceptual cost (meteorite as cosmic counterweight), but Accumulative lens wobbles—dust-mote "heartbeat" mapping lacks causal setup, weakening escalation's pressure coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Attic micro-setting excels: dust motes under skylight constrain choices (predicting thoughts), and paper trails charge the final image. Yet vintage bookshop remains postcard backdrop—no resource pressure (e.g., ink scarcity) altering tactics despite the setting's potential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving lost songs) is clear early, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—meteorite "calls her name," dust motes "shift according to heartbeat." Cost (abandoned identity) is felt yet not shown altering tactics; "learning to trust" remains abstract without concrete tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through paper trails → flight paths, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("wings catching light like paper trails") reweights loss as renewal without stating a moral, though "songs echoing once more" skirts thematic echo but avoids explicit sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("aging paper bloomed in her senses even as it withered memories") with rhythmic control—lyric compression taught early pays off in closure. Zero head-hopping; voice modulates perfectly from decay ("slow decay") to renewal ("signature blooming with new life").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; high density ("rumpled parchment/vintage bookshop attic" anchors voice). Minor overwriting risk in "extraterrestrial mysteries that seemed to call her name" but motif payoff justifies it. Final image's "ancient blue" avoids purple prose through earned specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis: meteorite as paperweight creating cosmic paper trails transforms pigeon courier trope. Bold risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes, but "lost songs" motivation edges toward familiar territory without sufficient unique emotional calculus.</comment>
