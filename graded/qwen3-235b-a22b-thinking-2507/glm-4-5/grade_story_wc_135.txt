<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion ("tears of joy and sorrow") but lacks contradictory impulses; protagonist remains passive observer rather than making micro-choices under pressure, weakening causality of her transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with conceptual cost in "home, at last, was not just a place," but minor causality gap: visions arrive "precisely when needed" without Elina's active pursuit narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ivory harbor's "absences" evolve from painful emptiness to "presence," charging the final image; ocean-spray functions as micro-setting constraining her archival work through tactile details like "water-stained diary."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulated fragments (trumpet, diary) reweighting exile's meaning, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—Elina receives revelations rather than actively pursuing them under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "navigated absences" metaphor, but final paragraph's "showing them that their experiences... were not endings" edges toward thematic echo, slightly diminishing earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("glistening stones reflected returning sunlight") with rhythmic control; pressure modulates voice from reflective ("staggered intervals") to crystalline closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>No closure-dulling artifacts, but verbatim repetition of "Through staggered intervals" creates a paraphrase loop; otherwise exemplary density ("pristine but painful emptiness" compresses theme and setting).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival work as healing ritual, but "ivory harbor" metaphor risks familiar exile-trope; specificity of "ocean-spray archivist" elevates through lived detail without gimmickry.</comment>
