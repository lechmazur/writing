<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (power vs ethics) surfaces late; pivotal choice lacks micro-struggles showing hesitation. Strength: embodied warmth of lens, but "thaw mistrust" motivation undercooked before climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Earned Stasis with conceptual cost (relinquishing power for trust), validated by peaceful murmurs at dawn. Weakness: hidden chamber discovery leans coincidental, slightly undermining agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting charges final image ("crystal whispering forecourt after rain became a symbol") and constrains action via rain's melody. Misses higher band: doesn't actively pressure mid-scene choices (e.g., lens could be found anywhere).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through agency-driven ticket discoveries toward ethical choice. Cost legible in "responsibility... not to invade privacy," but "self-imposed prisons of silence" keeps stakes abstract until late.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly through particulars: "cryptic doodles" evolving into shared language, silence transforming from barrier to connection. Final image ("comfortable silence between people who truly understood") is a resonant, non-literal answer avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("footsteps echoing softly," "lingering notes of music") with rhythmic control. Minor flaw: filter verbs ("she realized") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats like chamber discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with clear propulsion; "tales of love, betrayal, hope, and regret" avoids listiness through concrete verbs. Weakness: "cryptic doodles" repetition (4x) creates subtle paraphrase loop without added pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-verbal honesty via visual doodles, projector as ethical tool. Transformation test passed—swap "lens" for generic "magic object" breaks mechanics. Risk-taking (quiet climax) heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
