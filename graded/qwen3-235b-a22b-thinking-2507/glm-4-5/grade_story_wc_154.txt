<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak; "smudged notes" reveal contradictory hope through embodied micro-choices. "Shrewdly innocent" trait remains label-heavy without sufficient action constraint.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost: coral handover crystallizes Lina's smudged hope ("Daddy always comes...") amid irreversible loss. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through coral/smudge motifs with one deepening beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Brain coral constrains choice (Lina's fear-unknotting ritual) and charges final image. Mist-atmosphere pressures action (fading light obscuring cast notes), avoiding white-room syndrome through tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Kaelen's micro-choice to reinterpret smudged notes, narrowing options from uncertainty to fragile hope. Cost (irreversible paternal absence) legible in blurred "Daddy always comes..." line but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through coral/smudge motifs without moralizing; final image ("stitch in fabric of healing") reweights loss through concrete action. Avoids thematic echo but secondary "shared anxieties" concept remains abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shrewdly innocent" translator seeing ritual in coral tracing) modulates under pressure. Minor register drift in "lotus-hearted ache" slightly disrupts voice consistency during peak tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with dual-purpose lines ("anesthetic still smoothing her brow" implying medical/psychic state) but "lotus-hearted ache" is stock phrasing in high-pressure beat. Zero loops; final line recharges coral motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of translator-as-healer trope through tactile object work (coral/smudged notes). Avoids derivative safety by rooting war trauma in child's cast rather than battlefield clichés.</comment>
