<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "rationally rebellious" paradox; embodied choice of pocketing the cog over shouting earns closure. Minor deduction for near-therapeutic "agonize" phrasing in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "true chronometer of human knowledge continued its silent turning" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through sedimentary pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sedimentary layers function as micro-setting that charges closure; murky waters shifting overnight constrain movement. Cog's patina and teeth embody thematic weight without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Milo's tactile engagement with the cog, narrowing options to preservation vs destruction. Cost felt in "collective forgetting" but lacks visceral forfeiture; escalation driven by artifact discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through cog's reprise: final image answers "competing narratives" with "silent turning" avoiding moralizing. Near-miss in "what was wisdom if not..." skirts thematic echo but stays character-bound.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "sedimentary layers of evidence"; syntax mirrors Milo's precision ("meticulously crafted by hands long dead"). No head-hopping; pressure compresses diction without rupture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "patina of time" shows textural specificity. Minor deduction for "rationally rebellious" as near-label in high-pressure beat, but cadence remains clean through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</comment>Transforms philosopher-in-sewers trope through sedimentary methodology; "abrasive calm" redefines rebellion as preservation. Fresh synthesis in chronometer as "question posed across centuries" with emotional specificity.</comment>
