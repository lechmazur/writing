<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in numbness vs. seeking vibrational connection is embodied through drum-rim tracing and silent dance; micro-choices with needle secure motivation but drum maker’s shift lacks friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stakes through the backward-spinning record’s "symphony of silence"; cost legible in "life without volume, but full of meaning" though drum maker’s conversion slightly softens tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Drum maker’s cavern functions as micro-setting where stone floor vibrations constrain choice; "broken phonograph needle" charges final image but seasonal rustle remains decorative rather than pressure-driving.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through backward-record experiments narrowing Eleanor’s path from solitary solace to shared teaching; cost felt in "rebirth" but drum maker’s skepticism resolves without sufficient friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tactile reconfiguration: "filament of hush" shifts from numbness antidote to communal language without moralizing; final image answers central question through vibration’s "profound language".</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in vibration-focused sensory hierarchy ("fingertips remembering rhythms"); rhythmic control falters slightly in repetitive "filament of hush" phrasing during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose excels in textural specificity ("fractured needle," "stone floor vibrations") but minor scaffold appears in adjacent "faint rustle of turning seasons" repetitions dulling momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ingenuity in transforming deafness into vibrational pedagogy feels inevitable; "backward songs" premise avoids cliché through drum maker’s instrument-crafting response though seasonal framing lacks freshness.</comment>
