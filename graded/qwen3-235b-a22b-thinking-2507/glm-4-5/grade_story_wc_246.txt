<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("confidently uncertain") drives action; embodied emotion in pen glow moment; regret-to-wisdom arc earned through specific causal chain of error-correction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: "tending the garden" crystallizes stance with felt cost of ongoing responsibility; Accumulative lens holds through density shift in chronopaper scene; moonlight applause motif pays off orientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gravitational anomaly actively pressures choices (distorting moonlight during writing); dried pen constrains tactics as micro-setting; sensory details filtered through interpreter's bias ("cosmic murmurs," spectral data).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (correcting professional error) tightens via pen's "suggestion"; cost legible in "tending the garden" endurance; agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens through chronopaper writing sequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pen metaphor ("history written in pen, not stone"); final image reweights "confidently uncertain" as strength without moralizing; ambiguity in "twisted ribbons" of time avoids tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in cosmic lexicon ("quantum oscillators," "spectral data"); rhythmic control peaks during chronopaper scene; zero POV slippage despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Minor synonym churn ("mysterious yet intimate, terrifying yet welcoming"); otherwise clean propulsion; final line’s "cradled her in its strange comfort" achieves textural specificity without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms time-editing trope via "contingent relationships" mechanic; emotional specificity in guilt-turned-determination; risk-taking in quiet Charged Poise closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
