<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in Elias' calm exterior versus revolutionary urgency, embodied through tactile details like the warm quill holder; micro-choices during sundial painting reveal hierarchy of values. Lacks deeper contradictory impulses beyond surface tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: completed sundial message crystallizes options with undeniable pressure as "embers began to glow," the warm quill holder making cost legible. Accumulative lens holds cohesively through blackout's density increase.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bronze quill holder functions as micro-setting that charges the final image ("rested against his heart, a tiny vessel of transformation"), constraining choices during sundial painting. Bioluminescent walls' evolution from "flickering nervously" to full luminance subtly mirrors internal stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Revolutionary stakes tighten meaningfully under Accumulative lens: blackout compresses options, forcing encoded communication. Cost is legible in Elias' "warm weight" awareness, though moral calculus lacks deeper complexity beyond "ideas over weapons" dichotomy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through coded angles and silent revolution imagery, avoiding moralizing. Final image of glowing embers offers resonant answer to "cradle of sparks" without stating a moral, though thematic depth remains slightly surface-level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "language of angles" observations and tactile focus; rhythmic control shifts effectively from measured strokes to urgent whispers. Minor register drift in "cradle of sparks" phrasing slightly disrupts voice under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with clean propulsion, though "cradle of sparks needed only the right whisper" exhibits slight overwriting. Zero loops or scaffold; final line's "potent vessel of transformation" achieves crystalline closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Specific synthesis of revolution-through-art feels fresh and inevitable, with bronze quill holder transforming trope into organic device. Avoids abstraction through concrete stakes, though safety-middle hedging in "ideas over weapons" reduces risk-taking impact.</comment>
