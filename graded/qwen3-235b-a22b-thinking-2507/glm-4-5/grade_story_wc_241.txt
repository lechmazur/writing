<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in math vs gambling duality, but final "peace" lacks embodied cost; micro-choices like tracing mica pane reveal values without sufficient struggle against fatalism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with Fibonacci discovery deepening perspective, but "something like peace" fails cost proof test; no exact sentence makes conceptual cost legible at closure despite strong Charged Poise setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Candle lantern functions as micro-setting—constrains choice when she copies sequences under its light and charges final image; "rainwashed" specificity elevates beyond postcard description through tactile integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via subway discoveries escalating pressure, but cost remains abstract; "clover melancholy" implies loss yet lacks visible price on tactics—Elena's journey shifts perspective without altering her methods.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing while "beautiful uncertainty" reweights math as theme; final image answers central question non-literally through "space between certainties," though "reconcile lucid contradictions" borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in math-filtered observations ("numbers dance differently"); rhythmic control under pressure with "cardiac interruption" lexicon fitting academic POV without jarring register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "transforming every moment into one of those lucid contradictions" slightly dulls momentum; no figurative muddle but "clover melancholy" repetition edges toward thematic loop in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms gambler trope through mathematical lens—Moscow subway graffiti as "language of hope" synthesizes probability with human connection; avoids safety middle via flawed yet specific reconciliation of fatalism and theory.</comment>
