<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation (“genuine desire to find forgotten combinations”) lacks interior contradiction; “latent blaze” is vague label-only emotion. No micro-choices under pressure—she executes plans flawlessly, missing the 9+ requirement for contradictory impulses in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with conceptual cost (generational vigilance burden), but the final “weight of renewed responsibility” is abstract. Fails cost proof test—no exact on-page image/sentence making cost legible at closure beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Serpentine grotto actively constrains choices (time pressure, rune navigation), and mist charges the final image (“taste still on lips”). Meets 9+ gate as micro-setting that shapes tactics and closure, though “clandestinely luminous” leans generic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieve seeds before gravity resets) escalates via live clock (60→7 mins), driving agency under causal lens. But no visible price paid during attempts—everything works perfectly, missing the band guardrail for 8.8+ requiring a felt price altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (“eternal cycle of vigilance”) emerges through action, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights the premise, but “latent blaze” pseudo-profundity dilutes resonance. No thematic echo, yet abstraction weakens the 9+ quick test for non-literal closure answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature (“prism-mind,” serpentine imagery) with rhythmic control (“lukewarm liquid enveloped her”). “Latent blaze” repetition creates a tic, but voice remains consistent under pressure—no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density with clean propulsion, but “latent blaze” appears 4x as label-only emotion (e.g., “burned within her”), and “clandestinely luminous” overuse borders on overwriting. No loops, yet figurative muddle in peak beats prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh gravity-inversion mechanic and archivist-as-protagonist elevate tropes, but “seeds of vigilance” feels generic. Risk-taking (prism-perception) heightens stakes, yet emotional specificity lacks the 9+ requirement for a non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable.</comment>
