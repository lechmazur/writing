<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices (glasses removal hiding tremors) and "jagged edges" dialogue. Beatrice's ethereal grit voice reveals status dynamics, though forgiveness feels slightly accelerated without sufficient prior friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: orchard tremors force Beatrice's fade while the incomplete sheet music crystallizes reconciliation's cost. Accumulative lens holds with scent-release-to-connection density increase, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perfume bottle as micro-setting constrains ritual precision and charges the final image ("sealing away imperfect miracles"). Orchards' destruction pressure tightens tactics, satisfying 9+ gate through tool-driven constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Beatrice's layered forgiveness ("not because it heals everything"), with orchard tremors creating live-clock pressure. Cost legible in Eloise's tears and the music fragment's incompleteness under Accumulative escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: "shattered sandals" metaphor evolves into the sheet music fragment, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "imperfect miracles" as resonant, non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("melodies slept dormant in paper coffins") modulates with pressure. Compression taught early ("Time tiptoes on broken glass") pays off in climax without scaffold; psychic distance shifts intentionally during connection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fingers merged like mist" avoids figurative muddle in peak beat. Minor deduction for "unsaid words and unshed tears" bordering cliché, but saved by contextual specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Gossip-column exorcist" transforms tropes through copper-wire rituals and perfume-as-spirit-key. Emotional truth in imperfect reconciliation avoids neat resolution, with orchard destruction as fresh pressure integration.</comment>
