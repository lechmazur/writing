<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation burns bright but interior contradiction lacks; "feeling sculptor's hands as her own" edges toward over-articulated empathy without counterweighting resistance to the emotional flood.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: renewed purpose to "give rediscovered music new form" carries visible cost in tear-traced prisms; Accumulative lens holds through emotional layering without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Siskin alder grove constrains via fog-muted light affecting sculpture analysis and silence enabling her craft; "weak sun filtering through canopy" directly shapes her work conditions and final charged image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore music) tightens through strumming’s emotional deluge; cost legible in tears altering her physical state, but escalation lacks meaningful trade-off beyond absorption—no sacrificed resource or altered tactic beyond resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>Theme emerges organically from "stress cracks as notes" metaphor; final image of "work of redemption began anew" reweights music-as-redemption without moralizing, though "whispered melodies" edges toward sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "hearing potential harmonies in rustling leaves" filters all description; rhythmic control shifts from lyrical dawn to staccato strumming under pressure with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop in sculpture description ("statue stood half-swallowed... roots embracing"); otherwise clean propulsion with "prisms of sound" metaphor avoiding purple prose through voice consistency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of music archaeology and ecological grief; "stress cracks as musical notation" transforms trope through specific wood-memory mechanics, though hedgehog motif risks ornamental symbolism.</comment>
