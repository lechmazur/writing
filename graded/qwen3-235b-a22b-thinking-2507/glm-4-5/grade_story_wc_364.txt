<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (meekness vs determination) shown through concrete micro-choices like hesitating with silk yet wrapping it deliberately. Final trade feels earned by prior causality, though "quiet defiance" edges toward abstraction without full embodiment under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("surge of azure energy... cold and burning") and reconfigured meaning. Causal lens holds firmly: silk discovery → trade → arch repair. Minor compression in "first days after" transition slightly dulls escalation momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mine shafts function as micro-setting that constrains choices (workshop location) and charges closure ("echo of his determination"). Floating arches actively pressure the conflict, though orchard details remain decorative rather than tactical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (transforming brokenness) tightens meaningfully when elders present fractured arches. Orion's agency drives escalation ("accepted the challenge quietly"), with visible cost (traded silence/essence) legible in the trade's physical sensation and final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "forge strength from shards" reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image crystallizes resilience as active repair rather than avoidance, avoiding thematic echo while resonating with prior rubble-to-fortification transformations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("calloused fingers," "dripping water") modulates under pressure. Minor abstraction ("quiet authority") dilutes immediacy during high-stakes moments, though rhythmic control in closure beats ("whisper of blue silk against steel") compensates.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong propulsion but paraphrase loops ("movements imbued with purpose... hands moved with purpose") and redundant "azure defiance" repetitions dull high-pressure beats. No artifacts touch closure, but scaffold reduces density in middle section.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "chosen one" trope through specific barter mechanics (silk demanding essence) and planetary logic. Fresh synthesis of resilience-as-repair feels inevitable, though floating arches lack deeper world integration beyond visual novelty.</comment>
