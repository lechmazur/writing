<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "blood called from chromatic memories" but "visceral moments" borders on label-speak; grandfather's gaze creates embodied stakes yet flaws lack concrete manifestation beyond solemnity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "wounds that still bled beneath the skin of progress" crystallizes the theme; Accumulative lens holds through debris-to-answer transformation without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon constrains every pivotal choice—from detour request to message arrangement—and charges the final image with violet transformation; micro-setting of volcanic glass directly shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Ellara's agency: archival curiosity escalates to beach debris parley, narrowing options to temporal dialogue; "wounds that still bled" makes conceptual cost legible under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (beach debris messages) not moralizing; final image of "making history" reweights "truth in tension" without stating morals, avoiding thematic echo despite prompt-like central phrase.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "encrypted diary spines" and "chromatic memories" modulates under stress; minor register drift in "retrocognitively trapped" but rhythmic control sustains pressure through lagoon payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Searing reverie" repetition creates subtle synonym churn; otherwise high density with propulsion—"beach debris rearranged itself into answers" crystallizes tension without muddle, though debris description edges toward scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synthesizes time-travel trope through civil rights lens with specific obsidian lagoon mechanics; avoids middle-ground hedging via bold beach debris method that heightens stakes coherently to closure.</comment>
