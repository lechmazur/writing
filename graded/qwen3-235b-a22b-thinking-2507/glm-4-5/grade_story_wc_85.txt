<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (deception vs truth-seeking) act simultaneously in the climax; embodied regret in "tears traced paths washing away layers of deception" avoids therapy-speak. Slight motivation gap: grandfather's erasure reason lacks visceral causality despite strong interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost: paired objects in sand crystallize stance shift. Orientation anchors by line 3 ("cobalt terrace at dusk"). Hybrid lens (Accumulative dominant) holds through "sieved hush" density building to recognition beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Driftwood carvings function as micro-setting that constrains choice (distinguishing workmanship) and charges closure. "Cobalt terrace" remains decorative; moonlight on carving is the essential tactile constraint shaping the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Martin's agency: searching "not to deceive but to find real" tightens stakes. Cost is unmistakable in "tears washing away layers of deception" and business closure decision. Pressure coheres through Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (paired objects in sand), avoiding moralizing. Final line reframes inheritance as acknowledgment without stating moral. "Unconditional love" realization reweights prior deception with emotional cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "sieved hush" reframing twilight; rhythm modulates with pressure ("recognition struck him with tempered regret"). One filter verb ("he remembered") in high-stakes beat slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops in closure beat but adjacent synonym churn: "weight of unspoken words pressed" then "weight of withheld truth tormented." Final image ("lightness within tempered regret could not diminish") achieves high density without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: genealogist crafting driftwood memories transforms "family secret" trope. Emotional specificity in grandfather's initials elevates beyond cliché. "Cobalt terrace" verges on overwrought but compensated by concrete carving mechanics.</comment>
