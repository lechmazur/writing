<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("drawn and terrified") and embodied choices during climb feel authentic; counselors' fear lacks specific motivation beyond vague "awaken," slightly weakening causality for her choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost ("disenchantment transforming into purpose"); lens is clearly Causal ("because dreams called, she climbed, revealing true self") with no ambiguity at midpoint or closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Razor-sharp rocks constrain climbing tactics; cobalt grotto's "lacy menace" charges final image reprise. Fireflies ritual lacks causal pressure but micro-setting (climbing gear) shapes ascent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize when pool reflection reveals unburdened self—foreclosing old identity with felt cost ("years of royal burdens"). Agency drives escalation; bleeding starlight directly alters her power and understanding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through grotto's reweighted "lacy menace" becoming "promise," avoiding moralizing. Final line’s "rediscovery of a self" risks thematic echo but remains image-driven.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("gilded cage," "ghostly precision" moonlight); "weary determination" is stock phrasing. Consistent single POV with rhythmic control during ascent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor scaffold: "dressed in practical climbing gear beneath her cloak" redundantly follows "slipped out... in climbing gear." Final image achieves crystalline clarity with zero loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "quest for self" trope via bleeding starlight/sapphire pool specifics; avoids generic fantasy through tactile details ("fingers finding purchase on razor-sharp rocks").</comment>
