<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in fever-blurred reality/revelation tension; embodied "lead in stomach" avoids label-speak. Final choice earned by systematic margin work, but micro-choices lack sufficient irrationality during high-stakes smudging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: auroras amplify "sorrow he now carries as both burden and purpose." Accumulative lens holds perfectly—patterned margin work tightens options to one crystallized path with felt weight. No flaws touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mountain station constrains every choice: altitude enables prophecy, snow on floor signals vulnerability, compromised window permits snow intrusion. Micro-setting (botanical illustration) charges final image—altered drawing packed with "mechanical precision" embodies the cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through agency: smudging margins narrows options to one coordinates-driven path. "Lead in stomach" physicalizes cost early; auroral sorrow’s weight charges the finale. Minor dip in escalation depth—fever’s role in swallowing truth remains slightly opaque.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment><comment>"Swaying certainties" theme emerges through Alexandrae’s "weightless uncertainty" and auroral tears—no moralizing. Final image reweights premise: meteoric fragment is "impossibly light and heavy as mountains," answering the central question without abstraction. Lacks one resonant counter-reading.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature dominates: "peripheral awareness" shapes noticing smudges and auroras. Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure—fever delirium’s fragmented syntax vs. methodical margin work. Slight register drift in "quantum-like unpredictability" risks POV lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "snow blown through compromised window seal" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor figurative muddle: "crystallized fragment... pulsed with auroral sorrow" slightly strains physics logic. Final line’s cadence shift ("impossibly light and heavy as mountains") delivers propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Fault-tolerant oracle" transforms prophecy tropes through scientific precision; "auroral sorrow" as celestial tears feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking (margins as method) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passed—replace "metaphysicist" with generic seer breaks causal logic.</comment>
