<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; "bruised awe" diagnostic label in final paragraph triggers -0.4 deduction despite strong embodied emotion in ocean hues and calloused hands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lens ambiguity early (Situational/Accumulative) resolved by midpoint; Earned Stasis closure valid with legible cost ("exhausted but resolute"), but lens inconsistency prevents 9.0+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the crack's evolution from "burden" to "quiet engine" constrains ritual method and charges final image with captured starlight; "bruised" hues mirror emotional state without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation deepens through density (starlight dimming/shadows writhing) not agency; cost legible in exhaustion but pressure lacks causal linkage to Elias's choices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: "fragile, defiant song" reweights oblivion without moralizing; final whisper-echo answers central question with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bruised purple/orange hues") with rhythmic control; "pane of hush" repetition teaches pattern early, avoiding monotony during high-pressure ritual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion but "beautifully flawed" paraphrase loop (3x near climax) prevents 10.0; final line's cadence ("nested patterns... vast unknown") exemplifies strategic density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tropes: brokenness as salvation mechanism ("crack spidering from missing eye"); risk distinction +0.3 for Accumulative structure sustaining tension without gimmickry.</comment>
