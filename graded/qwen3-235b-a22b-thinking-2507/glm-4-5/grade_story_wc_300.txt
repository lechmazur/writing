<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation crystallizes abruptly without internal conflict; embodied warmth of pearl ("liquid sunlight") shows specificity but lacks contradictory impulses before transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully with social cost ("state of disconnection"), but early disorientation about inspector's role slightly weakens causal anchoring despite eventual clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal caves function as micro-setting that constrains choice (silence forcing listening) and charges final image ("abandoned hopes clinging like shadows"), meeting 9+ gate requirement decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (healing isolation) tightens through pearl's absorption mechanic, but cost ("weight" of invisible crown) remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt during the critical transformation beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically until final paragraph's prompt-like moralizing ("state of disconnection that could be healed, if only..."), triggering Thematic Echo penalty that undermines earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("calcium carbonate confessions," "resonant hush") modulates beautifully, but stress-induced compression falters during crown transformation where lyrical uniformity dulls urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops with high density, but "heartbeat" repetition creates minor cadence echo; "latent radiance" overuse in peak beats slightly muddles figurative clarity despite strong propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bunker inspector trope with seashell confessions in calcium carbonate avoids cliché, though "cultivated pearl" risks magical realism familiarity without the seashell's transformative specificity.</comment>
