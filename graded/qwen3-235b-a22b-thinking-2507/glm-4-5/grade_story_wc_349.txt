<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation ("find where stories begin") is clear but abstract; lacks embodied contradiction or flawed micro-choices under pressure. Epiphany feels unearned as no visible struggle precedes "finally understanding," bordering on diagnostic label-speak despite poetic phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: vendor's crystallization of "where stories become possible" reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost (century of confinement, parole conditions). Accumulative lens holds—pressure tightens through moonlight/shard density until the door's creation, with parole renewal making cost undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Glass orchard library floats vividly but functions as passive backdrop; no environmental constraint on choices (e.g., cloud sea doesn't impede action). Bottled moonlight serves as micro-setting that charges the ending via shard reassembly, narrowly clearing the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding story origins) lacks escalation—pressure diffuses rather than intensifies during the lull. Agency in door-creation is earned, but cost remains retrospective (parole terms) rather than dramatized in-scene consequence, weakening escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "quantifying absence" reframes emptiness as story-essence through concrete action (shard reassembly). Final image ("bottled moonlight illuminated their smile") resonates without moralizing, reweighting "spaces between spoken/unspoken" as earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("glass birds nested... containing unvoiced wishes") and rhythmic control elevate tension. Voice modulates perfectly from serene ("gentle shadows") to charged ("pressed the shards together"), with patterned elision (parole backstory) taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("crystalline fruits pulsed with captured narratives") propels momentum. Figurative language ("humming with forgotten promises") deepens stakes without muddle, even in peak beats like door-creation. Final "Sh" fragment is purposeful, taught by "lull" motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "bottled moonlight" as quantified absence transforms storytelling tropes. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes coherently—glass orchard isn't whimsy but parole-mandated constraint. Emotional truth in vendor's quiet epiphany avoids abstraction.</comment>
