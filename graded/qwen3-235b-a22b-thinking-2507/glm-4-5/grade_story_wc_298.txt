<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Therapy-speak ("patch holes in the soul") triggers -0.4 penalty; emotional progression feels tidied despite strong embodied choices like tracing symbols during memory trammeling. Contradictory impulses (recklessness/patience) lack friction in climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with visible cost ("her sacrifice" absorbing pain), but escalation under Accumulative lens lacks meaningful density increase—the memory confrontation resolves too neatly without deepening the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment actively constrains choices: roots-between-bones setting forces tactile navigation where "light failed," and the tarot card's carbonized surface charges the final image by absorbing sorrow. Micro-setting precision elevates beyond atmospheric decoration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes (containing escaped sorrow) tighten via temperature drop and memory's resistance, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven deepening; the "desperate shudder" resolution feels coincidental rather than earned through Elara's tactics under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through charred tarot patterns and life-death cycles; final image of "fiercely gentle, recklessly hopeful" vigil reweights renewal without moralizing. Avoids Thematic Echo but "patch holes" phrasing borders on abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust motes dancing in dim light") and rhythmic control shine, though "feathers of resolve rustled internally" creates a mixed metaphor that momentarily disrupts voice coherence during peak tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Scaffold penalty (-0.3) for synonym loops ("life from death, death sustaining life"); otherwise strong propulsion. Filter-verbs ("she believed," "she saw") dilute immediacy but avoid closure-touched artifacts, keeping density high in pivotal beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis in catacomb orchard ecology and "trammel" as mending action, though "reckless idealist" trait leans tropey. Emotional specificity in bartered destiny avoids generic sacrifice, but risk-taking doesn’t fully heighten stakes beyond atmospheric novelty.</comment>
