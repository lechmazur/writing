<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (ancient/vulnerable) strong early, but final realization "independence had been waiting within her" edges toward unearned thematic echo without sufficient embodied cost in the climax beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with density increase in "brittle awakenings," but cost proof fails—mosaic coalescence lacks pinpoint legibility of sacrifice; Earned Stasis valid yet conceptual cost remains slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atomically reflective wall charges closure via tactile integration ("hand against... feeling its perfect smoothness"), but tidal library remains atmospheric backdrop without constraining choices or altering tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through awakening fragility, yet escalation lacks agency-driven deepening; resolution relies on internal realization rather than choices that visibly alter tactics or pay concrete price during coexistence method.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through mosaics "filled with golden light of acceptance," but final line stating independence "waiting within her" risks thematic echo, narrowly avoiding penalty through earned resonance with stone circle hum.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shadows lengthening according to cosmic rhythm she alone understood") sustains Accumulative lens, though "method of coexistence revealed itself" drifts into clinical register during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold, but "brittle fragments... began to coalesce, no longer fragile pieces but mosaics" contains paraphrase redundancy; figurative language stays precise yet slightly overwrought in high-stakes awakening sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal library and atomically reflective surfaces elevates "last of extinct species" trope, though resolution’s "independence within her" leans familiar; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
