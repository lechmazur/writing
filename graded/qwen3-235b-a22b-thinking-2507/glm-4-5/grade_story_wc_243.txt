<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses; archivist's resolve is consistent but not tested by internal conflict. Motivation crystallizes cleanly yet avoids wrestling with competing desires beyond abstract acceptance of change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost: "increasingly blurred vision" and "impossible to hold onto permanently" crystallize the weight of preservation. Accumulative lens holds as sensory density reweights obsolescence into continuity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Jetty constrains choices: wildflowers become ink ingredients, twilight-to-night transition mirrors his transformation. Final image charges setting as "refuge, laboratory, church," meeting 9+ gate via environmental constraint on closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through archivist's ritual (mixing ink, final drawing), but external pressure (archive closure) lacks active resistance. Cost is felt yet not tested by meaningful tactical trade-offs under time pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "weight of small moments" gains resonance through walnut-ink process and jetty flowers. Final line "gently thorough until the very end" reweights premise without moralizing, avoiding Thematic Echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in archivist's observational bias ("saw patterns where others saw chaos"), but filter verbs ("knowledge filled him") dilute immediacy. Rhythmic control wavers during reflection beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loop in "through proximate causes" (three repetitions) and near-cliché "petals trembling" trigger -0.4. Figurative language remains coherent but lacks propulsion in high-pressure beats like the final drawing.</comment>
<question>8</question><question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archivist-as-artisan with "regenerated covenant" ritual, yet "haunted euphoria" feels familiar. Jetty flowers as ink ingredients transform preservation tropes through specific, verifiable detail.</comment>
