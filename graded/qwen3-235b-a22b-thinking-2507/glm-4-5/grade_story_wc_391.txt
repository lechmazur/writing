<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (vigilante patience) drives action; embodied tension in fogged glass and listening to ice cracks. But "sculpting patience" remains abstract without community impatience dramatized on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (humming viaduct confirming theories) reconfigures stakes with felt cost of lifelong dedication. Dawn paragraph diffuses tension slightly with "satisfaction" before final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen lake constrains every action (reflection path, cracking sounds, thawing edges) and charges final image. Basalt sanctuary's wind melodies directly shape the mapper's tools and emotional state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes (burden of haste) signaled early but remain abstract; pressure escalates through magnetic resonance. Lacks concrete demonstration of impatience's cost to villagers beyond generalization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through moon path tracking and magnetic alignment, not moralizing. Final "patience as humanity's greatest achievement" borders on stated moral despite thawing lake image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("restrained wildness" as rhythmic anchor) persists under pressure. Oil lamp's "dancing flame" and ice cracks embody tension without filter verbs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose flows with purposeful variation until "restrained wildness" repetition in final paragraph creates thematic echo scaffold. "Satisfaction" weakens closure's propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "patient revolution" trope through magnetic viaduct mechanics and basalt acoustics. Avoids safety middle with quiet revolution premise but "sculpting patience" phrasing feels familiar.</comment>
