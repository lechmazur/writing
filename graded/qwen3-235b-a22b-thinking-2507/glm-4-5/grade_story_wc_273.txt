<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "serene anger" modulating to awe during temporal displacement, with embodied cost in vital fluctuations. Childhood trauma motivation deepens via ink experiment’s physical risk, though "profound understanding" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: vitals display proves physical toll while "Time doesn’t slow—we change our relationship" crystallizes the thematic shift. Accumulative lens holds through ink pattern density without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Wind-carved encampment actively constrains choices (eclipse timing, temporal magnification), while disappearing ink as micro-setting directly charges the climax’s dissolution. Final rain scent reweights time’s fluidity without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (crisis-time relationship) escalates through the ink experiment’s physical danger, narrowing options to life-or-insight. Vital fluctuations provide visceral cost that alters the tracker’s subsequent command ("Record this") with awe.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ink geometries’ "malleability," avoiding moralizing via the earned final line. Cost is conceptual (redefining time perception) and physical (vitals), resisting tidy resolution while reweighting the eclipse’s significance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("serene anger," noticing ink’s "hidden geometries") creates rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift in "profound understanding" slightly disrupts consistency, but drone interactions showcase distinct goal-driven action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong propulsion with "eclipse’s final shadow passed" accelerating the climax, though "intricate pattern" followed by "ephemeral patterns" risks synonym churn. Zero artifacts in closure beat preserves the vital fluctuations’ impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms time-dilation tropes via disappearing ink’s physical mechanics and albino perception. Emotional specificity in "consciously wild" isolation avoids gimmickry, with the drone’s holographic vitals providing fresh, non-obvious stakes escalation.</comment>
