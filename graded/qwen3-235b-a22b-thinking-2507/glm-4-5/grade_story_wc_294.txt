<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—calm as survival mechanism versus inherited volatility—drive credible choices under pressure. Marcus lacks depth as pure antagonist, slightly weakening relationship dynamics despite strong interiority in key beats like the currency ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable cost: "changed by the journey itself" crystallizes the circular path realization amid bankruptcy. Orientation anchors cleanly in para 3; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through the final image’s reweighting of territories.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Abandoned circus train functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (server rooms in cages) and charges closure (departure). "Dusky harmony" repetition slightly weakens specificity, but peeling paint and ritual currency study vividly filter urgency through Elias’s priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (legacy vs. creation) tightens through Elias’s refusal to abandon principles, narrowing options to dignified failure. Marcus’s static aggression lacks escalation; cost is legible in bankruptcy but pressure plateau limits deepening beyond one meaningful turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "why paths circle back" resolves through concrete journey not moralizing. Final image reweights money collection as donated lessons, avoiding thematic echo. Slight over-reliance on "territories" metaphor prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Elias’s selective attention (currency details over financials) and rhythmic control under stress. "Perceptively calm" repetition erodes voice consistency in peak beats, creating scaffold that dulls immediacy during Marcus confrontation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong propulsion until repetitive "perceptively calm" (5x) and "dusky harmony" (3x) create synonym churn in high-pressure beats. Final line’s specificity elevates closure, but filter-verb stacks ("maintained," "represented") slightly blunt momentum in reflection passages.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of circus/train decay with digital mapping premise; specificity of foreign currencies grounds universal theme. Risk-taking in quiet closure lands perfectly, though "territorial markers" concept feels slightly familiar without deeper innovation.</comment>
