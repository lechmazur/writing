<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction weak; "rhythm of belonging" motivation clear but epiphany leans abstract ("never alone" lacks embodied cost). Strength: micro-choice removing gloves reveals hierarchy of values. Diagnostic label-speak in climax ("profound simplicity of belonging") triggers -0.4 deduction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (feather transformation, "eternal dance" realization) with conceptual cost. Weakness: feather's origin unexplained creates causality gap. Non-closure accumulation cap (-0.8) for one distinct issue (unmotivated object introduction) despite strong Accumulative/Textural lens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment constrains choice (water pressure, glass dome) and charges final image (sunlight enhancing glow). Masterful sensory hierarchy: helmet light cuts shadows, bioluminescence patterns mirror galaxies. Meets 9+ gate with dome/glass micro-setting shaping the glove-removal choice and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (belonging quest) signaled early but pressure lacks meaningful escalation; Maya follows feather passively. One deepening (constellation revelation) but cost (transformed self) felt rather than dramatized. Band guardrail: visible price missing for 8.8+ despite strong Accumulative lens coherence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (feather, constellations) avoiding moralizing. Final image ("eternal dance of connection") reweights premise non-literally. Near-failure: "rhythm of all living things" borders platitude but saved by bioluminescent specificity. No thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("rust suspended in time") but "shadowseam wonder" disrupts consistency. Rhythmic control falters during climax ("tears welled... understanding dawned" cadence). Overwriting in "luminous respite" passage dilutes pressure. Strong Accumulative voice modulation otherwise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops: "softly ingenious" repeated 3x without deepening. "Shared exhale" metaphor feels unearned abstraction. Final paragraph's abstract phrasing ("profound simplicity") dulls closure image. Text-artifact penalty (-0.6) for figurative muddle in peak beat disallows 9+ globally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms underwater research trope via astrological lens. "Burnt feather" is fresh but underdeveloped; avoids safety middle with quiet ending. Derivative Premise Guardrail avoided through specific bioluminescent-constellation synthesis. Risk distinction (+0.3) for lyrical structure enhancing coherence.</comment>
