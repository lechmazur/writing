<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "awkwardly confident stride" amid chaos, but rebellion backstory lacks specific stakes; epiphany earned through sensory surrender to stones, though "revolution of the spirit" risks abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: light enveloping her while bare feet ground her crystallizes the cost of abandoning opera glasses for new vision under Accumulative lens; stone hum’s escalation reweights hope with palpable vibration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Abandoned repair bay actively constrains movement (debris, crippled freighter) and charges closure—fallen opera glasses on dusty floor embody the shift from technological to primal connection, making setting indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (meaning in rebellion’s mess) tightens via stone circle’s hum forcing surrender of opera glasses; cost legible in "she paid them no mind," though rebellion context remains slightly abstract for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><grade>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (stones vs. opera glasses), but "revolution of the spirit" in climax edges toward thematic echo; final image reweights "meaning" as embodied action, not abstract ideal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "toes curling around debris" and "margin of daylight" sustains Accumulative lens; rhythmic control peaks with "thunderous serenity" absorbing fears—no head-hopping, only profound sensory compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but "spirit reached for the heavens" slightly muddles the climax; otherwise, high density shines ("brass casing warm from her grip" conveys history, tension, and intimacy in six words).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spaceport decay and ancient stones transforms rebellion tropes; "margin of daylight" as active pressure—not metaphor—earns risk distinction by grounding transcendence in bare feet on dusty floor.</comment>
