<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marcus's vertical perspective and "weightless burden" create concrete interiority, but his motivation lacks friction; the obsession with ceilings feels abstract without embodied contradictions. Final choice to engage spirits earns through prior dust analysis micro-choice, yet emotional progression remains tidily resolved without visible irrationality under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "heavy silence" crystallizes stakes, while "burdened with purpose" makes the cost legible as Marcus transforms his curse into connection. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—the buzzing cadence shift to silence reweights reality with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The mainspring barrel functions as micro-setting, constraining Marcus's final action (raising it toward the ceiling) and charging the closure image with its "rhythmic heartbeat." Circus setting remains atmospheric postcard, but the tool's irreplaceable mechanics elevate it past Q3 9+ gate requirements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pressure escalates purely through Accumulative density: buzzing intensifies, dust patterns defy physics, then the 4:17 silence forces stance crystallization. Marcus's agency in waiting for the precise moment narrows options, with cost legible in the "heavy anticipation" that reweights the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the mainspring's evolution from "impossibly light" to "burdened with purpose," avoiding moralizing. Final image of "rhythmic heartbeat cleaving through the barrier" offers non-literal answer to "what ceilings hide," though "prisoners in broken timepiece" risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in Marcus's vertical observations ("dust dancing," "flickered erratically"), but scaffold weakens voice: "weightless burden" repeats verbatim, and horologist backstory intrudes with explanatory tone. Rhythmic control falters during reflection, though stress compresses diction effectively at 4:17.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in Q7: "weightless burden" repetition creates synonym churn, and the horologist backstory paragraph uses template cadence ("The ticket office had been... Local legends..."). No closure artifacts, but pre-closure loops prevent 8.8+; otherwise strong propulsion through concrete verbs like "scooped," "sputter," "cleaving."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elevator technician + ghost-seeing + circus horologist feels inevitable, with dust analysis as ghost-detection method being brilliantly specific. However, "cracks in façade" trope lacks transformation, and circus setting could be swapped for any abandoned venue without breaking logic.</comment>
