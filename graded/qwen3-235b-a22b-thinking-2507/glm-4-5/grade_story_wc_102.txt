<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses—seeking closure while fearing vulnerability—manifest in micro-choices like breath control. Her spiritual curiosity avoids diagnostic labels until the tear's "healing wounds across lifetimes" phrasing triggers a -0.5 deduction for over-articulation during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tear dissolving into her skin crystallizes the cost of releasing unused love. Orientation fails—no clear "when" established by 120 words—triggering -0.4; otherwise the Accumulative/Textural lens (density of breath/fog imagery) would have scored 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Twilight viaduct actively constrains choice: mist enables the camera obscura projection, wisteria blooms mirror emotional release. Only deduction: "foggy lucidity" leans generic despite later thematic charge. Final image of floating blooms meets 9+ gate by reweighting unused love.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>One tightening via breath agency: inhales draw "forgotten moments," exhales release burdens. Stakes stay abstract until the tear dissolves—visible cost lands late but earns high band. Dominant stake ("where unused love is stored") transforms into "how to release it" with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Final wisteria image answers "where unused love is stored" non-literally without moralizing. But "pilgrim of sparks" concept is over-explained in denouement dialogue ("where does unused love go?"), triggering -0.4 for Thematic Echo undermining earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "wisteria blooms cascaded like purple waterfalls" filters setting through artist’s gaze. Late exposition ("her reputation grew...") slightly dilutes voice, but rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure—short breaths accelerate tension, long sentences mirror release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; "pearl-like drop holding compassion" is minor figurative muddle (contradicting tear's liquid nature) in peak beat, costing -0.3. Otherwise immaculate propulsion: "breath patterns shifted" syntax mirrors her changing state without filter-verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms spiritual tropes via camera obscura as meditation tool—fresh synthesis where tech enables transcendence. But "Kwan Yin's tear" lacks distinctive angle, leaning on familiar Buddhist iconography without sufficient reinvention for 9+ band.</comment>
