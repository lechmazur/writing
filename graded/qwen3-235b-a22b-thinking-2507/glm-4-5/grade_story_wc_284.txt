<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices like pocketing the pillbox as future token, but spy backstory relies on telling ("burned spy") over causal demonstration of fractured identity during snow-carving pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost in "accepting fractures as maps," holding the Accumulative/Textural lens through snow-code pattern evolution to final key flourish; cost crystallized in "ashes nourish new growth" reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting of engraved pillbox constrains choice when repurposed from relic container to future-token vessel, charging the final image; mist's "silver hush" evolves from oppressive to approving through character's shifting perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Volkov's snow-code method—shifting from self-conversation to daughter-focused resolve—under Accumulative pressure, with the pillbox's repurposing making the cost of accepting fractures viscerally legible in the descent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through snow-code lattice → key reconfiguration, avoiding moralizing; "fractures as maps" offers non-literal answer to "fixing what's broken" by showing brokenness as navigational tool rather than failure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "fingers he no longer fully trusted" and "storm within him raged," with rhythmic control shifting from mist's "silver hush" to decisive "snapped shut"; no POV leakage despite dense reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Silver hush" repetition creates paraphrase loop in high-pressure beats (-0.4), but snow-code description achieves high density; "prudently daring" label weakens otherwise strong embodied prose during descent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms spy tropes through snow-code method and pillbox repurposing; "fractures as maps" reconfiguration feels inevitable from accumulated snow imagery without derivative safety-hedging.</comment>
