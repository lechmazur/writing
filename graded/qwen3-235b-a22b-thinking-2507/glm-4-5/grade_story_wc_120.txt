<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but lacks contradictory impulses; "chronologically homesick" functions as diagnostic label without embodied tradeoffs during memory mapping. No visible flaw-driven resistance to exhaustion weakens causality for closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with strong Charged Poise closure ("time folded in on itself") and legible cost in collapse. Non-closure Accumulation Cap applied for one distinct issue: exhaustion motivation insufficiently earned through prior choices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: nautilus shell and glass spire actively constrain choices (refracting light for symphony mapping) and charge final image. Near-9.0 deduction only for sparse tactile spire interaction during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (conduct symphony before exhaustion) lacks meaningful tightening; escalation passive as exhaustion "creeps" without protagonist agency testing commitment. No visible price paid until collapse fails band guardrail for 8.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly through particulars ("first taste of honey," "grass beneath bare feet") with final image reweighting "chronological homesickness" as non-literal answer. Capped at 8.8 per high-band gate due to Q2 < 9.0 despite exceptional execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("refracting colors into miniature rainbows") and rhythmic control shine, but filter-verb stack ("he could feel... could sense... could see") in high-pressure beat triggers -0.5 artifact penalty, disallowing 9+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with minimal loops; "exhaustion" paraphrase cycle ("creeping... waning... claimed him") incurs -0.3 Non-closure Accumulation Cap. Figurative language remains clear and pressure-appropriate throughout peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms fortune-cookie trope through synesthetic memory mapping, but avoids bold structural risk; lyrical approach feels safe rather than revelatory despite fresh emotional specificity in "unheard symphonies" premise.</comment>
