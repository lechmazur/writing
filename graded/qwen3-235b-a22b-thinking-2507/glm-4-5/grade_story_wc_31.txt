<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority shows concrete synesthesia ("foghorn deep purple") but lacks contradictory impulses; the vow to help others is earned though slightly abstract. Librarian functions as plot device, not character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the shimmering palm and multicolored flames crystallize irreversible transformation with visible cost. Orientation anchors pier/shift within 40 words; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through symphony escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Skeleton key (micro-setting) constrains every choice—vibrates, reshapes, dissolves—and charges closure via palm shimmer. Pier’s "weathered boards" contrast library’s preservation, making environment pivotal to final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: key’s vibration narrows options, librarian’s "few possess" raises cost, and vow dissolution forces endurance. Synesthesia quest transforms into tangible burden with shimmering palm as irrevocable price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through luminous vows’ physicality—colored symphony reweights "language of light" without moralizing. Final multicolored flames offer resonant answer, though librarian’s "acknowledge/honor" edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("laughter brilliant yellow") shines, but librarian’s archaic "I’ve been waiting" disrupts voice consistency. Rhythmic control falters slightly in exposition beats despite strong pressure modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "meteor hush" and "robes woven from starlight" show textural specificity. Minor deduction for "vow of pure silver light" straining metaphor, though payoff with luminous vows justifies risk.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through synesthesia-as-bridge: key’s vibration, waterless immersion, and lantern-music synchronization feel inevitable. Emotional specificity ("heart of a lamplighter") avoids generic mysticism.</comment>
