<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation to "understand texture of time" remains abstract despite vivid interiority; pivotal epiphany about time's tapestry lacks contradictory impulses or embodied struggle during the timeless suspension moment, weakening earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "time was no longer a mystery but a comfort" crystallizes stakes with visible cost ("weight of responsibility"), though the "suddenly timeless" trigger edges toward convenient escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Emerald silo and urn fragment constrain choices (daily descent, decoding rituals) and charge the final image ("sanctuary," "warm in her palm"), but garage-sale setting lacks tactile integration beyond thematic echo.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake escalation through accumulated understanding ("time was not linear... a tapestry") reweights options credibly, yet the pressure lacks visceral urgency despite legible cost; agency shines in embedding her own messages.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: urn fragment's temperature shift and garage-sale code reprise reconfigure "texture of time" without moralizing; final image avoids sentimentality through concrete sensory payoff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("fingers tracing emerald-veined walls," "humming with residual energy") creates distinct temporal texture; rhythmic compression during timeless suspension ("world seemed to freeze") heightens pressure without obfuscation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere ("leaking moments like water through a sieve") or character; final line's triadic rhythm ("comfort, a guide, and a friend") crystallizes closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-as-texture with garage-sale cryptography avoids cliché; emotional specificity in her quiet epiphany ("warm now, as if acknowledging") transforms familiar timekeeper tropes through lived detail.</comment>
