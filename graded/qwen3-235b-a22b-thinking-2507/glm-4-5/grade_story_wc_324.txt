<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("persistently curious" vs. initial skepticism) drives action; embodied emotions (tightening grip on hearing aid) avoid label-speak. Final choice earned by grandmother backstory, but child's thin characterization limits relationship crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens crystal-clear: photograph → pulse → garden → predator recognition. Closure lands as Earned Stasis ("pulses calm to steady rhythm") with undeniable cost (grandmother's decades-old warning resolved). Orientation flawless by word 30.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium functions as micro-setting: fog forces reliance on hearing aid, dim light necessitates emotional resonance detection. Final photograph reprise charges closure as "evidence of watchfulness," meeting 9+ gate via constraint-to-image evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elena's agency: institutional knowledge connects child's description to predator reports. Cost crystallizes in "reeling hush" realization and transformed photograph. Pressure narrows options cleanly under causal lens without coincidence resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "incidental heroism" mechanics: antique device's emotional residue prevents tragedy. Final image ("photograph fulfilled its purpose") reweights premise without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo but secondary stake ("assure mother") slightly overshadows core.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: notices "emotional resonance" over visual cues. Rhythm modulates perfectly—longer sentences for setup, staccato during crisis ("pulse frantic"). No POV leaks; tense/stage consistency flawless under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "reeling hush" motif evolves meaningfully across beats. Information density exceptional ("pulse flickering like irregular heartbeat" conveys urgency + device state). Minor deduction for "persistently curious" label repetition in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</comment><question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms "ghost helper" trope via hearing aid mechanics. Emotional specificity ("grandmother's unsuccessful warning shout") avoids genericity. Risk-taking (emotional residue as plot device) heightens stakes coherently without gimmickry.</comment>
