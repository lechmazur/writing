<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation to "interpret silence with empathy" drives concrete micro-choices (overlays, frame-by-frame analysis), and her final renunciation of mapping the mystery earns Earned Stasis with visible cost. Slight lack of visceral internal conflict in high-pressure beats limits to 8.7.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully: the map tear aligning with constellations reweights the henge’s meaning with undeniable conceptual cost ("knowledge exists not to be documented, but to be felt"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly through observational density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The rain-scoured fresco vault functions as micro-setting: rain’s drumming anchors urgency, while the vault’s decay mirrors eroded knowledge. The torn map constrains choices and charges the final image (repairing it to "honor the divide"), satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara’s agency—her overlays transform observation into celestial alignment discovery, narrowing options to accepting experiential knowledge. Cost is felt in her "profound sense of shielded openness," foreclosing documentation for reverence under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through the map’s repair: "profound cartography... in the human heart" avoids moralizing by reweighting the central question via the final image. No thematic echo; closure offers non-literal resonance by honoring mystery over solution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV’s perceptual signature shines in selective details ("faint outline of a structure," "trembling hands"), with rhythm modulating from methodical study to awe. Minor abstraction in "shielded openness" slightly dulls pressure but stays character-particular.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("marking even the slightest variations") propels momentum. Final line ("rain continued to scour the frescoes") recharges the motif without muddle. Slight register drift in "profound sense" costs 0.2 but avoids closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography and astronomy transforms "whispered chapel" into celestial phenomenon. Specificity (1920s surveillance, constellation path) grounds risk-taking, making the conceptual solution inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
