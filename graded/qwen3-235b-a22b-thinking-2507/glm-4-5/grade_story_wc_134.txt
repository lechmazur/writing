<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "clairvoyant who didn't see it coming" with embodied cost during shadow detachment; micro-choice to touch crystal reveals values but final epiphany edges toward thematic telling without sufficient struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly with conceptual cost ("gone from seer to participant") under Accumulative lens; pilgrim's convenient disappearance is the sole hairline slip in otherwise flawless pressure accumulation toward reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Crystal cave functions as micro-setting constraining choices (resonances guiding perception) and charges final image; cave pearl's physical warmth and heartbeat rhythm make environment indispensable to closure's tactile revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (identity as predictor vs creator) tightens through Elara's agency studying pearl, with visible cost crystallized in "gone from seer to participant"; escalation perfectly mirrors Accumulative lens via shadow density.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "bright darkness" imagery without moralizing until final line's near-thematic echo ("magic wasn't found in seeing...") slightly undermines earned resonance despite powerful closure image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "crystals resonate with new harmonies" and rhythmic control during high-pressure beats; minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" terminology disrupts otherwise seamless voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong propulsion but paraphrase loops in "steady predictability vanished, replaced by steadily unpredictable" and "crystallized within her mind" cliché; final paragraph's density borders on overwriting without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Bright darkness" synthesizes light/shadow tropes into fresh magic system; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though pilgrim's archetypal vagueness slightly reduces specificity.</comment>
