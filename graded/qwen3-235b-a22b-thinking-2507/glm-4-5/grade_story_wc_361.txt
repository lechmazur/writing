<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when jitters transform into confidence via embodied choices ("hollow space" vs "germinating spirit"), but mentor's absence weakens causal motivation for final transfer.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost ("hollow space" vs new confidence) under Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation anchored by line 5 aurora/ridgeway.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aurora-lit ridgeway and pendant constrain choices (sprouting shoots alter path) and charge final image ("ground trembled"), though mythic "fade" feels abstract.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when earth-sympathy causes literal sprouting, narrowing options to wonder-generation; cost legible in hollow chest vs new confidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment><question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sprouting metaphor, but final line's explicit moralizing ("wonder wasn't delivered—it was awakened") triggers Thematic Echo penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("jittery," aurora-dancing shadows) with rhythmic control; no head-hopping despite reflective passages.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Filter-verb stack ("recalling," "learned," "explained") dulls transfer scene momentum; "wonder blooming literally" edges toward purple prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of courier-as-wonder-awakener avoids trope; "vibrating sympathetically" transforms mundane into magical with causal integrity.</comment>
