<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's embodied motivation shines through concrete micro-choices (tilting head for reflection, key insertion) revealing contradictory impulses; Theodor's late appearance lacks setup but doesn't undermine her credible endurance under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost (alarms, escape ripples), but the puddle map's deus ex machina quality violates "coincidence may complicate not resolve" rule, triggering -0.8 non-closure accumulation cap.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Auric lagoon functions as active micro-setting: water reflection enables map discovery, golden surface charges final image, and liquid environment directly constrains vault access tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally through patrols→map→key solution, but the puddle map's sudden functionality weakens escalation as protagonist agency isn't fully driving the resolution under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through action ("coded freedom" in reflection/key use), with final image reweighting "rebel smiled grimly" offering non-literal answer to remembering's cost without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bruised purples," "liquid gold") modulates with tension, but Cyrillic corruption ("вони laughedнебр") disrupts rhythmic control during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful specificity, but minor artifacts ("realized memories" typo, final paragraph's slight overwriting) prevent 9+ eligibility despite strong propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms dystopian tropes through grounded details (TrueComm key, auric lagoon), though the puddle map's convenience slightly undercuts risk distinction despite emotional specificity.</comment>
