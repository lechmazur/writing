<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion ("voice like ice forming") and micro-choices in truth-weaving, but lacks contradictory impulses during pivotal dream analysis; final choice earned yet flaw depth remains underexplored despite strong motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with dream fragments escalating pressure; valid Charged Poise closure at glacier shrine carries conceptual cost of healed rupture, though "windows of connection" concept tests stakes slightly late in escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Glacier shrine and snow globe function as micro-setting charging final image (clear globe on altar), but ocean dive lacks tactile specificity; "borrowed starlight" motif enriches tone yet sensory hierarchy underutilizes touch in high-pressure dive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. lies) tightens through dream documentation; Elara's agency in gradual exposure creates visible cost (emotional labor of careful weaving), though escalation could deepen moral calculus before descendants' confessions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through snow globe's transformation (melted→clear), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "salvaging purity" with conceptual cost, though slight echo of "pure" in closing line edges toward thematic redundancy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ghost whisperer" lens) with rhythmic control, but generic phrasing ("precious lives," "dancing shadows") dilutes voice; "borrowed starlight" motif sustains coherence without overwriting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with minimal loops; "windows of connection" repetition reweights meaningfully, though "weave truth carefully" tells where showing would strengthen momentum in dream-analysis beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wreck-diving and ghost whispering transforms tropes through specific mechanics (dream cameos); moral complexity avoids safety middle, yet emotional progression could heighten risk-taking beyond current boldness.</comment>
