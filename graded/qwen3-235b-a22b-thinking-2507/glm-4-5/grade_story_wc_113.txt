<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>No earned change or visible cost in Elias's stance; his "strange kinship" with the ghost lacks contradictory impulses during the climax. Motivation is clear but static, with no micro-choices under pressure beyond playing the piano. Interiority avoids therapy-speak but misses opportunities for embodied conflict during the performance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (transformed hush with conceptual cost), fulfilling the accumulative/textural lens. Pressure builds through sensory density but lacks meaningful deepening—Elias's realization about the ghost's code doesn't alter tactics. Orientation is flawless, yet escalation feels passive rather than driven by agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Water functions as micro-setting that constrains movement (ankle-deep flooding), enables discovery (floating program), and charges the closure (light reflecting "like shimmering stars"). Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered through a musician's lens, with the piano's "ivory keys gleaming like pearls" directly shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (completing the ghost's performance) tightens via Elias's decision to play, with the program's dissolution as legible cost. But escalation lacks agency-driven deepening—the music's "ancient and new" quality doesn't create new complications or trade-offs, relying on atmospheric accumulation rather than meaningful pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of liminal transcendence emerges through concrete actions (water-stained notation, dissolving program), avoiding moralizing. The final image—"hush returned, but now peaceful, complete"—resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral. Slightly undermined by "liminal threshold" telling early on, but earns complexity through the ghost's unresolved vanishing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines: Elias notices "water damage created peculiar images" as musical notation, with rhythm modulating from "tentatively" to "growing confidence." No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens during the performance. Minor register drift in "ethereal patterns" but stays within a musician's plausible lexicon under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is largely propulsion-focused ("Elias carefully lifted the program, noticing how the stains formed..."), but "shift and change" shows slight redundancy. Final line ("completing the conversation that silence had interrupted") delivers high density without muddle. No loops or scaffold, though "miraculously untouched" risks overwriting without pattern-teaching.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms ghost-story tropes through specific musical logic (water-damaged notation as ghostly code) and flooded setting. Risk-taking with quiet Charged Poise closure feels inevitable, heightening stakes without gimmickry. Freshness anchored in verifiable details like the piano's preservation, avoiding derivative "safety middle" choices.</comment>
