<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction absent; motivation clear but no simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene (e.g., reverence vs. doubt). Final choice earned but lacks layered emotional friction during pivotal stone placement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds—disappearance reconfigures navigation with conceptual cost ("Kael was gone"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, though cost legibility slightly blurred by poetic abstraction in final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bone towers and arrowhead depression constrain choices (guiding movement, enabling placement). Final image charged by humming earth and pulsing artifact, though canyon echoes remain atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via crow patterns shifting direction, narrowing options to canyon's heart. Cost (physical dissolution) unmistakable in "Kael was gone," but escalation leans more on environmental cues than protagonist agency under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "standing still could be the most dynamic journey" crystallized through stone-skimming practice and bird patterns. Final arrowhead pulse offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust that had settled over centuries of layered existence") and rhythmic control ("fractured light from the bone towers"). Compression taught early sustains legibility through lyrical density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "weathered resolve" repetition (Q4 setup/final beat) and dense figurative language in high-pressure moments slightly dull immediacy, though final image remains clear and propelled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stone-skimming physics and spiritual navigation avoids fantasy tropes. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes coherently, with bone towers and harmonic stones grounding universality in specific, verifiable detail.</comment>
