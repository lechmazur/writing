<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract despite poetic description; "half-spoken secret" lacks embodied contradiction. Final renunciation earned but micro-choices lack specific tradeoffs beyond light manipulation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with conceptual cost (transformed secret), but orientation test waiver risks linger—midpoint lens ambiguity slightly weakens escalation under Accumulative/Textural framework.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dental mirror functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (light redirection) and charges final image; cobalt dock’s wet surface actively pressures movement. Sensory specificity avoids tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unspoken secret’s weight) tightens through visitor’s physical reactions, but conceptual cost lacks visceral legibility; escalation relies on atmospheric pressure over concrete tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action (shutter patterns teaching darkness), no moralizing. Final image reweights "value of stars" with conceptual cost of transformed secret, avoiding tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (light-as-language) shines, but "spiralingly calm" repetition disrupts rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulates effectively until final beats where abstraction creeps in.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Spiralingly calm" and "stillwater tension" loops in high-pressure beats trigger -0.4 artifact penalty; otherwise vivid propulsion. Final image’s "patterns on cobalt dock" avoids closure dulling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dental mirror’s transformation from dental tool to "key" offers fresh synthesis. Avoids trope safety through specific light-weaving mechanics, though "silent guardian" archetype limits risk.</comment>
