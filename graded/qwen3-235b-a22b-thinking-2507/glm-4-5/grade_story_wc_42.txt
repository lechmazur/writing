<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("confined close to stars yet separated") shows embodied conflict, but "luminous ache" repeats as diagnostic label-speak in peak beats, triggering anti-pattern penalties for unearned embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with conceptual cost (transcended perception's limits), but the epiphany transition ("placed the clock outside") lacks causal texture under Accumulative lens, weakening escalation legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lunar observatory functions as micro-setting: elevation enables cloud imagery that pressures choices (placing clock "away from artificial sounds"), and tools (camera/filters) directly charge the final image of captured phenomena.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes (observatory stability/perception limits) tighten through Elara's resonance solution, but the "leaf falling" insight relies on coincidence (audible sound in vacuum) that complicates without protagonist-driven escalation, capping escalation depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the final image of "luminous energy" reweights "ephemeral" as both goal and cost without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite "luminous ache" overuse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fingers accustomed to intricate mechanisms") shines, but repetitive "luminous ache" scaffolding dulls rhythmic control during peak pressure, violating 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density falters in closure beat: "luminous ache" synonym loops ("breathtaking pattern... seemed to ache") and physics error (sound in vacuum) create figurative muddle that dulls the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantum observation/resonance physics feels inevitable, but vacuum sound error undermines conceptual integrity; risk-taking elevates stakes yet lacks full execution coherence.</comment>
