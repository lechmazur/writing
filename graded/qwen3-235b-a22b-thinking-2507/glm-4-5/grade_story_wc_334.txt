<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion ("weathered fingers," "hands trembling") but lacks contradictory impulses; motivation clear yet uncomplicated by flaws. "Crisp nostalgia" risks diagnostic label-speak though redeemed by context.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost ("memories weren't stolen but borrowed"). Orientation perfect in first 50 words; Accumulative lens holds through constellation/mushroom pattern accumulation to final dimming.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse actively constrains choices (navigating sunken structure), with shipwrecks' "sigh" directly mirroring memory release. Micro-setting (fairy ring) charges final image decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim identity) signaled immediately; pressure grows through pattern recognition under Accumulative lens. Cost visible in "skeletal frames settling deeper," though escalation lacks meaningful tightening beyond deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Folklore isn't just story but memory made tangible" emerges organically through fairy ring's function. Final image reweights premise without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("chronically curious nature") with rhythm modulating under pressure. Minor register drift in "crisp nostalgia" slightly disrupts voice cohesion during peak revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Near-flawless density: "vines that had claimed the space" shows textural specificity. One minor overwrite ("tingle of something just beyond comprehension") but final line charges closure perfectly without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms memory-loss trope through folkloric lens; "broken constellations" and "borrowed memories" feel fresh. Specific details (doctorate memory, coffee taste) ground universal stakes with emotional truth.</comment>
