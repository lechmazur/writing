<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (mechanical precision vs philosophical fluidity) drive decoding choices; student’s underdevelopment slightly weakens earned comprehension cost at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (student’s transformed understanding); Accumulative lens holds via sensory density tightening through sundial alignment beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>No figurative muddle in closure, but "perfect comprehension" flattens emotional cost; minor paraphrase loop in "dignified chaos" repetitions near midpoint.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dueling philosophy with mechanical arm as conceptual tool; risk-taking in sewing needle cryptography elevates stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
