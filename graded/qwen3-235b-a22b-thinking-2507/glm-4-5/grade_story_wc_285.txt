<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in spindrift serenity vs. pricked thumb’s haste-vow echoes, but "distill complexity" abstraction slightly undermines embodied motivation at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds flawlessly; rain gutters' stop creates Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost (enduring the veil's weight), though lens ambiguity check barely clears at midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: rain gutters constrain ritual timing, yarn needle charges final knot, fog actively resists stitching—environment shapes every choice with tactile precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stake tightening via gutter ticks is masterful, but "palimpsest promise" abstraction slightly blurs cost legibility; pricked thumb’s blood feels earned yet understated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through needlework and droplet rhythms; final knot reweights "neither here nor there" without moralizing, avoiding all thematic echo traps.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("metronomic regularity," "spindrift serenity") controls rhythm under pressure; zero POV drift despite lyrical compression teaching its pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line propulsion flawless until "distill complexity" abstraction in climax—a single thematic phrase marring otherwise dense, loop-free prose in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Risk-taking elevates trope: yarn needle ritual transforms guardian archetype through concrete labor, with emotional truth anchoring every fresh inflection.</comment>
