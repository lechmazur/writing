<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion ("forehead against cool wall") but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; motivation is clear yet internal conflict remains abstract without visible tradeoffs during pivotal realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with thematic weight but fails cost proof test—no legible sacrifice in final image despite "weight of collapsing stars" setup; Accumulative lens holds yet escalation lacks tangible price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Astral orchard constrains choices via luminous shadows during realization and charges closure with "blossomed brighter still"; micro-setting (bathroom basin) anchors philosophical shift but "captured starlight" cliché slightly dilutes specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forbidden knowledge pursuit) tightens through Elias' focused attention triggering monitors, yet cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt; pressure coheres but payoff lacks concrete forfeiture beyond abstract "weight".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "nonlinear inheritance" motif but final paragraph's "would change all histories" edges into thematic echo; earned resonance undermined by near-moralizing in cosmic-scale implications.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("phosphorescence casting long shadows") and rhythmic control shine, though "simply complicated" repetition creates subtle voice convergence; no head-hopping but bathroom breakthrough framing feels expositional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("brightened disquiet" x3, "simply complicated" x2) and "somehow pulsating" weaken density; strong opening/closing lines but mid-story scaffold ("resonance field... санузл") dulls momentum without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic archive tropes via pistachio shell cameo earns distinction, yet "forbidden knowledge" premise lacks non-obvious moral calculus; specificity in orchard physics elevates but bathroom method feels safety-hedged.</comment>
