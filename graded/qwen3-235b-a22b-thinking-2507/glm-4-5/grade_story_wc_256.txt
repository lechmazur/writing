<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("texture of connection") with diagnostic label-speak in peak beats, triggering -0.5 penalty; embodied emotion ("fingers danced," "closed her eyes") lacks contradictory impulses or visible struggle against her flaw of relentless curiosity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the hum of the lens crystallizes options (endless pilgrimage) with conceptual cost (the weight of unending discovery); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density buildup to the miners' song revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the lamp lens constrains choice (precise placement on resonator) and charges the final image (humming testament); "golden shadows" evolve from atmospheric detail to embodied cost as they "lengthen" with the day's end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through the lens activation (one meaningful intensification), but the conceptual cost ("work far from finished") remains abstract; pressure lacks visceral escalation as the pilgrimage continues unchanged despite revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the miners' song reprise without moralizing; the final image (picking up another artifact as lens hums) reweights "artificial pilgrimage" as endless inquiry, though the phrase borders on thematic echo in mid-scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct sound-focused perceptual signature ("harmonies silenced for decades") with rhythmic control, but synonym churn ("quest"/"pilgrimage"/"tapestry") in peak beats contaminates voice and dulls immediacy near closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density falters with paraphrase loops ("texture of connection" → "tapestry of human experience"); "powerfully gentle" label repeats without showing tradeoffs, triggering -0.5 artifact penalty that disallows 9+ globally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound archaeology via miner's lens avoids magic-realism tropes; emotional specificity in the bell ringer's quiet dedication elevates, though "artificial pilgrimage" framing lacks bold risk-taking.</comment>
