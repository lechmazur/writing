<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines ("motivation burned brighter than revolutionary flame") but lacks micro-choices under pressure; closure feels earned through prior causality yet misses embodied cost in pivotal writing scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with storm intensification, but Orientation Test fails at 150 words (unclear setting/stakes), applying -0.4 penalty; Charged Poise closure lands with conceptual cost ("constellation of possibilities").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: crystal shard constrains choices (writing surface) and charges final image as "sacred relic"; "spiraling gold filigree" and temporal storm details are purpose-driven, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (archaeological dispute) remains abstract; pressure escalates via storm's sensory density but lacks on-page tightening of options or tangible cost—Elias faces no opposition during writing, weakening Accumulative escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through vase shard's transformation ("shatter and still reflect beauty"); final image reweights truth as "constellation" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo in charged, non-literal resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("burnished sorrow," "chaotic, beautiful tapestry") with rhythmic control under pressure; voice modulates from reflective to urgent, teaching pattern early without scaffold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or figurative muddle; "golden dust motes" to "chaotic, beautiful tapestry" shows high density. Minor synonym churn ("shimmering fragment glimmered"/"shimmering curtains") prevents 9.5.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "archaeological dispute" trope through visible-Time mechanic; "burnished sorrow" as irreplaceable tone avoids generic melancholy. Risk-taking heightens stakes but conceptual resolution lacks visceral friction.</comment>
