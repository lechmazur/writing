<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: fear of funding loss vs. epiphany about embracing uncertainty. Micro-choices (touching cicada, observing pools) reveal hierarchy of values. Professor Aris exists solely to trigger Maya’s earned renunciation of direct inquiry, fitting scope constraints.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: funding scarcity transforms from obstacle to essential discovery component. Accumulative lens holds—pressure builds through sensory density until "texture of time" crystallizes options. Final image (cicada/stars/pools triad) makes conceptual cost legible without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tidal pools function as micro-setting that constrains choice: their transitional nature directly inspires Maya’s sustainable research model. Jade cicada charges closure image while reflecting urgency—its warmth shifts from comfort to metamorphosis symbol during high-pressure realization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stake escalation is pure Accumulative: funding scarcity deepens from existential threat to "essential component of discovery" through Maya’s agency. Cost is unmistakable in "embrace uncertainties as essential," altering tactics as she reframes research. Single tightening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "texture of time" insight reweights pools/cicada/pause without moralizing. Final image (cicada glowing with stars/pools) offers resonant answer to central question—transitions as substance, not gaps—through concrete particulars, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "warmly observant eyes tracing patterns" filters all detail. Rhythmic control under pressure—longer sentences during reflection, clipped cadence at climax ("The difficult conversation resumed..."). Elision of funding specifics taught early and pays off in thematic density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fragile ecosystem through the changes" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Final line ("jade cicada a silent witness") crystallizes closure without figurative muddle. Minor cliché ("pulsing as if alive") redeemed by later "glow" reprise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tidal pools reframing academic funding crisis feels inevitable. Emotional specificity (chronicler’s anxiety meeting ecological wisdom) avoids tropes. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes—funding uncertainty embraced as discovery catalyst without gimmickry.</comment>
