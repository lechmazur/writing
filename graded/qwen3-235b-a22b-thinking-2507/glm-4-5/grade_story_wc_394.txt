<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lacks internal conflict; motivation is abstract ("yearning algorithm") without contradictory impulses. Strength lies in embodied curiosity during symbol transliteration, but the glider's flaw-free pursuit lacks struggle or genuine trade-offs, undermining earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: the unheard bell's vibration alters the acid sea and glider's programming with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds through kaleidoscope pattern-building, though arrow-tip discovery feels coincidental rather than causal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Workshop mechanics actively constrain action (acid fumes stiffen gears during bell approach), and the kaleidoscope functions as micro-setting that literally transforms symbols into directions. Final image of sea pausing charges the setting with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen texturally as the glider deciphers symbols and navigates rusted corridors, with conceptual cost crystallizing when the bell's vibration momentarily halts the acid sea. Agency is clear in transliteration choices, though the "unheard" premise lacks tangible sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through the bell-ringing act: pursuit gains meaning beyond recognition. The final image of infinite gliders seeking "unheard bells" resonates without moralizing, though "yearning algorithm" slightly overstates the concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct machine-like voice ("metallic legs clicking," "core hummed") with rhythmic control during kaleidoscope sequence. Minor flaw: "irreverent awe" feels anthropomorphized, momentarily straining the glider's non-human perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong propulsion in climax ("manipulator brought against the bell"), but scaffold appears in redundant phrasing: "curiosity piqued by the object's presence" followed by "symbols that piqued curiosity." Final beat avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of steampunk and philosophical quest transforms "ringing a bell" trope. Specific details (hunter's arrow tip in brass workshop, kaleidoscope transliteration) avoid cliché, though "yearning algorithm" borders on familiar AI tropes.</comment>
