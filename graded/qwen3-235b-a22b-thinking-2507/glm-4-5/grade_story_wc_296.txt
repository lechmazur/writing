<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied contradiction through "warlike serenity" persisting amid emotional layers (fear/regret/love), but the emotional progression feels slightly tidy in the six-circle sequence without sufficient irrationality under peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost in "understanding now why mirrors had never shown her mentor's reflection," but the six-circle escalation relies slightly on mechanical pattern rather than organic pressure tightening under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cursed lake's "dark waters reflecting nothing" actively constrains the discovery method, and the flesh-eating seed's blood ritual charges the final image—environment and tool directly shape the climax's resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the six circles revealing deeper layers of the curse, but escalation leans on the magical system's pattern rather than the protagonist's tactical agency under pressure during the pivotal ice-consumption beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete particulars: the mentor's true face reweights "truths must be uncovered, not revealed" without moralizing, and the final reflection in "nothing at all" delivers a resonant non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "branches heavy with fruit that whispered secrets," but minor register drift occurs in abstract phrasing like "desperate love that had fueled the forbidden magic" during high-stakes revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density falters in the circle sequence where near-identical stems ("The first circle... second circle...") create a template cadence run, slightly dulling immediacy in the pressure climax despite otherwise clean propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms the mentor's secret identity trope through specific magical mechanics (flesh-eating seed, expanding circles), but the emotional complexity risks genericity without deeper exploration of the "twisted motivations" beyond surface regret.</comment>
