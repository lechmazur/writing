<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction weak; "heart quickened" lacks embodied conflict during diary discovery. No visible trade-off between curiosity and risk despite Thorne's abrupt ending.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands cleanly with "weight of legacy's burden," but lens ambiguity at midpoint: Accumulative/Textural dominates but Situational elements muddy causality during film development.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage functions as micro-setting: constrains movement (side passage "swallowed by greenery"), enables discovery (fireplace preservation), and charges final image with "dreams of walls" resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through film-diary synergy, but cost remains abstract; "weight of legacy" lacks visceral embodiment. Agency weakens when climate shifts (off-page pressure) resolve discovery logistics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from architectural memory concept, but "accumulated consciousness" borders on thematic echo; final image reweights "walls dream" without stating moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sensitively perceptive" filtering sensory details) shines, though lab scene's "trembling hands" briefly converges with generic discovery tropes under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor scaffold: "resonant echoes"/"resonant phenomena" proximity creates synonym loop. "Breath catch" cliché avoided by contextual specificity in film development beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of eco-fiction and archival mystery through "echo cartography," though climate shifts backdrop feels underutilized as active pressure rather than atmospheric setting.</comment>
