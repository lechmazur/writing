<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "becoming less human meant losing part of what made her love" is potent but underexplored during metamorphosis; embodied emotion shines in "eyes becoming pools of night sky" yet micro-choices lack deeper value hierarchy beyond initial spice mixing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost in "connection began to fade... 'Remember this,' his voice whispered"; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density without causality breaks; moonlight-root connection crystallizes the stake reweighting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fairy-tale orchard functions as micro-setting: moonlight-drinking roots and cosmic-dust spices directly constrain the conjure method; final image of "morning's light found the orchard" charges the earned stasis closure with environmental consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Eliora's agency—spice mixing and glyph-breathing deepen the bond-reforging goal under Accumulative lens; cost is felt in the fading connection, though the phoenix timeframe's urgency lacks tangible pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Love transcends form" emerges organically from brother's dialogue and the spice-circle ritual, avoiding moralizing; final image of "bond unbreakably forged" reweights prior loss through concrete sensory struggle, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "perfume possibility of rare spices" and "voice like wind through dry grass"; rhythmic compression during metamorphosis ("Her eyes changed first...") sustains tension without sacrificing voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop in "becoming less human meant losing... Yet after phoenix rose, possibilities unfurled" slightly dulls momentum; otherwise, "translucent hands reaching toward hers, not quite touching" exemplifies high-density propulsion without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Spice-based conjuration transforms the "contact the dead" trope through specific, grounded mechanics; cosmic intimacy avoids sentimentality by rooting transcendence in physical details like moon-pepper and root-soil connection.</comment>
