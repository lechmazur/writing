<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Diagnostic label-speak ("motivation burned with quiet intensity") triggers -0.5 penalty; no contradictory impulses or visible flaws complicate choices despite high stakes, failing the 9+ quick test. Interiority remains abstract rather than embodied under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Earned Stasis with the prophecy transformed and released, but the cost ("profound relief") lacks concrete legibility—no on-page moment shows the price paid. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds consistently, yet cost proof test fails.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The origami wing functions as micro-setting, constraining ritual choices and charging the final image (crane floating away). However, sensory details over-rely on visual clichés ("moonlight weaving silver") without tactile specificity, blocking 9+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes (hushing prophecy) are clear but pressure lacks visible cost escalation; the summoner faces no opposition, and "relief" feels unearned. Agency drives the ritual, yet escalation isn't tied to protagonist choices narrowing options under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of transformation through silence emerges via the wing's metamorphosis, with the final image reweighting the prophecy as harmless. But "terrestrially cosmic" introduces pseudo-profound jargon that dilutes earned complexity, preventing higher resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature ("water flowing over stones with the determination of blood") modulates rhythm with ritual intensity. However, "terrestrially cosmic" creates register drift into academic diction, violating POV lexicon during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Heavy figurative muddle ("tranquil blaze," "terrestrially balanced energies") in high-pressure beats; template cadence ("As he..., the...") and paraphrase loops in the ritual sequence. Final-third artifacts (e.g., "serene and powerful—the perfect balance") disallow 9+ globally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Origami wing as prophecy vessel offers fresh synthesis, but "terrestrially cosmic" feels derivative of New Age tropes. Emotional specificity lacks depth—summoner's flawless execution avoids bold risk-taking, triggering Derivative Premise Guardrail (-0.7).</comment>
