<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation shift from "strange pull" to "sudden, clear purpose" lacks internal struggle showing contradictory impulses; micro-choices in research phase (text consultation, village questioning) redeem with concrete embodiment under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost in "they had not merely heard songs; they had remembered who they were"—reconfiguring community identity with conceptual cost of eroded heritage; causal lens holds through vine discovery to ritual.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Verdant arbor remains atmospheric backdrop without constraining choices (e.g., workbench location irrelevant to device creation); sensory details vivid but fail 9+ gate—environment doesn't charge final image beyond mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally through one meaningful escalation: visions reveal cultural erosion → race against harvest moon deadline; cost of forgotten knowledge made visceral in "slipping away like sand," though secondary pressure lacks development.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through song mechanics and village reactions; final dawn birdsong recharges opening arbor image with resonant non-literal answer to cultural loss without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "spun golden stories" motif, though filter verbs ("felt a strange pull") slightly dull immediacy in high-pressure beats; voice modulates effectively from whimsy to urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop in "pieced together the forgotten songs" dulls momentum; otherwise strong rhythm and specificity, but "strange pull" abstraction slightly muddles causal clarity in inciting incident.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Transforms "magical object" trope through song-based cultural mechanics, though harvest moon deadline feels conventional; specificity in vine's biological-magical hybridity elevates premise beyond template.</comment>
