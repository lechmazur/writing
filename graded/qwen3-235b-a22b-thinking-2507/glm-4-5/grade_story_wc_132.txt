<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong (rigid science vs. growing doubt) but pivotal change lacks sufficient struggle; micro-choices like opening vents reveal values, yet the metamorphosis feels slightly accelerated off-page between "weeks passed" and her decision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly under Accumulative lens—releasing control forecloses her old path with visible cost (destruction/growth)—but the "weeks passed" summary risks momentum loss despite anchoring in present via data collection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mossy trellis actively constrains choice (shoots emerging from wood) and charges the final image; sensory specificity ("dripping rainwater," "softened wood") embodies the theme without overt symbolism, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes (control vs. natural adaptation) tighten credibly under Accumulative pressure through failed interventions, but the destruction cost feels under-dramatized; agency in vent-opening choice reweights options with emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action (trellis shoots, vent decision) without moralizing; final line reframes the linden leaf as "unexpected teacher," offering resonant conceptual repricing of control without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (scientific precision blending with poetic observation) sustains under pressure; Marco’s "circuitously sincere" line modulates voice effectively, though "reluctant metamorphosis" slightly abstracts the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion ("doubled in size," "trembling hands"). Minor deduction for "her motivation had shifted" telling rather than showing, but final image avoids sentimentality through concrete setup.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms eco-trope via specific nursery mechanics (rain shields, soil composition); emotional truth in identity crisis elevates beyond surface novelty, though storm-season framing borders on familiar without deeper risk-taking.</comment>
