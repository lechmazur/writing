<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation "to teach dust to tell stories" is concrete and drives action, but lacks complicating flaws—protagonist's competence feels unearned despite danger. Micro-choices like embedding lyrics show value hierarchy, yet internal conflict remains under-dramatized beyond "thistled calm" veneer.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: dust dancing in moonlight crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost (risk of capture). Orientation clear by word 20 ("fingers stained with ink"), but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—pressure stays static as routine act, missing a live option foreclosure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dust particles function as micro-setting that constrains choice (embedding narratives) and charges the final image ("dust particles that seemed to dance"). Sensory details like ink-stained fingers and dial glow are selective and POV-filtered, though "hungry souls" slightly genericizes emotional specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (broadcasting vs. detection) signaled early but pressure never tightens—no narrowing of options or visible price paid during the scene. Risk remains abstract despite "work was dangerous" declaration; conceptual cost lacks on-page legibility at closure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through dust mechanics: final image of dancing particles reweights "story famine" without moralizing. Avoids false equivalence by showing authorities' oppression while focusing on dust's quiet rebellion—resonant answer to "how stories survive" via embodied action, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature via musical terms ("thistled calm," "ember alcove") and tactile details. Voice modulates effectively during broadcast ("voice barely above a whisper"), though "hungry souls" momentarily slips into generic phrasing. Consistent close-third POV with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong propulsion with concrete verbs ("transcribed," "swirled," "danced"), but "secretly luminous beacon" edges toward overwriting. No paraphrase loops; final line avoids sentimentality through "dust particles that seemed to dance." Minor register drift in "reawakening the imagination" slightly dilutes closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dust as storytelling medium transforms "resistance broadcast" trope through specific mechanics (bowls of water, sound frequencies). Emotional truth in "children had grown up without bedtime stories" avoids abstraction. Risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
