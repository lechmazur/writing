<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction absent; "improbable longing" stated as diagnostic label rather than embodied struggle. Woman's fear lacks specific contradiction—she merely trembles without active resistance. Final choice feels preordained, not earned through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves valid Charged Poise (ribbon transformation + whisper), but accumulation lacks meaningful pressure escalation. Ritual proceeds flawlessly without narrowing options or raising cost—the compass spin is decorative, not consequential. Lens ambiguity cap applies as accumulation fails to deepen stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Starlight and crossroads create vivid atmosphere, but setting never constrains choices. The "cool stone" briefly anchors Silas' action, yet micro-setting (hair/ribbon) doesn't charge the final image strongly enough for 9+ band. Sensory details remain observational, not tactical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freeing idea) is clear but never viscerally tested. Pressure dissolves when Silas' ritual succeeds perfectly—no trade-offs, tactical shifts, or narrowing options. The "fear" remains abstract; no felt cost emerges until the ribbon's dissolution, arriving too late to drive escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through hair-to-ribbon transformation, but final line "change the world" veers into thematic echo. Avoids moralizing until the end, where it states the idea's impact rather than showing its resonance. Conceptual cost (dissolved hair) is earned but undercut by over-assurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("indigo and lavender," "inked the sky") and rhythmic control shine, but "improbable longing" injects diagnostic label that breaks voice. Tension modulates well through compression ("space between heartbeats"), though minor register drift occurs in "revolutionary thought."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose flows with strong texture ("supernova" metaphor coherent), but scaffold weakens pivotal beats: "woman fierce in her intellect, trembling" labels instead of embodies. Final paragraph overwrites with "transformative, boundless, free," diluting the ribbon's quiet power. No fatal loops, but density falters at climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith motif with cosmic psychology feels inevitable. Bold risk in metaphysical premise heightens stakes without gimmickry—hair's dissolution embodies liberation uniquely. Avoids abstraction through specific mechanics (first star, three turns), making emotional truth resonate beyond trope.</comment>
