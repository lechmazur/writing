<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction lacks concrete micro-choices; "emptiness" remains abstract despite strong embodied phrases like "combative tenderness of yearning." Grandma's relic quote feels thematic scaffolding rather than character-driven memory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with "weight of her former self slipping away," but whale's summons resolves stakes externally rather than through Mara's agency, weakening causal pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Liquid moonlight" scrimshaw fragments charge the rebirth image beautifully, but sublittoral setting remains atmospheric backdrop—never constrains Mara's choices or alters tactics despite vivid mercury-water descriptions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freedom vs conformity) tightens through scrimshaw's evolving text, yet whale's intervention feels coincidental rather than earned escalation; Mara's dive lacks prior tactical shifts showing her agency narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</comment><comment>Avoids moralizing via "liberation in the arms of the disappearing island," though "true nature" phrasing risks abstraction; final image reweights "combative tenderness" into earned rebirth without stated morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in dock-worker grace ("fluid motion woven into fabric of her being"), but stress-response remains overly articulate during whale call climax without degradation of thought under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Heart a battlefield" followed by "combative tenderness" creates minor synonym loop; "salt sugar" simile is fresh but slightly jarring—no major artifacts dulling the potent closure image of dissolving scrimshaw.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "after violence impossible" context with mythic island, but "true nature" theme lacks non-obvious inflection; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
