<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (mild obsession vs violent determination) drives the pivotal comprehension beat; embodied cost in trembling booklet and shifted values when sketching voids instead of boundaries. Only minor flaw: slightly over-articulated "darkness as canvas" insight lacks sufficient struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with cost (her realization forecloses prevention path), but textural accumulation lacks causal escalation; one distinct issue (recurring darkness imagery without deepening pressure) triggers -0.8 cap. Anchors established by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting of pebbles constrains choices (placing flesh-warm stone alters perception) and charges closure (glowing booklet); environment narrows perception during crisis via "ambered hush" focus. Lacks weather's tangible impact on tactics beyond symbolic backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: star's disappearance changes knowledge (darkness inevitable), forcing stance crystallization. Cost is visceral in "booklet trembled" as she accepts guidance over prevention. Pressure tightens through sensory density without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (pebbles, void-sketching), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights darkness as canvas. Borderline thematic echo in margin note ("map leads through silence") risks didacticism but is embedded in action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ambered hush," "marbled silence") with rhythmic control under pressure; voice modulates from "profound silence" to "living presence." Minor register slip: "violently determined" feels slightly clinical for her lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; only paraphrase loop ("fingers tracing... fingers moved") and borderline mixed metaphor ("profound silence and whispers") trigger -0.3. Figurative language serves pressure without muddle, especially in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms prophecy trope through "summarizing silence" inflection; specific pebble details (flesh-warm stone) create emotional truth. Avoids abstraction while risking lyric density—darkness as canvas feels earned through prior particulars.</comment>
