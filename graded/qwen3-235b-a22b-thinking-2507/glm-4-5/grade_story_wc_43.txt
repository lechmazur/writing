<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Therapist's "decisively kind" presence avoids saccharine tropes through embodied micro-choices (playing louder to honor silence), but interior contradiction feels underexplored beyond stated serenity; son's "I'll fix it" reveals authentic generational tension with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: son holding the fragment as "holy relic" crystallizes the unfixable loss while the final line reconfigures love as "space between notes"; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the vinyl fragment constrains every key choice (placement, playing, son's reception) and charges the final image; "scent of hope" evolves from lavender/cedar into embodied stakes as therapist notes it "more powerful than medication" during transition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (flawless goodbye without tears) tightens meaningfully when son's "I'll fix it" promise collides with collective knowledge of impending death, narrowing options to silent acceptance; cost is the unbearable weight of unspoken grief in the "pulsing stillness".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through visceral particulars: "hymning the mundane" reframes refrigerator hum as resistance against despair, culminating in the final line's resonant answer—love lives not in wholeness but "the space between notes"—avoiding moralizing while charging closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "pulsing stillness" motif and therapist's selective attention to scent/chair arrangement, but "serene" descriptor risks abstraction; rhythmic control under pressure (guitar volume shifts) compensates for minimal POV contradiction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "blood work came back yesterday" compresses backstory efficiently, though "scent of hope" slightly strains abstraction in high-pressure beat; zero loops, but final paragraph's lyrical density risks overwriting without pattern-teaching payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms hospice tropes through specific verisimilitude (vinyl fragment as emotional conduit) and bold risk: quiet ending where "ordinary magic" emerges from mundane details, avoiding sentimentality via "flawless in its imperfection" reconfiguration of closure.</comment>
