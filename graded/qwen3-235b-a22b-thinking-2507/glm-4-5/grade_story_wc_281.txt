<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("affectionate skeptic") shown through embodied choices like heart-rate sync with geode, but brother's backstory remains told motivation without on-page cost manifestation. Diagnostic "synaptic chaos" label slightly breaches POV lexicon during crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as Maya becomes "a believer" with geode against her heart, but brother's suffering ("trapped in his own mind") lacks concrete on-page cost evidence. Accumulative lens holds through fractal pattern density build-up.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Light painting studio functions as active micro-setting: cameras/lights constrain tactics (capturing "minute fluctuations"), and final image charges closure. "Willowglass hope" ornamental phrase slightly dilutes environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes (healing pill victims) tighten via neural network light patterns, but escalation leans on passive geode behavior ("began to vibrate") rather than Maya's agency. Static shock as catalyst risks coincidence-under-accumulative-lens tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through fractal patterns reweighting "human spirit" healing, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("smallest things hold power to mend") edges toward sentimentality but redeemed by concrete geode-in-hand physicality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fractally precise," somatic markers) modulates under pressure, but "synaptic chaos" clinical term breaks Maya's plausible lexicon. Consistent psychic distance with purposeful compression in reflection fragments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Template cadence in final paragraphs ("Maya carefully documented... Maya carefully packed") creates minor momentum drag. High density in geode descriptions compensates, but "defied conventional physics" risks figurative muddle near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neurology and crystal mysticism via somatic markers avoids trope pitfalls. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes, though "telepathy pill" premise requires lived detail to overcome derivative guardrail.</comment>
