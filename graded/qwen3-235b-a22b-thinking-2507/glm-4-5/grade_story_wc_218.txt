<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "brazen calm" amid bodily protest; micro-choices like turning to the orchid page crystallize motivation. No diagnostic labels—arthritis flare and trembling fingers embody struggle. Final choice earns closure through prior causality (diary study → precise wire work).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: heartbeat syncing to pillar light. Accumulative lens holds via monthly deepening (dreaming patterns → off-season blooms). Orientation clear by paragraph one; cost legible in "exhausted yet profoundly peaceful" as life force merges with orchard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Living stone pillars constrain choices (wire patterns must mirror constellations) and charge closure via synchronized breathing/light. Copper wire functions as micro-setting—"metal singing against wood" becomes a language. Sensory details (iridescent orchid, off-season blooms) serve urgency without checklist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (time vs. purpose) tightens through Elias' agency: monthly deepening narrows options to final circuit completion. Cost visible in bodily decline ("strength waned") and heartbeat synchronization. Escalation under Accumulative lens flawless until month-five whispers slightly soften pressure before climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—copper wire as language—not moralizing. Final image ("leaves that would now communicate") offers resonant answer to "interspecies respect" without stating a moral. Avoids thematic echo; even named concept stays dramatized through struggle ("learning to speak it").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: botanist’s precision ("geometric patterns mirroring constellations") modulates to lyrical under duress ("symphony of light"). Rhythmic control peaks in climax—short clauses ("Exhausted yet profoundly peaceful") contrast flowing closure. Only flaw: "brazen calm" repetition lacks embodied variation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion through strategic compression ("For the first month... By the third month"). Final line recharges "six months" motif with "hands yet unborn." Hairline slip: "gently systematic" appears verbatim twice without variation, costing 0.1 despite no closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms eco-fiction tropes via specific mechanics (copper wire as language, constellations as blueprint). Risk distinction: death as connection catalyst avoids sentimentality. Emotional truth in pairing mortality with purpose ("deadline for purpose"). "Whispers on wind" slightly derivative but redeemed by earned payoff.</comment>
