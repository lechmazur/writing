<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("broken in ways no craft could mend") without sufficient contradictory impulses in action; final choice earned but emotional progression lacks layered irrationality during unraveling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "interlaced hush deepened into profound stillness" crystallizes cost with spirits settling and Elena's subtle shift; Accumulative lens holds through knot unraveling density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary constrains choice (light bending from spirits) and charges final image ("mended masks" patterns); starlight actively shapes action via "fractured rainbows" reflecting fragmentation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through knot unraveling (one meaningful deepening), but cost remains conceptual; "profound stillness" lacks visceral weight to fully charge final image per 8.8+ band guardrails.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through net unraveling particulars; "A secret isn't meant to be kept forever" avoids thematic echo by being character dialogue, not moralizing, with final image reweighting silence as gift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in light/silence observations; rhythmic control falters slightly in "lucid unrest" repetition, but elision of Jacob's secret is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in climax ("lucid unrest that had haunted this place transformed into something resembling peace"); strong propulsion otherwise, but "fractured rainbows" metaphor risks slight abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mask restoration with spirit-work; "accumulated silence" attribute transforms trope through specific mechanics, though risk-taking stops short of full conceptual boldness.</comment>
