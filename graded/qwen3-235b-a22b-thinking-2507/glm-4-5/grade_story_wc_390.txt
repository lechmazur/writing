<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("logically emotional") drives key micro-choices like tracing carvings while panic warred; embodied cost in "forever changed" forecloses safety with visible conceptual burden.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: drifting boat and "forever changed" crystallize eternal burden under causal lens; stakes tighten via footsteps-to-fork sequence with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina pressures urgency through cracking sounds mirroring intruder proximity, but micro-setting (key/orb glow) constrains ritual execution and charges final image with azure coat resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally from key vibration to footsteps to deafening tone; cost crystallizes in "forever changed" with conceptual price of eternal vigilance narrowing all future options under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "fleshly ethereal" mechanics, not moralizing; final ascent reweights duty as non-literal answer to "logic vs legacy" without stating moral, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Engineer’s perceptual signature shines in vibration-focused noticing; rhythmic control shifts from lyrical sunset to staccato "Outside, footsteps echoed" under stress without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "crunch of frozen seaweed" and "cracked like distant bones" exemplify high-density propulsion. Slight overwriting risk in "numinous" offset by earned specificity in tuning fork mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse trope via vibrational physics; "sonic absolution" feels inevitable through sonar/foghorn expertise. Fresh inflection in "fleshly ethereal" lock merging mechanics and spirit.</comment>
