<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong in "victimized to survivor" shift, but "fragile convictions" borders on label-speak; micro-choices like observing chameleon's color shift earn the epiphany without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "reconstruction was possible" crystallizes her stance after the betrayal, with the chameleon's healed tail tip making the cost visceral in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Workshop functions as micro-setting through the chameleon's enclosure and condensation drips; the tail tip's physical evolution directly charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate for environment constraining thematic closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's internal pressure alone—"three days since the con" creates urgency—but escalation lacks external constraint; her whispered realization drives the deepening under Accumulative lens with felt cost in "wounded spirit" parallel.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing by letting the chameleon's shedding reweight "reconstruction" as transformation; final image of it disappearing into foliage offers non-literal resolution to trust's fragility without stating a theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in wildlife-handler details ("microscopic scales," "ancient DNA"); psychic distance holds perfectly though whispered dialogue stays overly articulate under stress, slightly flattening emotional texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>No closure artifacts, but "quietly vivid" and "fragile convictions" risk generic phrasing; minor synonym churn in "shimmering stillness" descriptions (-0.4 per text-artifact policy) caps high-band entry.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of betrayal recovery through reptilian biology; chameleon's tail tip as parallel to human healing avoids tropes, though "misty workshop under stars" leans familiar. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
