<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in locket and adaptive philosophy, but Lila's muteness breakthrough lacks contradictory impulses; "recognizing herself in Lila" borders on diagnostic label-speak during pivotal climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with visible cost ("fragile but real, like a newly opened flower"), yet eclipse resolution leans slightly on coincidence rather than Maya's causal agency narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sage ridge functions as micro-setting through aromatic sentinels and locket's final touch, charging closure image; however, geography doesn't constrain choices beyond providing eclipse vantage point.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Lila's muteness) escalates via eclipse timing, but pressure lacks protagonist-driven narrowing; resolution hinges on celestial event rather than Maya's tactical choices under coherent causal escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Ordinary magic" theme emerges through drumming/locket particulars without moralizing; final whisper reweights darkness/light metaphor into resonant, non-literal answer about cyclical hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in musical metaphors ("sanctuary of sound"), but peak stress syntax remains lyrical rather than compressing under pressure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Minor metaphor clash ("resilience wasn't about strength but flexibility, bending without breaking like sagebrush"); otherwise clean propulsion with zero loops, though "cautious exuberance" edges toward therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms therapy trope through specific locket/sage details; emotional truth in fragility of breakthrough feels earned, though eclipse catalyst risks proximity to familiar trauma-recovery templates.</comment>
