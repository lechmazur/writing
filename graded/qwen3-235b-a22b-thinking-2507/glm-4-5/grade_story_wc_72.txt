<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction lacks concrete embodiment; diver's academic rigidity shown only through "reeling" without specific micro-choices. Statue's "incisively kind" trait remains stated rather than demonstrated through action tradeoffs under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis succeeds with diver's nod signifying abandoned certainty, but cost remains implied rather than legible on-page. Orientation clear by para 1, yet pressure escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening—revelations cascade passively from statue.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choices: diver must descend physically/emotionally, while silt motif evolves from preservation to symbol of new understanding. Bioluminescent corals and ampoule shadows charge the final image with tangible cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certainty vs nuance) signaled early but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the diver receives revelations rather than driving deepening. No visible price paid during key beats; pressure remains intellectual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through ampoule's shifting liquid and fish patterns mirroring complexity. Final image of diver carrying "better questions" reweights hubris without moralizing, avoiding Thematic Echo penalties in the resonant closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature evident in statue's "distant chimes" telepathy, but diver's academic POV lacks specialized bias in noticing. Voice modulates effectively under pressure though internal lexicon remains generically intellectual during crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythm purposefully ("Tiny fish darted... creating patterns"). Figurative language stays concrete and pressure-driven, though "incisively kind" slightly elevates diction beyond diver's plausible lexicon in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Tropes transformed via ampoule's foxglove stain and bioluminescent corals, yet "technological hubris destroys utopia" premise feels familiar. Emotional specificity in diver's academic unraveling lifts it from template, but lacks bold structural risk.</comment>
