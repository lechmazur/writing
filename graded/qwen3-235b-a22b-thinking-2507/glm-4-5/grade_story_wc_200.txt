<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; Elias's competence overshadows struggle with sister's trauma. "Luminous ache" motif shows embodied emotion but final choice lacks earned renunciation cost. Thomas's fear of forgetting laughter is poignant but underdeveloped in interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (joy replacing ache), but crocodile tooth's proximity signal feels coincidental rather than causal escalation. Hidden sunrise timeframe weakens temporal pressure despite strong Earned Stasis reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Echo Gorge's sonic properties constrain choices (harp notes guiding direction) and charge the final image. Misaligned harp functions as micro-setting that shapes tactics, though "hidden sunrise" lacks live-clock pressure on decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes (freeing Thomas via laughter) deepen emotionally but lack tangible escalation; Elias faces no opposition beyond Thomas's fear. Cost is felt (ache transforming to joy) yet agency remains passive—resolution hinges on bell's magic rather than earned choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the bell's chime crystallizing laughter as liberation, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "luminous ache" into joy without stating the lesson, achieving Conceptual Repricing with undeniable emotional cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sonic distortions," "luminous ache") modulates with pressure, though filter verbs ("he felt") slightly dull immediacy during Thomas's confession. Voice remains consistent and character-particular throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "crystallizing in the air like visible joy" creates metaphor muddle. Otherwise, high density with rhythmic propulsion; "dissolved into shimmering light" avoids cliché through prior motif integration. No closure-impacting artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms soul-collector trope through sonic mechanics and laughter-as-healing. Risks poetic abstraction but grounds innovation in Thomas's specific fear of forgetting joy. Derivative elements (cave confrontation) redeemed by luminous ache's emotional specificity.</comment>
