<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction under pressure is underdeveloped until abrupt climax; "fear of ruling" realization lacks prior embodied struggle. Epiphany feels unearned by causality despite strong embodied emotion in library decay sequences.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure (Conceptual Repricing) lands with conceptual cost but "burden of expectation" remains abstract; no exact on-page line makes cost legible. Lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural shifting to Causal at climax) weakens escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: iron gall ink pellet constrains choice (communication method) and charges final image ("dissolved into light"). Library's physical decay lacks tactical integration until collapse, missing constraint potential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative pressure via urgent messages and library collapse narrows options effectively. Protagonist agency weakens escalation—resolution stems from external messages, not her choices—diminishing cost legibility despite strong dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through ink's "memory of what once was" and bleeding messages; final image ("destiny not written in stars but chosen") reweights pretender hunt without moralizing. Slight abstraction in "burden of expectation" prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("false stars wheeled overhead") shines, but "regally unpretentious" diction drifts into thematic label-speak. Lyrical compression works until climax, where elevated register clashes with intimate POV during self-realization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; high density with "dust motes danced in increasingly erratic patterns" charging atmosphere. Minor overwriting in collapse sequence ("shelves crumbled into dust while books dissolved") slightly dulls momentum without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library motif with psychological revelation avoids cliché ("pretender is fear of ruling"). Derivative premise guardrail avoided through specific ink mechanics, though internal-foe trope lacks full transformation. Risk-taking elevates stakes coherently.</comment>
