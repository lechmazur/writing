<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses; Elena's "spirited" trait remains abstract without embodied struggle during vision sequence. No visible cost to her "perpetually learning" approach when handling the magic lantern slide.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("GPS remained dead... no longer needed it"), but the Accumulative lens weakens escalation—visions accumulate without narrowing options or raising stakes meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Storm-tossed archway and turbine hum create vivid atmosphere, but neither constrains choices; driftwood selection lacks tactile specificity ("layered meanings" remains abstract rather than guiding concrete actions).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (artistic inspiration) tightens through vision sequence, but pressure lacks agency-driven escalation; Elena's passive reception of visions undercuts meaningful trade-offs or tactical shifts under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Final moralizing ("simplicity can indeed scaffold...") violates organic emergence; "timewoven alliances" is repeatedly stated as theme rather than earned through struggle, triggering thematic echo penalty in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in coastal details, but "turbine-hum reverie" becomes repetitive tic; voice modulates well until final paragraph's thematic overstatement disrupts consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity in opening, but scaffold appears in explanatory interiority ("Elena, being perpetually learning, recognized...") and synonym churn around "reimagine" weakens propulsion in middle beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Time-portal trope lacks fresh inflection; "magic lantern slide" feels derivative despite coastal specificity. Emotional truth in artistic process is overshadowed by thematic convenience of "timewoven alliances."</comment>
