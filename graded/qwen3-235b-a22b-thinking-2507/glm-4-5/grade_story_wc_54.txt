<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses during repair; epiphany about hope-navigation emerges without prior struggle or visible tradeoffs. Motivation clear but internal conflict remains abstract rather than embodied in key beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with conceptual cost (reweighted meaning of navigation), but sextant's sudden equation revelation feels convenient. Causal chain holds though payoff slightly overreaches with "coordinates speaking directly to her project".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Terminal setting actively constrains choices (corroded circuits, dormant transformers) and the sextant charges the final image. Micro-setting functions as environment with tactile, lived-in details like "brass surface still gleaming despite neglect".</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Maya's agency rerouting circuits under causal lens; visible cost in conceptual weight of journeys. One meaningful escalation (dormant transformers → flickering lights) with pressure coherently narrowing options via technical struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through sextant/terminal metaphors without moralizing. Final image reweights "navigation" beyond space to hope itself, but epiphany slightly overstates with "tool for navigation through hope itself" bordering on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct engineer perceptual signature ("corroded circuits", "redirected flows") with rhythmic control. Voice modulates from "stoic determination" to "eyes alight" without POV slippage, though "functionally creative" repetition slightly dulls specificity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("maze of intentions" x3 without evolution) and label repetition ("functionally creative") create subtle scaffold. Otherwise clean propulsion with concrete verbs, but nominalizations like "resurrection" slightly soften peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of engineering and hope metaphors elevates trope. "Maze of intentions" transforms abandoned-spaceport cliché through specific stakes, though carnival timeframe feels underutilized for emotional risk-taking.</comment>
