<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows tactical micro-choices (dipping brush, layering loops) but lacks contradictory impulses during climax; Sarah remains purely a vessel without individual traits despite high stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Sarah's gasping recovery and fading symbols reconfigure the "unraveled stillness" with visible cost (priest's exhaustion), perfectly executing the Accumulative/Textural lens through sonic architecture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Indigo palette and loop pedal function as micro-setting that charges the final image; symbols' flaring directly constrains the entity's dissolution, transforming paint from tool to active barrier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through priest's agency—each added loop pedal layer escalates pressure, forcing the entity's faltering with conceptual cost (pride exposed by paradox question), though Sarah's suffering lacks visceral specificity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "silence that precedes creation" motif evolves from oppressive weight to redemptive space without moralizing; final line "acknowledged darkness while affirming light" reweights prior struggle with earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (sound/color focus) sustains under pressure, but "unraveled stillness" repetition creates scaffolding; voice modulates effectively from tremulous to resonant during incantation buildup.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loop in "unraveled stillness" (repeated verbatim 3x) and "plumb the depths" redundancy dull momentum; otherwise crisp propulsion with strong verbs ("writhed," "flared," "dissolve") supporting Accumulative escalation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of loop pedals as sacred tools transforms exorcism tropes; specificity of indigo's light-absorbing property and sonic architecture creates organic originality without gimmickry, heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
