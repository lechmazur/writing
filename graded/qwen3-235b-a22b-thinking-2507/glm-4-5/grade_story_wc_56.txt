<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak but lacks contradictory impulses; micro-choices under pressure are minimal beyond journal retrieval. Flaws don't compound meaningfully before resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("serene upheaval" reweights truth architecture), but lens ambiguity (Accumulative vs. Causal) weakens causality at climax. Orientation test passed early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Barge canal functions as micro-setting: sagging hull pressures her steps, journal hidden under rotted boards constrains discovery. Sundial's brass warmth charges final image, though environmental specificity occasionally drifts generic ("humid air").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering historical lies) tightens through journal discovery, but escalation lacks visceral pressure; cost remains conceptual ("turbulent implications") without tangible forfeiture. Agency driven by discovery, not active choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sundial metaphor ("perspective changes everything") and "architecture of lies," avoiding moralizing. Final image ("navigate the twilight") resonates non-literally with conceptual cost, though "serene upheaval" edges toward label.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice modulates effectively ("waterway had been her grandfather's last known location"), but filter verbs ("she felt closer") and uniform tics ("by training instincts") dilute perceptual signature under stress. No dialogue present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose avoids major loops, but "serene upheaval" and "thoughtfully clear precision" suffer abstract telling. Strategic telling compresses backstory, though "hindsight clarity had finally arrived" weakens momentum in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "architecture of lies" with physical salvage work; specific barge details ground universals. Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off, though "errant legend seeker" trope lacks full transformation beyond premise.</comment>
