<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Wisely adventurous" stated not shown; renunciation earned but emotional contradiction thin despite strong closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal escalation to Earned Stasis closure flawless; sunrise deadline creates clean narrowing of options with visible cost in throne activation timing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid retro-futurist details lack constraint on choices; orchard's digital fruits don't alter tactics despite beautiful atmospheric cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (beat sunrise) tightens effectively but cost remains abstract; no tangible loss if ritual fails beyond thematic weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "proper return of power" motif; final image of Elara's smile charges prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Consistent perceptual signature (artifact-focused POV) with rhythmic control; no head-hopping but stress compression lacks distinct voice modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold loops ("pulsed with ancient energy dormant for generations"); strong propulsion but "holographic overlay" slightly muddles physicality in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Retro-futurist synthesis feels fresh yet throne trope limits risk; "futuristic nostalgia" execution specific but premise not transformed beyond setting.</comment>
