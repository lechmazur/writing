<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; epiphany feels earned yet untested by active struggle ("knowing the answer... time had passed" avoids tangible cost).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with folded atlas symbolizing acceptance, but cost remains conceptual ("time had passed") without visceral legibility; lens (Accumulative) holds yet escalation lacks meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Monitoring station constrains choice through rhythmic tapping and data cross-referencing; "torn atlas bleeding into digital coastlines" charges final image with environmental specificity and tactile decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes (vanishing paths) deepen via atlas/satellite comparison, but escalation relies on sudden realization after sleepless night rather than protagonist-driven pressure; cost stays abstract without tactical alteration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "periodically eternal" cycles and atlas decay; final image ("sea held secrets close") reweights premise without moralizing, though "rebirth" phrasing edges toward sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("data danced like schools of fish") with rhythmic control; tapping motif modulates tension, though "delayed revelation" exposition breaks POV plausibility in peak moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in closure beat, but adjacent paraphrase loops ("renewing vibrant colors... transformed in ways") trigger -0.2; lyrical density elevates momentum yet "periodically eternal" repetition dulls cadence shift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of climate grief through atlas decay and rhythmic observation; avoids eco-parable clichés via specific coral witness lens, though "rebirth" framing slightly softens emotional risk.</comment>
