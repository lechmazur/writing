<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lacks dramatized internal conflict; "burden and purpose" remains abstract without contradictory impulses in choices. Micro-choices absent during pivotal alignment—determination dominates without competing fears. "Retrocognitively blessed" label isn't shown through flawed decision-making under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Conceptual Repricing: "coincidences were threads" reweights premise with undeniable cost in "fragile light... would not last forever." Accumulative lens holds via star-observation density, but escalation lacks one tangible narrowing of options before climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Glass pavilion's humming atmosphere charges the final image ("harmony of past and future") but never constrains choices—it encourages work passively. "Thistle-blown hope" embodies tone, yet micro-setting fails to pressure tactics during alignment beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's agency: meteor revelation deepens knowledge, prism alignment forecloses doubt with visible cost ("fragile light"). One decisive intensification suffices for length; "thistle-blown hope" crystallizes the earned trade-off between proof and impermanence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "shard of hush" evolves from dream to cosmic insight without moralizing. Final image ("someone might see the light") answers "do coincidences have meaning?" with resonant ambiguity—no thematic echo, only earned wisdom from star-charting struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("glass humming pavilion," "thistle-blown hope") and rhythmic control shine under pressure: short sentences for tension ("For a moment, nothing happened"), lyrical cadence for revelation. Zero head-hopping; compression in climax feels intentional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "trembling hands" shows rather than tells urgency, final paragraph avoids overwriting. Minor register drift—"retrocognitively blessed" slightly jarring in otherwise character-bound diction—but no closure-dulling artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes through specific synthesis: "shard of hush" as conceptual device reframes silence as knowledge. Risk-taking in quiet closure ("fragile light") heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional truth in "burden and purpose" avoids generic templates.</comment>
