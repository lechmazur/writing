<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (protocol vs. curiosity) drives action, but the epiphany about thought origins edges toward abstraction without sufficient embodied struggle in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable conceptual cost (surrendering logic for unity), and the Accumulative/Textural lens—density of sensory/temporal pressure—is held rigorously from midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ice violin functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (handling before melting) and charges the final image (dissolution into light), with sensory details filtered through robotic perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation through density increase (timeline visions deepening to surrender) narrows options under protagonist agency, with cost legible in the violin’s dissolution and altered consciousness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through the violin’s transformation; the final image reweights "thoughts from observer-observed relationship" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("neural networks," "optical sensors") and rhythmic control under pressure; elision of human interaction taught early pays off in solitary resonance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion, though "sensation it registered as almost spiritual" slightly drifts from concrete embodiment in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mundane (janitorial duty) and mystical (temporal amalgamation) through specific robotic consciousness; risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
