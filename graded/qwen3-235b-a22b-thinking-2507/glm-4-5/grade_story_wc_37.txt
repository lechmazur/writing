<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear motivation but lacks interior contradiction; "bound release" functions as diagnostic label-speak in peak beats (-0.5), weakening earned change despite strong embodied action during swaddling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with legible cost ("scattered pieces draw closer to alignment"), but lens ambiguity persists past midpoint; Accumulative/Textural drive holds through final tapestry yet lacks persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (swaddling starlight saplings), with mica window's evolving reflections charging the final image; sensory details like "gossamer threads spun from recollections" perfectly filter through keeper's urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindling realm) tightens through keeper's accelerating swaddling, but escalation lacks visible price paid mid-scene; cost remains conceptual until closure, weakening pressure legibility under Accumulative lens despite strong final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "woven dawns" as social fabric, avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "bound release" as communal connection without stated moral, though "threads that knits communities" slightly edges toward label-speak in penultimate paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("fragments of light that never quite dawned"), with rhythmic control intensifying during humming; zero POV drift despite lyrical compression, though "bound release" terminology slightly violates keeper's plausible lexicon in high-stress moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops but adjacent synonym churn ("remembered colors"/"knew daylight") triggers -0.2; exceptional density in closure ("brilliant tapestry of dawn") though "phosphorescent flora pulsing" slightly overwrites in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Transforms memory-keeper trope through alchemical swaddling action; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes, but "mirror world" concept lacks fresh inflection beyond standard shadow-realm tropes despite strong integration.</comment>
