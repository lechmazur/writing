<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>No visible cost of Esme's choice; triumph lacks trade-off despite strong contradictory impulses ("warning chimes of sanity" vs. obsession). "Bleak exhilaration" vanishes without embodied consequence, violating Earned Stasis requirement for this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly but cost proof test fails: "world would never run same direction" states change without dramatizing price. Closure image lacks legible consequence despite strong tide-pressure escalation ("narrow window of possibility").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hunger stone's tide constraint and yoyo mechanism charge closure ("fluid potential waiting for direction"), but lighthouse remains ornamental setting despite final "bridge" metaphor. Micro-setting excels; secondary element underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via tide window ("slow exhale of low tide") and puzzle resistance, yet resolution lacks visible price. Agency drives escalation (reverse-spin triggers shift), but "pure wonder" finale obscures cost required for 8.8+ band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: final image ("world would never run same direction") reweights "fixed construct" without moralizing. "Latent radiance" metaphor earns resonance via prior puzzle struggle, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct "counter-clockwise" perceptual signature shines ("time was not a river... but a choice"), but "neatly inventive mind" borders on clinical articulation mid-crisis. Rhythmic control under pressure nearly flawless.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density, but "bleak exhilaration surged through her veins" strains in high-pressure beat. Final line ("world would never run...") achieves perfect propulsion; minor figurative muddle prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: hunger stone myth transformed through clockmaker's reverse-engineering lens. "Yoyo as fate-key" feels inevitable in hindsight; bold risk elevates stakes without gimmickry ("tailored to her counter-clockwise nature").</comment>
