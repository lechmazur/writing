<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in concrete action (tracing wet stone, humming) avoids abstraction, but "spirit soared" edges toward label; contradictory impulses (yearning for possibilities vs melancholy of separation) earn closure with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orientation clear by paragraph 1; Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds toward Charged Poise closure; cost ("familiar melancholy") legible in final separation beat despite slight backstory detachment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prism parapet actively constrains magic (rain amplifies resonance) and charges closure via "single plain wall" reprise; sensory details (glistening droplets, fractured reflections) evolve causally with plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (showing possibilities before noon) tighten under time pressure; agency in humming ritual deepens connection, but visceral urgency of loss could be sharper beyond melancholy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images (rainbows, fragmented selves), not abstraction; final "single plain wall" reweights possibility with undeniable conceptual cost, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (light refraction, sound resonance) with rhythmic control; "dusky harmony" cadence shifts under pressure, no POV leakage or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("prism caught her movements, fracturing her image"); "spirit soared" is sole abstraction in peak beat, but final line ("vanished... until spring") recharges motifs flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "borrowed heartbeat" with terrace and lullabies transforms mirror tropes; emotional specificity in melancholy after wonder avoids generic magic realism.</comment>
