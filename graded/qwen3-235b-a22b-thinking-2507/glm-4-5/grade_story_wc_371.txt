<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Eliza's interiority shines through embodied contradiction ("bread tasted different now, like forgiveness") and micro-choices like breaking bread during revelation. However, secondary pressure is absent without another character on page, limiting relationship-as-crucible depth despite strong guilt-to-absolution arc rooted in prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when Eliza leaves bread for others, reconfiguring the bakery's sacrifice into shared comfort with felt cost ("tenuous absolution settling over her guilt"). Orientation anchors by paragraph 2, and accumulative/lyric lens holds cohesively through sensory density to the resonant final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tea house and guerrilla garden constrain choices (steeping herbs, sheltering during rain) and charge the final image of thriving plants. Specific details like "wax paper imprinted with 'Sweet Morning'" and mint pushing through flagstones avoid white-room syndrome while mirroring Eliza's thematic focus on persistence in decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten accumulatively as the bread's scent and rain pressure Eliza toward reading the letter, transforming abstract guilt into visceral absolution. The cost—"something shifted within her"—is legible when she reconfigures her mission from uncovering truth to sharing forgiveness, driven entirely by her agency under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the bread evolves from "memories of yeast" to "forgiveness meant to be shared," avoiding moralizing. Final image of guerrilla garden thriving reweights "sacred in ordinary things" as active practice, not abstraction, with no thematic echo despite high conceptual resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("creeping normality noticer" observing "wild sages pushing through cracked flagstones") modulates rhythm effectively during rain's "drumming" and revelation. But "heuristically gentle" jars as uncharacteristic academic diction in an otherwise cohesive voice calibrated to Eliza's quiet intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Minor synonym loops ("vanished bakery" x4) and slight over-explanation in final paragraph ("testament to how small, persistent actions...") dull momentum. No artifacts in closure beat, but "time moved differently" and "creeping normality noticer" adjacent repetition creates subtle scaffold in early pressure sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of urban decay through the "normality noticer" lens avoids tropes via specific, verifiable details (wax paper imprint, guerrilla gardening). Emotional truth anchors the absolution arc in concrete action (leaving bread) rather than epiphany, with risk-taking in quiet accumulative structure heightening stakes.</comment>
