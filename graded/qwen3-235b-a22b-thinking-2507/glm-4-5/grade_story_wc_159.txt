<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority relies on poetic labels ("foxglove regret") rather than embodied contradiction; emotional progression feels elegiac but tidy. Diagnostic phrasing in peak beat ("heart clenched with foxglove regret") triggers -0.5 penalty despite strong motivation clarity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable cost: restored names ("Xylos. Thalia. Maran.") momentarily defy oblivion while final lines cement "all things eventually drift into obscurity." Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation (crack discovery → light-beam focus).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Opal library actively constrains choices (transparent floors demand delicate movement) and charges closure via "cloud-mist below" mirroring inevitable forgetting. Glass orchids recur purposefully—initially capturing light, later embodying Eleth's tears—meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes ("how many names had already slipped into oblivion?") tighten through Eleth's agency: selecting the song, focusing light. Cost crystallizes in "tears that felt like tiny glass orchids unfurling," charging the final image under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—bamboo tube's crack representing erasure—not moralizing. Final image ("each name a victory worth the foxglove regret") reweights preservation's cost without stating a thesis, passing Q5 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Eleth notices via preservation ("fingers brushing spines," "cradling shattered soul"). Rhythmic control excels during repair ("notes colliding like dust motes") with taught compression paying off in light-beam focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: zero loops/scaffold, high density ("resonated with forgotten names" → "melodies evaporated like dew"). "Tears like tiny glass orchids unfurling" avoids figurative muddle; only minor label ("foxglove regret") in Q1 context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms library tropes through specific mechanics: wind chimes as sonic memory vessels, light-as-adhesive requiring song. Emotional truth in "foxglove regret" elevates beyond surface novelty; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes.</comment>
