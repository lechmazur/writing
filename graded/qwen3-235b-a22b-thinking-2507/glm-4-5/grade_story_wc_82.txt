<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority leans poetic over embodied; "grief luminous in torment" lacks specific contradiction in action. Final release earned but micro-struggles under polishing feel summary-like despite strong core motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: lantern's ascent crystallizes emotional reconfiguration with tears as visceral cost. Accumulative lens holds throughout—density increase in memory flooding during polishing tightens stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Gems function as micro-setting charging closure (pulsing heart-shaped gem ascent), but tea garden remains postcard backdrop. Basilica's paradoxical architecture noted but unused beyond description; tool constraint elevates without full environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation (fluorescing gems' "dancing shadows") not external pressure. One tightening suffices at this length: lantern completion forces the basilica journey. Cost legible in "tears of relief and sorrow," though escalation lacks visceral mid-beat tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through origami cranes' evolution from "vessels of hope" to final "beacon," avoiding moralizing. The luminous torment reprised as transformed hope in last line reweights grief's cost without abstraction—pure subtextual resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("precision of a surgeon," "symphony of blossoms") with rhythmic control in closure. Minor register drift in "ethereal substance of dreams" slightly jars artisan POV, but compression remains purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with vivid specificity ("amber and gold" light), but paraphrase loop in "grief was still raw, still luminous in torment" slightly dulls momentum. No closure artifacts; final line's "surrounded by gems yet to be polished" exemplifies charged concision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of origami grief-processing within floating isle framework avoids trope through tactile details (heart-shaped gem's pulse). Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens emotional truth, though basilica concept edges toward familiar magical realism.</comment>
