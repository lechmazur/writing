<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("wistfully pragmatic" heart driving hopeful action) earns final choice; embodied emotion avoids labels. Slight flaw: Jim's recognition feels convenient but doesn't break causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes purpose with felt cost of legacy ("hours passed, dawn approached"). Orientation clear by line 3, but cost proof slightly soft—no visible physical toll beyond temporal weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Harbor's moonlight constrains light-reflection method; bitting gauge's physical properties charge the final image. "Liquid mercury" slightly generic but offset by tactile boat/alcove details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (continuing grandmother's legacy) tightens via Mara's agency reflecting light. Cost legible in temporal expenditure ("hours passed"), but moral calculus lacks sharper tradeoffs for full high-band entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through refracted light as legacy metaphor—no moralizing. Final image reweights "dark corners" as solvable through inherited tools, avoiding sentimentality via concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (gardener's precision meets lockmaster's pragmatism) modulates under pressure. Minor filter verbs ("she remembered") and slight register drift in harbor description prevent 8.8+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong propulsion but "wistfully pragmatic heart ache" risks label-speak; template cadence in harbor description ("water shimmered... masts swayed"). No closure artifacts, but minor loops cap high-band entry.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lockmaster/gardener legacies through bitting gauge. Risk-taking in quiet resolution earns distinction, but "reflect light" trope slightly familiar despite specific execution.</comment>
