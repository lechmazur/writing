<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (despair vs. determination) act simultaneously in pivotal rupture scene; final choice to use chipped die is earned through years of methodical calculation with visible cost ("texture of missed opportunity flooded his senses").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change with undeniable cost: rupture forecloses purgatory path as "glimpses of the world flooded his senses." Causal lens holds perfectly—"because" of fracture point math, "therefore" staircase collapses with shattering-glass sound.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Infinite staircase constrains every choice (endless ascent dictates movement) and charges final image ("footsteps on an endless staircase finally conquered"). Chipped die as recurring object alters tactics—imperfection enables rupture where perfection failed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias’s agency: mathematical proof completion narrows options to one decisive action. Cost is visceral—"texture of missed opportunity flooded his senses"—as purgatory’s emotional price reconfigures his stance at the bar.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "perpetual motion" evolves from prison mechanism to ruptured cycle, with final dice roll offering resonant answer to "capturing texture of possibility" without moralizing. No thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("variables and constants," "fracture point") modulates under pressure; rupture sequence compresses diction ("Now," he whispered) while maintaining mathematician’s rhythmic precision. Zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in climax ("sound like shattering glass... reality tore"). Final line’s reprise ("echoing like footsteps... finally conquered") charges closure without figurative muddle. Opening/closing symmetry flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "perpetual motion" as purgatory framework transforms mathematical rigor into emotional escape. Risk-taking (math as rupture mechanism) heightens stakes without gimmickry; chipped die’s imperfection feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
