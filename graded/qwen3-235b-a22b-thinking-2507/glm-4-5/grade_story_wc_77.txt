<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "skin crawl while drawing me deeper" and micro-choices like touching the clasp despite terror. Future-self reveal lacks sufficient groundwork, slightly undercutting causality for the pivotal transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: "curse is your blessing" paradox reweights death with undeniable cost in the crumbling funhouse. Accumulative lens holds via luminance density, though advisor's origin edges toward mystical convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Funhouse actively constrains choices (curtains, mirrors) and charges closure: its repulsive allure dissolves as protagonist understands transformation. Opera cloak clasp evolves from object to light-source, directly shaping the final image's charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency—reading paradoxes forces fear's reconfiguration. Cost is visceral in the dissolving funhouse and clasp, though the advisor's guidance slightly blurs self-determination at peak escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "repulsive allure that is transformation itself" reweights prior horror without moralizing. Final image resonates as a non-literal answer to "fear's weakness," avoiding all thematic echo pitfalls.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "lingering luminance made my skin crawl while drawing me deeper" shows embodied contradiction. Rhythmic control tightens during clasp unsnapping, with patterned elision (resuscitation backstory) taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "luminance coalesced into final paradox" does triple duty. Final line's "repulsive allure" recharges opening phrase flawlessly, avoiding all figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms death-confrontation trope through photographic curse specificity. Emotional truth in "fear clings to illusion something is lost in dying" avoids cliché, though carnival setting risks familiarity without the clasp's unique mechanics.</comment>
