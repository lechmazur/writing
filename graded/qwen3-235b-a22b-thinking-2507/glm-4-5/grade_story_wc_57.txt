<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "infinitely patient" trait is labeled without embodied struggle during the silent hours. Fulgurite glass reveals motivation but the pivotal rope acceptance lacks visible internal tradeoffs beyond gratitude.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with rope gift reconfiguring options, but cost remains abstract ("infinitely grateful" lacks felt consequence). Accumulative/Textural lens holds through knot-decoding, though the fog's role in pressure escalation feels atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Golden dock snow and fulgurite glass constrain choices—snow mutes sound enabling the fisherman's trust, glass serves as tangible proof. Final fog-parting path charges closure through micro-setting evolution from obstruction to revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through knot-decoding pressure, but the cost of preserving methods remains conceptual rather than viscerally paid. Fisherman's softening shifts options credibly, yet the collector's final step lacks tangible forfeiture beyond implied future labor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through knots-as-language, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "lightning captured in sand" as temporal preservation, but the "secret weavers" concept leans slightly allegorical without sufficient grounding in concrete stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>Perceptual signature shines in tactile rope/fog details, with voice modulating from observational to awed. Fisherman's driftwood-rough dialogue distinctively contrasts the collector's internal cadence, though "oceanic hush" repeats verge on mannerism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong rhythm and specificity ("fulgurite glass," "driftwood-rough voice") elevate prose, but filter verbs ("he noticed," "he felt") cluster in the decoding sequence, dulling immediacy during pivotal tension. Final line's "illuminated path" avoids overwriting through earned resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of knot linguistics with ecological preservation avoids trope pitfalls. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off through Charged Poise closure, though the "secret weavers" framing edges toward familiar mysticism without deeper cultural specificity.</comment>
