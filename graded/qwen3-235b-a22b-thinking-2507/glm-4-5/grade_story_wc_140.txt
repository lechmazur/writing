<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Embodied contradiction shines in "ghost with flesh that hungers for identity," avoiding therapy-speak. Micro-choices like pocketing the poison label reveal hierarchy of values, but sparse on-page pressure limits escalation of internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully in "I press on through the labyrinth," crystallizing refusal with felt cost of perpetual limbo. Orientation anchors by line 3; Accumulative lens holds through tidal rhythm, though escalation lacks one decisive intensification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Shipping containers function as micro-setting when the poison label's fading charges the final image, constraining identity reconstruction. "Histories written in water" elevates specificity, but generic "port city" references slightly dilute environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bureaucratic erasure) is signaled early and deepens through accumulated stories, but tension remains static without narrowing options. The tidal rhythm tightens time pressure, yet cost stays conceptual rather than viscerally paid on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "palimpsest" and "histories written in water," avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights erasure as "purpose not in what was lost but in what remains," offering resonant non-literal answer to identity's fragility without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "viewing the world as a palimpsest" shows character-specific cognition. Rhythmic control mirrors tidal flow, but "fragility of documentation" risks abstract diction in one high-pressure beat, slightly disrupting voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with "sweet then gone without trace," yet adjacent paraphrase in "tides dictate my existence... rhythm of tides" creates minor scaffold. No closure artifacts, but two template cadence runs in mid-section dull immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms bureaucratic erasure through port-specific metaphor ("containers themselves" as testament to erasure), avoiding templates. Risky lyric structure pays off with "texture of memories that make me real," though generality in "collective memory" slightly dilutes freshness.</comment>
