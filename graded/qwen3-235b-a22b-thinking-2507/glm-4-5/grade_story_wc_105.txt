<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cancer diagnosis inserted as thematic device without embodied micro-choices; "cells divided" lacks specific sensory cost. Interior contradiction strong but mortality feels grafted onto core motivation rather than integrated through prior action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with undeniable cost in the sound's transformation. Cancer reveal disrupts accumulative lens coherence mid-escalation; "recent reminder" lacks causal linkage to present choices despite strong final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Environment constrains choice: water amplifies color-sounds enabling the capture method. Final image charged by forge residue becoming "snow on battlefield" reweighted as resilience. Micro-setting (jellyfish colonies) directly shapes the climax's harmonic resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>Textural escalation masterful in sound-capture sequence but cancer timeframe fails to tighten decisions. "Cells divide" motif remains abstract backdrop rather than altering tactics; dominant stake (trust sound) lacks integration with mortality pressure despite parallel phrasing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: frozen glass shattering becomes healing resonance. Avoids moralizing; final image ("trust reforming stronger") reweights destruction without sentimentality. Cancer's thematic potential underdeveloped in closure despite strong core concept integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("reds into bass notes") modulates perfectly with pressure. Register drift in "cells divided in his skin" breaks POV lexicon – clinical phrasing jars against artistic focalizer. No head-hopping; rhythmic control exceptional during sound transformation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in climax but "cells divided" creates synonym churn with cancer diagnosis. Minor density issue: "battered marvel" refrain risks template cadence though payoff justifies repetition. Final image crystalline with no figurative muddle despite high lyricism.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: synesthesia + shipwreck ecology + hearing aid physics creates inevitable emotional arc. Transformation test passed – swap details and the core truth (destruction births resilience) still resonates through specific constraints. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
