<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Label-only "strangely trustworthy" trait lacks contradictory impulses or embodied cost; Aris's flawless compliance undercuts interior struggle despite clear altruistic motivation for Elion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lens ambiguity (Causal vs. Accumulative) persists past midpoint; closure (Charged Poise solstice message) lacks legible cost—no sacrifice or irreversible change anchors the nebula's "brambled hope."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Floating arches and watering bell create vivid texture but fail micro-setting test—neither constrains choices (e.g., bell's discovery feels coincidental) nor charges the final image beyond symbolic repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (soil crisis) signals early but escalation lacks agency-driven tightening; Aris's passive obedience to messages avoids meaningful trade-offs, leaving "brambled hope" abstract rather than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Thematic echo dominates final paragraph ("strangers became family stronger than blood"), replacing earned resonance with moralizing; cooperation theme emerges from plot but isn't deepened by specific character cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Ghost POV creates passive observational distance; filter verbs ("Elion knew," "Elion watched") dilute immediacy during high-pressure beats, though "nebula of respite" shows distinct atmospheric voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Strangely trustworthy" functions as therapy-speak label in peak beat (-0.4); otherwise lyrical prose avoids loops, but "brambled hope" metaphor risks abstraction without sufficient concrete grounding in action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Butterfly bell offers fresh inflection, yet altruistic ghost trope remains derivative; emotional specificity in community rebirth is undercut by generic "family stronger than blood" resolution lacking moral complexity.</comment>
