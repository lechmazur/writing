<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is abstract ("hovering between man he was/wanted to be") without embodied micro-choices under pressure; "before they find the bodies" motivation lacks causal link to actions, reducing stakes to thematic echo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Closure (finding voice to whisper truth) lands as Charged Poise under Accumulative lens, but cost remains conceptual—no visible price paid for "threading the labyrinth" despite "bodies" urgency, failing cost proof test at ending beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lighthouse reef actively constrains choice (jagged reef as metaphor for lies claiming trust) and charges final image ("rewriting ending" against stone walls); copperlight repose evolves from dawn to evening to mirror internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes ("before they find bodies") signaled early but never concretely tested—pressure accumulates texturally through recurring images without narrowing options or altering tactics; tightening lacks visible price that reshapes protagonist's actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (lattice bearing "marks of those who came before" now overwritten with truth), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights legacy without stating a moral, though "sustains impossibilities" leans toward abstract resilience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("copperlight repose," "scuffs on narrow door") filters all description through character-specific bias; rhythmic control deepens under pressure with purposeful repetition of "hovering" and "sustains impossibilities" as psychic-state markers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Three "hovering" repetitions in adjacent paragraphs create template cadence; "sustains impossibilities" phrasing drifts into abstract diction during high-pressure beats, diluting momentum despite otherwise vivid textural specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fable legacy with lighthouse prison setting feels inevitable, but safety-hedged execution avoids bold risks—emotional stakes remain conceptual ("hope of redemption") rather than visceral, lacking one transformative intensification.</comment>
