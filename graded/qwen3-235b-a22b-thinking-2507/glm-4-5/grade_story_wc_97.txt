<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "steely longing" manifests through music choices and clock handling; micro-choices like threading film under pressure show hierarchy of values. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (time's relativity made visceral via glowing clock); Accumulative lens holds through density increase in final descent. Horizon's deepening violet perfectly reweights temporal stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Tidal arbor's dipping branches constrain choices by tightening timeline; broken clock functions as micro-setting charging final image. Film archive's temperature control slightly ornamental though.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via compass failures → arbor descent → shutdown deadline; agency-driven deepening as pianist modifies projector. Felt cost crystallizes when clock spins, reconfiguring time's meaning without physical resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image of composing in liminal space offers non-literal answer to "broken things made whole"; avoids moralizing while reweighting grief through film reel mechanics. No thematic echo despite poetic density.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in musician's temporal awareness ("melodies flowing like dreams"); rhythmic control accelerates during descent. "Steely longing" refrain modulates tension without becoming tic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "flickering compasses" recurrence serves pressure not scaffold. Final paragraph's cadence shift ("disappeared—not into... but through") achieves propulsion without muddle. Minor register drift in "strategically creative".</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Film reel as time vessel transforms grief trope through pianist's artistic lens; tidal arbor logic fully commits to premise. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring Charged Poise closure.</comment>
