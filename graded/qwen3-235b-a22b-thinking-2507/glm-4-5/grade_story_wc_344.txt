<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (urgency vs reverence) drive the pivotal repair choice; embodied cost in "fingers trembling" and identity shift to "belonging" earns closure. Slight over-reliance on poetic abstraction ("motivation burned stronger than the cold") prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: mirrors transform to show ancestors with conceptual cost in Elias's identity shift ("driftwood nostalgia now giving way to belonging"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density, though escalation lacks one tightening beat before climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clockmaker's gear assortment charges the final image with "scattering rainbow reflections," but the frozen library remains atmospheric rather than constraining choices. Strong sensory specificity ("breath forming ephemeral clouds") lacks one pressure point where environment directly alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoration as belonging) deepens through Elias's agency, with legible cost in identity transformation. However, conflict lacks tangible opposition—the library's challenges feel passive, missing one live option foreclosed before the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: the clockwork heart's pulse melts ice, making "knowledge flowing like water" the resonant answer to restoration. Zero thematic echo; final image reweights "driftwood" from loss to belonging without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in gear/light observations, with rhythmic control during repair ("He closed his eyes..."). Minor register drift in "rhythm of repair" and slight overwriting ("hauntingly bright" repetitions) prevent higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loop ("through scraps of prophecy" verbatim repeat) and "hauntingly bright" synonym churn in final third incur -1.5 Non-closure Accumulation Cap. Otherwise strong propulsion, but artifacts disallow 9+ per rules.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "lunar-eclipse locksmith" as knowledge restorer elevates tropes, and "driftwood nostalgia" transforms meaningfully. Derivative "frozen library" setting prevents 8.8+ despite bold Accumulative structure paying off in closure.</comment>
