<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in embodied burden ("burden this 'gift' had been") with contradictory impulses (dread/hope). Micro-choices during retrace reveal value hierarchy but epiphany lacks sufficient struggle at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost (accepting complexity), but the precise cost moment ("gripped the tablet") lacks visceral legibility under Causal lens. Lens holds consistently from eclipse setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Glowing viaduct constrains every choice (rain/eclipse dependency) and charges final image ("glow softened"). Sensory specificity ("damp golden stones humming") embodies urgency without static cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding self) tightens via eclipse timeframe, but escalation leans observational; Elias witnesses rather than actively struggles against timeline pressure during pivotal convergence scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete confrontation with alternate selves, avoiding moralizing. Final line reweights "fractured timelines" as positive metaphor, though "conquering labyrinth" phrasing edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("world simultaneously seemed brighter") with rhythmic control during tension. Minor deduction for "burden this 'gift' had been" slightly generic phrasing under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative language ("fracture like shattering glass"), but paraphrase loop in emotional description ("darkening brightness matched emotional state"/"paradoxical sensation") dulls climax momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "chosen one" trope through specific mechanics (procedural timeline generation). Risk-taking in internal resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry; "beautifully complex" crystallizes authentic emotional truth.</comment>
