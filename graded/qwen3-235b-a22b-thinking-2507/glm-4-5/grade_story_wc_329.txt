<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elayn's motivation burns bright with embodied contradiction—her violin case "clutched tightly" while heart rhythms calm statues—but internal conflict lacks depth; no tangible struggle between safety and purpose during the orchard incursion weakens earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: the final image of "people began to look up, to listen, and finally, to dream again" crystallizes reawakened wonder with felt cost (locust shell's dust), though the effortless transformation slightly dilutes stakes escalation under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orchard's "tarnished wonder" and metallic divide anchor specificity, but the locust shell (as micro-setting) doesn't constrain choices—it guides steps without tactical cost, narrowly missing Q3's 9+ gate despite vivid copper-sky imagery charging the final sapling growth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via textural deepening (statues' stirring, orchard's hum), yet pressure lacks meaningful trade-offs; the sapling uprooting faces no genuine resistance beyond fleeting statue movement, muting the cost of beauty's reawakening under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "crystalline vines climbing the sky-bridge," reweighting mechanical suppression with resonant specificity, but avoids complexity—no counter-argument to regulated beauty weakens moral calculus despite strong "tarnished wonder" motif evolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "sky the color of aged copper," with rhythm modulating from "resonantly soft" notes to bounding escape music; minor register drift in "conceptual cost" exposition slightly disrupts voice coherence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose flows with textural precision ("gears bloomed into intricate patterns"), but "resonantly soft" repetition (3x) creates synonym churn, and "profound release" leans toward abstraction, muddling the orchard's sigh—a critical closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical oppression and organic magic feels inevitable, with "tarnished wonder" avoiding cliché, though the locust shell's symbolic convenience slightly undermines risk-taking; transformation through violin-as-magic conduit earns high-band originality.</comment>
