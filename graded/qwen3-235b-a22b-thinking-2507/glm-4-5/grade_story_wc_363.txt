<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clear motivation (restore sound per grandmother) but interiority lacks contradictory impulses; memory sacrifices feel abstract rather than embodied cost. "Lilting laughter" offered without visceral weight undermines stakes escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost (memories sacrificed), but puzzle mechanics feel coincidental rather than accumulated pressure. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, yet cost proof falters—bead dimming signals loss but memory sacrifices lack on-page emotional consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid bamboo/orchard imagery anchors atmosphere, but setting never constrains choices; the puzzle path operates magically without environmental friction. Micro-setting potential of amber bead (worn necklace) isn't leveraged tactically during sacrifices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore sound) escalates via accumulating silence, yet sacrifice mechanics feel arbitrary—no visible trade-offs alter tactics beyond initial compliance. Pressure deepens through pattern (puzzle steps), but memory-forfeiture lacks tangible impact on journey choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "silence as presence" crystallized through final sound-weaving, avoiding moralizing. Final image resonates non-literally, though complexity lacks counter-readings—no exploration of whether restored sound truly redeems loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (textile metaphors: "raveling silence," "unraveling tapestry") reflects loom-spinner POV. Rhythmic control sustains lyrical density under pressure; "stoically sparkling" momentarily drifts into authorial voice but quickly recovers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong propulsion with minimal scaffold, though "time blurred strangely" tells rather than shows temporal distortion. Final line ("weave... fabric of sound itself") charges closure without overwriting, but "hush of time's unraveling tapestry" repetition slightly dulls momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence-as-texture elevates trope, though puzzle mechanics feel derivative. Bold risk in Accumulative structure pays off via cohesive sensory unraveling, but "rummage sale box" arrival lacks transformation from prior particulars.</comment>
