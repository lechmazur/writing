<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority shines in time-warped confusion ("yesterday felt as distant as a century ago"), but ghost negotiation lacks contradictory impulses in climax; regret remains abstract without concrete trade-offs during the bridge-crossing choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise (carousel restarts, "liquid peace" replacing "fractured stillness") with conceptual cost—the camera wheel's dissolution—but escalation lacks active protagonist agency; the word-bridge forms magically without Cyrus altering tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: the lagoon’s "fractured stillness" evolves into "liquid peace," while the camera wheel’s physical use (harnessing, image-formation) directly constrains Cyrus’s final choice and charges the healing resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (negotiating past self) is clear, but pressure never tightens meaningfully; Cyrus collects fragments passively, and the bridge’s formation requires no earned sacrifice or tactical shift before the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "eroded ambitions" reweighted at closure—the ghost’s "transparent form" mirroring Cyrus’s state dissolves into "unforeseeable new beginnings," avoiding moralizing while resonating with time’s flow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in time-warped diction ("moments from childhood as fresh as morning dew"), though elevated phrasing ("profoundly chronologically confused") slightly drifts from scavenger POV during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("fractured stillness" repeated near climax) and dense metaphors ("silt at the bottom of this very lagoon") slightly dull momentum, but no artifacts touch the luminous closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms scavenger trope via time-warps and story-fragments; the word-bridge synthesis feels fresh, though carousel imagery leans familiar. Emotional specificity in "negotiating with ghost" elevates beyond novelty.</comment>
