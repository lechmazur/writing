<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Clara’s hesitation to articulate building language as "inheritance," not epiphany. Flaws feel genuine (e.g., sugar-borrowing pretext), but Mr. Abernathy’s late heritage reveal lacks prior causality, slightly weakening her final acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: dawn descent with the seal crystallizes options (carry heritage’s weight) with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors early; Accumulative/Textural lens holds via symbol density crescendo. Minor lens ambiguity at heritage reveal costs 0.1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rooftop meteor shower actively illuminates symbols ("glowing faintly in meteoric light"), constraining the revelation beat. Seal’s brass carvings charge the final image, reweighting "old friends" with specificity. Study’s "cluttered books" lack equivalent tactile pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deciphering building language) tightens via the "interrogate" beat forcing Clara’s thematic articulation. Agency-driven deepening lands, but cost remains conceptual; lacks visceral felt price at closure despite strong lineage revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through Clara’s tactile observations ("warnings, blessings, histories recorded in stone"), never stated. Final line reweights opening mystery into "old friends" with earned resonance—zero moralizing, pure subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV voice distinct: Clara’s architectural focus shapes perception ("stones settled, timbers creaked"). Mr. Abernathy’s dialogue ("Of course, dear") carries subtext. Minor register drift in "conceptual cost" phrasing during meteor scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose lean but "spark of recognition" borders cliché. No fatal loops; rhythmic variation supports pressure ("ephemeral as forgotten words" → short "Now, I must interrogate you"). Final line’s specificity ("stories finally ready to be told") avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms heritage trope through architectural specificity (windowsill patterns, foundation shifts). Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off, but "mysterious familiarity" recurrence feels slightly template-driven despite organic closure charge.</comment>
