<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied emotion ("heavy cloak of regrets settle like mist") and micro-choices (paddling despite rejection). Final shift earned by father's lesson and dolphin catalyst, though the dolphin convenience slightly undermines causal inevitability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost ("compass felt lighter, transforming from failure symbol to capacity reminder"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density buildup, with rejection letter tightening options and final image reconfiguring meaning under persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Brass compass functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (physical weight, navigation method) and charges closure through transformation. Coastal setting pressures action via dolphin catalyst and utility-pole navigation system, avoiding symbolic convenience through tactile integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Self-forgiveness vs perpetual regret stake tightens meaningfully via rejection letter, driving Elena's agency in reinterpretation. Escalation manifests through textural density (compass weight intensifying then lightening) with unmistakable cost legible in the physical sensation shift during paddling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: utility poles as makeshift stars reweights navigation concept without moralizing. Final image ("student of the sea again") offers resonant non-literal answer to central question, avoiding sentimentality through earned specificity of her diminished-yet-hopeful stance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in navigation-focused noticing ("identifying distant poles") with rhythmic control under pressure. Minor abstraction ("flickering faith she'd been nurturing") slightly dilutes peak-beat immediacy, though voice modulation during dolphin moment compensates.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold with high information density; "diminished echo of the world where she once soared" exemplifies precise textural specificity. No figurative muddle in peak beats, though "merrily melancholic state" borders on overwritten abstraction without sufficient grounding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis through utility-pole navigation method transforms familiar redemption trope. Emotional specificity in "broken navigator" arc avoids generic templates, with compass symbolism gaining authenticity through tactile integration rather than thematic echo.</comment>
