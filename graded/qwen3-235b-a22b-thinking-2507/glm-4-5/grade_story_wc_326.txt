<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (seeking return vs accepting digital existence) crystallizes through ink ritual; heartbeat counting embodies connection to life with tangible cost in final coffee-making gesture. Avoids epiphanies via concrete micro-choices like shard placement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: snow stopping signals transformation cost, "failure isn't the end" crystallizes stance with felt consequence in stored ink patterns. Accumulative lens holds through ink density shifts reweighting system-failure stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Porcelain shard constrains ritual tactics (angled droplets) and charges final image (resting while coffee made); opal walls' aurora shifts mirror internal state. Micro-setting actively pressures choices beyond atmospheric decoration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through ink-pattern density shift (from "glitch and jump" to "systematic failure" revelation), but heartbeat rhythm's calming effect slightly softens pressure escalation during climax. Cost legible in stored papers where body once lay.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"Wisdom in failure" emerges solely through ink ritual and coffee gesture; final line reweights "death certificate error" as connection attempt without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by making solace active (brewing coffee) not passive acceptance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in heartbeat counting as rhythm anchor; "ephemeral patterns" diction reflects digital consciousness. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates perfectly from humming anticipation to dawn solace.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; "spilled ink forms intricate webs" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Slight overwriting in "opal observatory pulses with energy under the snow globe of night" dilutes final image’s charge by 0.1.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Digital ghost premise transformed via porcelain shard’s physicality and heartbeat counting as embodied tether. Fresh inflection: "death certificate error" as invitation to cross-world existence, avoiding afterlife clichés through ink ritual specificity.</comment>
