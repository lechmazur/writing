<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority shows concrete contradiction ("buried optimism" contained against "dangerous hope") and embodied emotion via tracing patterns while murmuring equations; minor abstraction in "mathematics of emotion" phrasing prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (hope's danger made visceral when mentor's vision appears), but cost proof lacks exact on-page sentence showing paid consequence beyond internal containment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mosaic stepping stone constrains choice (ritual requires its patterns) and charges final image (new configuration offers "path forward"); cavern orchard's bioluminescence and stalactite rhythm actively shape magical cause/effect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens: density increases as eyes "come alive" and patterns shift, reweighting "ambiguous loss" stake; cost (hope's danger) is felt but not concretely paid on page during deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through orchard metaphor ("mineral-rich drops that nourished her orchard" mirroring emotional transformation); final realization reweights premise without moralizing, offering resonant non-literal answer to "mathematics of emotion."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature evident in "chipped patterns forming constellations" and "dripping stalactites slow rhythm"; minor abstraction in "buried optimism" phrasing slightly dilutes emotional immediacy under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with "murmuring equations that described sorrow, joy, love, and hope as elements in a grand formula" doing triple duty; no figurative muddle despite lyrical intensity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of math and emotion via bioluminescent orchard logic; "mineral-rich drops nourishing feelings" transforms trope into specific causal mechanism that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
