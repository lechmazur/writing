<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Professionally grounded motivation but lacks contradictory impulses; exhaustion shows cost yet internal conflict remains surface-level. No visible struggle between preservation instinct and mission urgency despite life-draining stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands with visible cost (collapsed illustrator, shortened future) under causal lens. Minor flaw: giant's awakening escalation feels slightly convenient rather than earned through protagonist's prior choices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rooftop canals function as micro-setting that constrains choices (water patterns as map), charging the final healed-flow image. Some ornamental descriptions dilute pressure during chamber approach.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes viscerally tighten through protagonist's agency: giant's stirring clouds force accelerated time-borrowing with escalating physical cost. Final collapse makes depletion unmistakable while restoring rhythm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through water/sound motifs without moralizing; healed canals offer resonant non-literal answer to natural order. Avoids thematic echo by embedding "echoes born" concept in physical action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (flora/fauna focus) modulates under pressure; time-dilation descriptions create rhythmic control. Slight register drift in "crystalline cage" repetition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with minimal scaffold. Minor density dip in chamber description ("walls vibrated with suppressed sound") slightly dulls closure beat momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time manipulation and sound mythology; rooftop canals with giant creates memorable specificity. Bold quiet ending risks sentimentality but lands through concrete water imagery.</comment>
