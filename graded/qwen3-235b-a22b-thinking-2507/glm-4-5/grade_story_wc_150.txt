<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "hands slightly trembling" versus conviction to help, but emotional progression lacks sufficient struggle; exile weight lifts too smoothly without visible setbacks that would deepen the earned faith restoration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with cost ("weight of exile lift"), but accumulative lens suffers minor escalation drift; "purposeful wandering" method isn't dramatized as a constraint, weakening pressure coherence despite strong final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard functions as essential micro-setting—roots tightening around bones during work directly constrains choices and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate with vivid, purpose-driven specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Kaelen's agency (rebuilding fragments = "journey completed"), but "purposeful wandering" fails to manifest as active pressure; cost is visible yet escalation lacks a tangible constraint that would narrow options under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the sundial's completion—"longest path home" reweights diaspora through concrete action, avoiding moralizing; the final shadow cast crystallizes renewal without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("foreign dust clinging to boots," "words flowing like water") anchors voice, but "cautious enchantment" is stated rather than embodied through pressure-modulated rhythm during high-stakes restoration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor overwriting ("grotesque yet beautiful dance") and a paraphrase loop in "reverent way his fingers traced its ancient markings" dull closure proximity; density remains high but prevents 9+ despite strong propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of diaspora narrative with archaeological restoration feels inevitable, yet "purposeful wandering" lacks bold transformation; specificity in catacomb orchard elevates beyond trope but method integration holds back risk distinction.</comment>
