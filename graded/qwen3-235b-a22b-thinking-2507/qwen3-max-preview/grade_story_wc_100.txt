<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("stubbornness mistaken for resignation") drives action; embodied emotion in "knuckles white" and "hands didn't tremble" shows irreversible change with visceral cost at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: distress signals transform into belonging through prism placements, with cost crystallized in "hands didn’t tremble"—a physical manifestation of earned stasis after releasing souls.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Underwater library constrains every choice (embedding prisms in silt, pressure-sensitive placements); final image of silt-brushed coat charges the "chased stillness" tone with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (answering unrest) tightens through protagonist’s agency: dismantling lens narrows options to "occupying impossible spaces," with cost legible in abandoned resignation ("walked deeper, not toward surface").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "permanent address for rest" evolves from graves to light-woven belonging, avoiding moralizing via final image of unsent love letters—resonant without resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("molars ache" for resonance, "brine-stilled currents") modulates under pressure; syntax shifts from lyrical ("frozen lightning") to staccato ("He couldn’t bury it. Couldn’t ignore it.") without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffolding; "prisms fractured like frozen lightning" exemplifies concrete specificity. Minor deduction for "harmonic tremors" explanation slightly over-clarifying after sensory setup.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms ghost-story tropes: lens as communication device (not rescue beacon) and "cathedral of quiet endings" redefines rest through specific, irreplaceable underwater logic and emotional risk.</comment>
