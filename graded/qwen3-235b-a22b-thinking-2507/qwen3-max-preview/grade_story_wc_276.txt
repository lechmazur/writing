<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "let the echo flow through her—not to possess, but to pass through," showing simultaneous pursuit and release. Embodied emotion avoids labels via "teeth ache" from lullaby, but minor flaw: "cool-headed" trait lacks struggle against the garden's screaming frequencies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost: shattered spike shards become "tuning fork for the next time," crystallizing rebirth stakes. Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sonic density intensifies to rupture, reweighting the dominant stake through the fisher’s agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rail spike functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (calibrated zigzagging) and charges the final image (shards as tuning fork). Sensory hierarchy excels—"shaping absence between breaths" grounds abstract concepts—but tactile details beyond feet/soil remain sparse in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: matching feral pitch narrows options to the spike’s resonance, culminating in the deliberate slam that inverts reality. Cost is legible in the cracked spike’s "weight, the gravity of forgotten divinity," but the garden’s "settled" quiet slightly softens the felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the cracked spike’s transformation from tool to tuning fork, offering non-literal answer: echoes are "carried," not captured. Avoids moralizing by showing rebirth via constellations’ gold glow, though "maternal fury" risks abstraction without deeper character integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "maps feelings into phonemes" and rhythmic control during pressure ("humming backward through the melody"). Zero filter verbs; voice modulates perfectly from "calibrated zigzag" to the raw "Aaaaah," but "sleepwalking constellations" description borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via concrete verbs ("shuddered," "snapped," "shattered"). Final line’s "tuning fork for the next when patterns break themselves" achieves high density, though "cherry-red with absorbed resonance" slightly strains metaphor coherence in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fishing and sonic archaeology transforms tropes: rail spike’s iron "vibrating with ghost of trains" grounds abstraction in tangible history. Risk-taking (transliterating emotions) heightens stakes without gimmickry, earning the +0.3 risk distinction for closure’s resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
