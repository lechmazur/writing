<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Tracer’s "persistently curious" motivation is concrete (ignoring summons risks hauntings) and embodied in her urgency with the photograph’s pulse, but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure—her choices feel inevitable rather than contested. Micro-choices like kneeling not "too close" reveal value hierarchy, yet her flaw (unanswered echoes fester) isn’t tested through mistakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant Charged Poise: the synchronized pulse, mist thinning, and walking toward exit crystallize options with felt cost ("They’re not coming back"). Accumulative lens holds as sensory density (condensation, lilies, pulse) deepens the stake without causal turns, though no persistent constraint shapes tactics beyond the hearing aid’s function.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The hearing aid and photograph function as micro-settings that charge closure—their synchronized pulse and calm echo reconfigure the girl’s state. Atrium details (weeping glass, wet stone) vividly reflect urgency but don’t constrain choices; mist thinning as they walk out ties environment to emotional resolution, narrowly clearing the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (waiting vs. moving on) tightens through the pulse’s escalation from "stuttered, surged" to panicked flutter, narrowing options. Tracer’s counter-pulse broadcast drives the deepening, with cost legible in her kneeling endurance and the girl’s tearful realization. Hairline slip: tracer’s personal cost (emotional labor) isn’t foregrounded as sharply as the girl’s.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the photograph’s "changed frequency" and calm pulse reweight love’s persistence without moralizing. Final image (photograph tucked between them, pulse at rest) offers a resonant CR—love as resonance, not presence—avoiding abstraction. "Love doesn’t die" risks thematic echo but is saved by diegetic integration with the hearing aid.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in tactile, biased details ("boots whispering," "lilies floated like surrendered hands"), modulating rhythm under stress. Slight register drift in "vulnerable voice, fractured by grief" edges toward diagnostic phrasing, preventing 9.0 despite otherwise controlled psychic distance and voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion through lean, multi-tasking prose ("statues... glazed with dew"). Figurative language ("liquid gold puddles") serves the accumulative lens without muddle. One near-miss: "syncopated ache" risks overwriting but is anchored by the hearing aid’s mechanics, keeping peak beats clear and visceral.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "contact tracer" into emotional resonance via concrete mechanics (pulse-tracking hearing aid), avoiding trope pitfalls. Fresh inflection in "love changes frequency" as diegetic tech metaphor, though the core premise edges close to familiar grief narratives without sufficient risk-taking to breach 8.8.</comment>
