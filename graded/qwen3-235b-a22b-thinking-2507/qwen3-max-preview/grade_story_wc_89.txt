<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("not grief, nor vengeance, but something quieter, hungrier") drives agency; embodied emotion ("grief learning song") avoids labels; final renunciation of singular identity earned through surrender's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "footprints glowed briefly before fading—not into earth, but into story" crystallizes conceptual cost under Accumulative lens; orientation anchored by word 15 ("fairy-tale orchard blooming under permanent moonlight").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Spices function as micro-setting that constrains choice (crushing releases reality-bending aromas) and charges final image ("carried the scent of saffron and sorrow"); orchard actively responds to pressure ("branches leaned closer").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's agency: spice ritual narrows options to surrender ("did not resist"), with visible cost in metamorphosis ("no longer just whisperer, no longer just beast"); dominant stake signaled by paragraph 2.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image "the bond was. And it was blooming. Still. Always." offers resonant non-literal answer to death-as-dialect theme without moralizing; avoids thematic echo via embodied particulars ("cosmic shift in her bones").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("saffron that wept gold tears") and rhythmic control under pressure ("bone learning feather, blood learning flame"); no head-hopping despite dual presence; voice modulates from solitude to intimacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; every line multi-tasks (e.g., "petals fell like slow snow" establishes time/mood/stakes); final line's fractured cadence ("blooming. Still. Always.") heightens closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of phoenix trope through "reluctant metamorphosis" and fortune-cookie-as-key; emotional specificity ("grief learning song") avoids abstraction; risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
