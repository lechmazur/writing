<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene (panic vs. stillness) with micro-choice of unscrewing vial; sacrifice earned through scholarly motivation. Lacks flaw compounding before climax to reach 9.5+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with undeniable cost ("last bubbles left her lips") under Accumulative lens. Minimal escalation beats slightly reduce pressure depth despite oxygen countdown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vial constrains choice (must hold open) and charges final image as "seeds of remembrance." Temple's sensory logic shapes tactics ("gravity softened") while recharging "lonesome splendor" in closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through oxygen depletion and sensory immersion; cost (death as acceptance) unmistakable. Agency-driven stillness reconfigures survival stakes under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "become vessel" realization reweights "ephemeral" without moralizing. Final image ("time rippled") offers resonant non-literal answer to harnessing transience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("salt and sorrow and starlight") with rhythmic control under pressure; psychic distance tightens as oxygen fades. One borderline abstract phrase ("pilgrim of silence") prevents 10.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; sentences multi-task ("statues stared blindly" establishes setting/theme). "Distilled essence of drowned prayers" exemplifies precise texture. Slight abstraction in "ephemeral" is immediately grounded.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "gathered hush" as active resonance transforms temple trope. Risk-taking (death as transcendence) heightens stakes without obscurity; vial shattering as "purpose" feels inevitable.</comment>
