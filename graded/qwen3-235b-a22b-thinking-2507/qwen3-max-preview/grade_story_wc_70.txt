<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias' involuntary truth-telling drives key choices (e.g., confirming drone function), but the woman's motivation lacks contradictory impulses; her urgency-to-reverence shift feels earned through tactile drone interaction yet remains slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the humming drones crystallize the conceptual cost of the city's misperception ("they never stopped") with undeniable pressure, under a consistent Accumulative/Textural lens building through sensory accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tower's copper struts actively constrain choices (storing charge in drones) and charge the final image; "nectar dusk" evolves from description to thematic carrier as rain triggers the hum, meeting 9+ gate via environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when drones are revealed as capacitors (foreclosing "broken tech" option), with visible cost in Elias' prior silence; agency through observation works perfectly under Accumulative lens despite single escalation point.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "wonder isn't meant to be explained" earns resonance through matchbox ritual and final drone hum, reweighting "failure" as adaptation without moralizing; final image offers non-literal answer to "what hums when swarm sleeps?"</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("truth spilled like sap," "crystallized nectar") and rhythmic control shine, though Elias' internal voice slightly converges with the woman's dialogue during the climax ("They're capacitors"/"They're waiting").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion falters only in "synthetic drones grounding mid-flight like dead leaves" (borderline mixed metaphor); otherwise, zero loops, high density, and concrete verbs ("flecks of pollen," "pulsed with stored charge") elevate tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms drone-bee tropes via generational lacquer boxes and "belief collection" premise; risk-taking (quiet closure, conceptual stakes) heightens coherence, with the humming payoff feeling inevitable through prior sensory groundwork.</comment>
