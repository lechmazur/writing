<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her solitude amid "collated whispers"; micro-choices like measuring meme virality against irony reveal values under pressure without diagnostic labels. Final choice to map "recomposition" is earned through prior study of cultural fragments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing ("This wasn't chaos. It was recomposition") with conceptual cost in the ledger's growing weight, but the felt price of witnessing societal transformation remains slightly abstract. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds cleanly from the first glyph-tracing droplet.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight actively distorts city lights into "liquid runes," constraining her perception and charging the final map-pinning image. The measuring tape functions as micro-setting that evolves from tool to symbol of cultural measurement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation through density increase as fragmented street art converges into "cultural nodes," driven by her agency in multiplying paths. Cost is legible in the ledger's weight but could be more viscerally embodied beyond conceptual accumulation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: broken QR-code phoenixes and chalk equations solving for communal meals reweight "human grammar" without moralizing. Final visitor line "remembering forward" crystallizes the central question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct in noticing "emotional temperature" of street art; rhythm modulates from lyrical ("droplets traced slow glyphs") to clipped urgency during pattern recognition. Zero POV slippage despite reflective journaling.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops, though the "in shared hashtags, in replicated brushstrokes, in the echo" triplet risks slight cadence repetition. Figurative language ("tape coiled like dormant serpent") maintains physical logic under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms cartomancy into cultural anthropology via onyx-ink fragments; measuring despair/reinvention synthesizes post-collapse specificity with universal resonance. Risk-taking (lyric mosaic structure) heightens stakes without obscuring the closure's conceptual charge.</comment>
