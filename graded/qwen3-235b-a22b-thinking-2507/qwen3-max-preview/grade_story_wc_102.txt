<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("not nostalgia, nor penance") and embodied motivation ("gnawing question: where is unused love stored?") culminate in earned endurance kneeling before the pilgrim, with cost legible in the transformed viaduct's bloom.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: "unused love was not stored; it was sung" reconfigures the central question under Accumulative/Textural lens, crystallized by the viaduct blooming brighter as the felt consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Twilight viaduct actively constrains choices (breath adjustments at forks) and charges the final image—the blooming viaduct embodies the thematic shift, transforming from "pulsed as if breathing" to radiant closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: breath-altering navigation narrows options at path forks, culminating in the tear's splitting with conceptual cost ("reservoir... a state folded between heartbeats") legible in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the tear unfurling into "filaments of silver mist" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to "where unused love is stored," avoiding moralizing by embedding insight in sensory transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("inverted blossoms swam across parchment like drowned stars") and rhythmic control under pressure (breath-counting cadence) sustain voice without elision issues, modulating from "twilight" to luminous closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion ("slung its wooden case... like a lute of revelation" advances both action and metaphor) and no figurative muddle in peak beats like the tear's splitting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spiritual quest via concrete mechanics (breath as navigation tool, love "sung" not stored) transforms tropes; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
