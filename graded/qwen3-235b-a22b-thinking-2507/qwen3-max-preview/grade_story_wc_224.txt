<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "memory sharpened, slicing through her like obsidian wind" and micro-choices like guiding the feather downward. Embodied emotion avoids labels; cost is legible in her shift from translator to belonging. Minor deduction: visible cost beyond emotional shift isn't dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: shelves rearrange into an archway as she arrives at home, with cost legible in "thunder growled... acknowledging the shift." Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density peaks as feather dissolves, reweighting stakes via tactile luminescence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The feather's texture constrains choice (guiding fingers downward) and charges the final image ("feather landing where it was always meant to fall"). Mountain-bookstore pressures action—shelves shift to form the archway. Avoids white-room syndrome through "dew-slicked tile" and "stormcloud leather" specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (belonging vs. memory pain) tightens when the feather dissolves, forcing the stone to crack open. Agency is clear: she chooses to seed truth via texture, paying the cost of ending her translator role ("no longer translating the world"). Escalation via sensory density reweights options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of home as "frequency" emerges through concrete particulars—the rocking chair shadow, rain on cedar shingles—not moralizing. Final image ("feather landing where it was always meant to fall") resonates without stating a moral, reweighting "remembering became painful" into welcomed rain.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("mercury in her veins," "tactile luminescence") modulates under pressure: short sentences during feather dissolution ("She let it guide... rippled like quicksilver"). No head-hopping; controlled first-person limited. Slight overwriting in "dew-slicked tile" opening prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via "vanes trembling as if caught in an unfelt breeze." Figurative language ("obsidian wind," "silt of forgotten selves") risks muddle in proximity but pays off in closure. Final line avoids cliché through earned context ("like rain on thirsty soil").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis: "texture of a feather" transforms trope of magical objects into tactile method for seeding truth. Emotional specificity ("home as frequency") avoids generic templates. Risk-taking (textural escalation over causal turns) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, meeting 9+ quick test.</comment>
