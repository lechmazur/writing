<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elira’s motivation for intergenerational support is clear and embodied in her midnight walks, but internal conflict lacks depth; her steadfastness avoids contradictory impulses under pressure that would elevate to 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise—bell’s single ring crystallizing community resolve—lands with undeniable conceptual cost (endurance under sanctions), and accumulative/textural lens holds cohesively from the arbor’s first description.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (soup gathering, knowledge exchange); the bell’s recurring presence charges the final image with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sanctions deepen as a live clock, narrowing options (heavier baskets, fuel rationing), but escalation relies on external pressure rather than protagonist agency deepening the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the bell’s evolution—silent relic to shared symbol—without moralizing; the final baskets with coins offer resonant, non-literal answer to anonymity’s purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bruised twilight," "quiet currency of care") and rhythmic control under pressure; single-POV consistency avoids head-hopping while modulating tone from silence to the bell’s vow-like ring.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("milk and honeycomb tucked beside shoes" shows care without telling); no figurative muddle even in peak beats like the frozen midnight note discovery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids protest clichés through quiet resilience; the bell’s transformation from silent relic to communal symbol feels inevitable yet fresh, though risk-taking stops short of bold structural innovation.</comment>
