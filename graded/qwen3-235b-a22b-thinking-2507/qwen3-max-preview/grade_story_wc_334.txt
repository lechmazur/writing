<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "refusal to forget" versus feeding the orchard; embodied emotion in "warmth before names" avoids label-speak. Final choice to stay earns closure through prior causality, but brother/mother specifics lack friction in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from midpoint; Charged Poise closure crystallizes cost in "let the orchard take the rest" with felt conceptual price. Orientation clear by line 3, but stellar distortion setup slightly rushed before trawler incident.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse actively constrains choices—warped glass enables constellation mapping, coral-encrusted panes refract light into research tool. Final soil-brushing gesture charges closure by tethering character to setting’s physicality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist’s agency: placing mushroom under skylight triggers climax. Cost unmistakable in "let the orchard take the rest," narrowing options to stark sacrifice. One tightening suffices, perfectly calibrated to length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "emotional rupture" as sustenance, curiosity as fatal habit. Final line reweights premise without moralizing—"oldest habit" crystallizes non-literal answer to memory’s cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in "brine and memory," "fractured rainbows across oilskin." Rhythmic control peaks during memory seepage ("warmth before names"), with zero head-hopping. Voice modulates flawlessly from clinical to visceral.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "sticky-sweet juice of sun-warmed peaches" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Figurative language sparse but potent ("cathedral of lost seasons"), never muddling peak beats. Closure image razor-sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms fairy ring trope into memory parasite with emotional specificity. Risk-taking (underwater greenhouse) heightens stakes coherently; "studying broken constellations" synthesizes science/folklore inevitably in hindsight.</comment>
