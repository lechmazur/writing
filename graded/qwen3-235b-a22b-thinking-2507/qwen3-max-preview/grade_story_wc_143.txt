<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids labels ("throat tight" vs "sad"); micro-choices like cryo-film camera mods reveal hierarchy of values. Slight dip at "bitterly behind visor" edges toward summary, but communion shift from documentation feels earned through vacuum mechanics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: taped note "Beauty intact" crystallizes the inspector’s endurance with conceptual cost ("message unreceived"). Orientation flawless in opening line; lens (Accumulative) holds through thermal-spike trigger and whisper to summit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lunar regolith and vacuum pressure actively constrain the hourglass mechanics (0.00001 psi threshold), while the micro-labeler charges closure. "Thermal spike" fracture isn’t backdrop—it’s the engine of the climax, making environment indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (bearing witness) tightens via the 04:57 countdown and vacuum mechanics, narrowing options to endurance. Cost legible in "throat tight" when realizing message is undecodable. Agency is quiet but potent—her outlasting forecloses leaving early.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "message unreceived. Beauty intact"—a resonant, non-literal answer to obsolescence. Avoids moralizing; final image ("sky too bright to weep") reweights the hourglass’s purpose without stating a moral. Pure earned subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "boots crunching softly over regolith" filters lunar physics through her vocation. Voice modulates with tension—shorter sentences at 04:57—while "dawnlit melancholy" evolves from visual to existential. Zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "weight of centuries condensed" packs density without muddle. Minor deduction: "harmonic resonance tuned to Earth’s ionosphere" risks technicality, but justified by her expertise. Closure lines ("streaks of amber against black") radiate propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms time-capsule trope via vacuum chemistry ("chemical sigh meant to be unheard"). Emotional truth in engineers building for an empty auditorium avoids sentimentality. Freshness in "outlasted the silence," though premise lacks that final hairline inevitability for 9+.</comment>
