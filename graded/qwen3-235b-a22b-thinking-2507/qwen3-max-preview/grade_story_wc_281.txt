<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: skeptic chasing ghosts via tremors. Final choice to open studio earned through somatic micro-choices ("follow the tremor"), with visible cost in emotional fragility ("tears traced warm paths"). No diagnostic label-speak under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "true communion wasn’t chemical... etched in tremors and light" reconfigures stakes with felt cost (emotional exhaustion, fragile hope). Accumulative lens holds, but orientation debt at 150 words slightly delays spatial anchors despite functional disorientation payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Studio isn’t backdrop—it pressures choices (oscilloscope patched via somatic cues). Geode sliver as micro-setting constrains every action, charging final image where it "conducts the signal." Sensory hierarchy perfectly mirrors urgency: crisis narrows to "ozone and turpentine" amid fractal projections.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (are voices real?) tightens through somatic escalation, narrowing options to embodied navigation. Cost is visceral (diaphragm tightening, temple pulse), but conceptual price ("fractured minds") needs sharper on-page articulation in closure beat to reach 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "feeling their shape" crystallized when geode "pulsed in rhythm with her heartbeat." Final light-painting offers non-literal answer—no moralizing—but "willowglass hope" phrasing risks thematic echo without sufficient earned weight in prior beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is singular: scientific-poetic lexicon ("neural misalignment," "somatic glyphs") modulates under stress. Rhythmic control shifts from lyrical ("frozen lightning") to staccato during tremors. Zero head-hopping; focalization stays embodied even in memory flashes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: "Each tremor... was a compass needle pointing toward coherence" does triple duty. Minor overwriting in "willowglass hope—that fragile, luminous belief" slightly muddles closure’s conceptual cost, but final image remains crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms telepathy tropes via somatic lens—no mind-reading but "feeling shape" through geode pulses. Emotional truth in fractured connection avoids abstraction; "fractally precise" motif charges closure without gimmickry. Risk-taking heightens stakes while maintaining clarity.</comment>
