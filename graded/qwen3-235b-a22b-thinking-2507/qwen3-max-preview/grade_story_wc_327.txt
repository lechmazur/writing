<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices: "wept, but did not stop speaking" reveals tension between grief and duty. Motivation ("translate texture into sound") is dramatized via diamond manipulation, avoiding therapy-speak. Cost is visceral in copper veins conducting sound to prevent vanishing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost: echoes "peeled from the walls like old parchment" to join her voice, while "canyon exhaled" new responses. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds as flock patterns reweight meaning through sensory density shifts ("velvet hush of regret"). Orientation clear by line 5.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The flawed diamond constrains every choice—feeding it selectively to "let pure signal slip through"—and charges the final image as it cools "sated." Canyon’s echo-memory directly alters tactics (using flock patterns to filter resonance), fulfilling the 9+ gate through causal pressure on translation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: diamond’s hunger forces selective resonance-feeding, narrowing options to "let it gorge on noise." Cost is legible as veins "conducting sound... so it would not vanish again." Pressure grows via flock’s evolving patterns (spirals → braids → glyphs), but escalation lacks one palpable mid-beat sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final echoes ("child’s question," "lullaby hummed by a grandmother") offer non-literal answer to language death—resonant responses replacing stated moral. Theme emerges through texture ("grain of grief in a vowel"), avoiding abstraction. No thematic echo; "warrior’s oath softened into vow of peace" deepens complexity without false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in synesthetic diction: "brittle snap of resolve," "velvet hush of regret." Rhythmic control under pressure via fragmented cadence ("It did not burn her. It did not whisper. It waited.") reinforces her precision. Zero head-hopping; lyric compression taught by line 3 ("placed like stepping stone across silence").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; each line multiplies density ("towers of bone rose like shattered cathedrals into a sky that refused to echo back color"). Near-slip: "velvet hush of regret" risks decorative phrasing but earns weight through closure’s "lullaby hummed by grandmother." Final image’s "echoed her final word... forward" delivers propulsion without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms language-death trope through specific mechanics: translating "texture into sound" via diamond’s resonance-hunger and flock syntax. Fresh inflection in echoes responding with "child’s question from two centuries past"—earned by canyon’s layered time. Avoids abstraction; "consonants dissolved like salt in rain" roots loss in tactile detail.</comment>
