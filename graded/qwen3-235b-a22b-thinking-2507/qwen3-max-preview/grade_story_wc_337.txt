<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown through hesitation at the blackened knot and "reverence deepening into ritual," but minimal visible struggle beyond technical focus; "balance" motivation lacks layered tension between duty and exhaustion despite "joints stiff" detail.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: sanctuary light "warmer, clearer" after final knot, with felt cost in "weight lifting from the air" and "sanctuary exhaled." Accumulative lens holds through knot-unraveling pattern, though the screaming knot’s violent unraveling slightly overpowers subtler escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary constrains every choice—light pools at ankles during work, pulses during climax, and recharges the final image. Net’s physicality ("hemp and history") and needle’s "humming" directly charge closure; sensory details reflect urgency without checklist overuse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the blackened knot’s "scream," narrowing options to life-or-death moral choice ("I cut the line"). Cost is visceral: "weight lifting from the air" and the fisherman’s hollow eyes fading inward. Single tightening suffices for Accumulative lens, but secondary stake (self-preservation vs. duty) lacks deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "silence properly tended" reprise in final line, charging the opening "frayed edge." Avoids moralizing by making "healing" concrete via grounded spirits, though "forgiving stars" risks slight sentimentality at 799 words.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "silence... crystallized, fractured into spectral hues" reflects restorer’s specialized vision. Rhythmic control peaks in unraveling sequences ("surgical grace," "quiet detonation"), with no head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early via "interlaced hush" pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "roared, a gale of withheld truth" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" equivalent ("ledger of loss") barely touches climax, but "salt-cracked lips" borders on cliché, preventing 9.5+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms spirit-worker trope via prism physics and net-knot mechanics. Risk distinction (+0.3) for Accumulative lens execution: "relief, soft as tide retreating" reconfigures silence’s meaning organically. Near-echo of "drowned lullaby" avoids derivative pitfalls through precise integration.</comment>
