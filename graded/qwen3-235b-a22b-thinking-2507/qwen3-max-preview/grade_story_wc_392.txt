<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices (measuring echoes amid whispers), but "vulnerability is fortified" slips into abstract summary lacking concrete tradeoffs during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost (eternalized names, synced heartbeat), though a minor BRR overreach in reflection density slightly blurs present-frame urgency near midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tunnel functions as masterful micro-setting—dripping runoff and diesel residue constrain choices (measuring echo decay), but "wet wool" scent strains modern subway plausibility without sufficient causal payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through deepening: electrocution reconfigured as "rupture in memory-field" narrows options to documentation despite dismissal, with visceral cost in ancestral dread absorption and etched names.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Final image (lantern heartbeat syncing) offers resonant non-literal answer to "progress requires amnesia?" without moralizing; thematic weight emerges purely from concrete particulars like dried clay footprints.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("concrete bones," "shadows stretch like reaching fingers") modulates perfectly under stress, though "vulnerability fortified" momentarily drifts into abstract diction during climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero closure artifacts with exceptional density ("runoff drips like whispered confessions"), but template cadence in "She doesn't flinch. She answers..." creates minor propulsion drag in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms supernatural tropes through hyper-specific historical grounding (1852 escape dates, Tunnel 7 resonance); risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
