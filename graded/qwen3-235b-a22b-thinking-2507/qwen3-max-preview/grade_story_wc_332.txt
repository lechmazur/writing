<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction underdeveloped; no moment where she questions if reclaiming the dream might harm its essence. Final endurance (Earned Stasis) is earned by her methodical light-harvesting, but the "grown child = dream" reveal lacks prior friction about the dream's autonomy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with palpable cost: the palette closure signifies surrender of the chase. Accumulative lens holds—light-capturing density builds toward the reunion. Orientation anchors by line 3 ("whispering archipelago," "last ferry left").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Archipelago constrains choices (tides dictate shifts, fog hides the dream). The palette charges closure: "closed the palette, not to store, but to savor" reweights her lifelong pursuit. Sensory details ("salt-damp sand," "humming seashells") reflect her urgency without checklist fatigue.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stake (reclaiming the dream) tightens via her agency: mixing the light hues narrows options to one final attempt. Cost is legible in "indigo of surrender"—she stops searching. Escalation is accumulative (density of light-harvesting) with no coincidences; the dream's traces deepen pressure organically.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing; "Longing is the only map that never lies" is earned through action, not abstraction. Final image (reclaimed absence) offers non-literal answer to longing's tangibility. Slight thematic echo in the quoted line, but its in-character delivery avoids sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("dawn’s first blush," "tide-locked caves"), with rhythm modulating under pressure (shorter phrases during light-capture). No head-hopping; consistent first-person limited. Final "luminous absence" risks abstraction but is redeemed by tactile closure (palette closing).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffolding; "vitalize slumbering memories, coaxing them into motion" has minor synonym churn. Propulsion never stalls: "She tilted the palette. The light poured in" uses crisp syntax. No figurative muddle—light metaphors stay physically grounded ("coral of childhood birthday candles").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms tropes: light as tangible memory, dreams as physical artifacts. Emotional truth in "indigo of surrender" avoids novelty for its own sake. The reunion twist feels inevitable through her methodical chromatic quest, resisting safety-middle choices.</comment>
