<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's interiority shines through embodied choices (whispering stories, trembling label) and contradictory impulses (duty vs empathy), but his transformation lacks visceral friction in pivotal moments; the mandate's moral weight feels slightly under-tested before the gazebo climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: officials' arrival crystallizes stakes with visible cost ("frowning," risked career), while Elias's "humanity remembers" crystallizes the accumulative lens. Orientation anchors immediately ("vigilant levee warden," "midnight ridgeway").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumphs: the sapphire label and photographs constrain choices (cataloging vs dismantling) and charge the final shrine. Ridgeway functions as observational perch but lacks tactical pressure; environs don't actively shape moves beyond mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (erase vs honor memory) tightens through Elias's agency: photograph trail deepens knowledge, locals' arrival forces stance crystallization. Cost is unmistakable—career risk for communal truth—but escalation lacks one tangible mid-beat tradeoff (e.g., discarding an order).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: "Azure Reverie" label and shrine reconfigure "expunge" into "shared meaning." Final image ("wind chime hasn’t sounded... no one misses it") resonates without moralizing, avoiding the fatal "Thematic Echo" trap in the supervisor's dialogue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("rooftops breached like knuckles of a drowning man") and rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift in "sapphire-hued liqueur label" (overly precise for warden's lexicon) slightly dilutes voice consistency during high-stakes cataloging.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("boots planted on cracked asphalt that remembered a different map"), but paraphrase loops ("to document, to expunge"; "not to preserve, but to dismantle") and "whispered aloud" redundancy dent momentum in early beats without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "expunge" mandate transforms drowned-town trope into moral calculus about memory. Risks quiet closure but earns it through tactile relics. Lacks one bold structural risk (e.g., deeper Hollowmere resident POV) to hit 9.0+.</comment>
