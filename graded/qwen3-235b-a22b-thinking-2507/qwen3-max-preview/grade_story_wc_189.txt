<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her dual pursuit of cosmic insight and human connection; embodied emotions ("chill climb her wrist") avoid therapy-speak. Slight vagueness in companion's motivation limits secondary pressure depth, but micro-choices (not turning, offering presence) credibly reconfigure stakes through renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "stood beneath the stars... within the pause" crystallizes time's texture with felt cost ("breath caught between sorrow and surrender"). Orientation anchored instantly; textural escalation builds density to threshold images without causality breaks. Minor transition seam at "shadow shifted" barely grazes closure integrity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tidal pool constrains her method ("grazing periphery") and charges closure as micro-setting; cicada's return as "compass" proves essential. Sensory specificity ("wind hummed a minor chord in molars") avoids white-room syndrome. Near-cliché "cosmos wheeled" slightly dilutes 9+ eligibility despite otherwise flawless integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes viscerally tighten when companion arrives, testing her philosophy against human conflict. Agency as attention/renunciation ("no decision tonight") forecloses forced resolution with emotional cost. Secondary stake (migration argument) lacks full development, but textural escalation makes "hush before footsteps" resonate as dominant pressure point.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through granular particulars (barnacles, paper boat) not moralizing; final line "The tide turned" reweights time as cyclical threshold without stated moral. Avoids thematic echo despite "sacred" descriptor—cost legible in "sorrow and surrender." Highest resonance in earned ambiguity of transition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct ("gaze not on water but moonlight fractures"); rhythmic control under pressure ("water dripped... crabs scuttled... wind hummed"). Minor register drift in "liminal" risks academic tone but justified by chronicler's role. Dialogue sparse yet potent with subtext, though companion's voice lacks differentiation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "tremor of barnacles closing" exemplifies textural specificity. Figurative language precise ("moonlight fractured like memory shards") without muddle. One borderline cliché ("cosmos wheeled") instantly redeemed by concrete context. Final line’s propulsion elevates closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "time" trope through barnacle tremors and calcifying coral; emotional truth in unresolved migration conflict. Risk-taking with quiet closure pays off through tidal rhythm. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable—specific details (jade cicada, hermit crab hesitation) prevent abstraction. No derivative safety-hedging.</comment>
