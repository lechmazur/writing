<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "involuntarily truthful" trait forcing occlusion—a visible tradeoff when figures arrive. Final renunciation of the glass eye earns closure through prior causality (her growth with truffles), though secondary characters lack depth beyond pressure function.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: releasing the glass eye forecloses reliance on relics with felt cost ("she didn’t need to carry it anymore"). Orientation anchors by 120 words; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through mycelium’s "memory of balance" reconfiguring safety.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mycelium constrains choices (kneeling to harvest truffles) and charges the final image ("mycelium below... hold the memory of balance"). Sensory hierarchy excels—petrichor and decay mirror internal states without overt symbolism, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (psychological safety vs. truth-as-liability) tighten when figures arrive, forcing occlusion. Cost is legible in relinquishing the glass eye, though the empathy virus’s mechanics slightly abstract the pressure. Agency drives every escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "safety is not absence of threat, but presence of regulation" reweighted by the ending’s surrender to "quiet pulse beneath the storm." No moralizing—resonance crystallizes in the child’s laughter triggering no sob, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp ("moss-slick roots that arched like ribs"); syntax mirrors mental state ("wind howled... branch cracked"). One minor register drift ("fractured grace") barely dents rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "orchard creak like an old ship in a storm" exemplifies high-density imagery. Only "bruised clouds" risks cliché, but "dew and doubt" compensates with textural specificity. Propulsion never falters even in reflection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Empathy virus as contagion transforms post-apocalyptic tropes through truffle-based neural regulation—a fresh synthesis grounded in mycelium’s patience. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>
