<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: clinical precision ("perturbation theory") clashes with raw grief ("whispered names to crystal"). Motivation ("cartography of unused potential") intensifies through micro-choices like feeding geode resonance despite overload risks. No therapy-speak; embodied emotion via "silence that replaced her heartbeat" and "brittle, broken" smile.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "she would gather the unused potential... breathe into it until it remembered how to become" crystallizes stance with undeniable conceptual cost (eternal hunting). Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; pressure builds via density ("statistical ghosts of lives unlived") not causal turns. Orientation secured by word 20 with "zero-gravity halls" and "irradiated wedding site".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting as critical constraint: geode's "intangibly tangible" vibration of air molecules enables feeding resonance into mainframe, directly shaping the final coordinate hunt. Observatory's "mirrored domes refracting starlight into spectral grids" charges closure via "stars bent" during translational drive. Sensory details filtered through trauma-tuned perception ("whispering frequencies only nerves could interpret").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency: failed simulations narrow options to "empty" coordinates, forcing her to "queue thrusters" toward oceanic void. Cost crystallizes in "bleak certainty" replacing hope; circuit breakers' cooling becomes live clock tightening tactics. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via "mathematical echoes" reweighting dominant stake (proving potential pools elsewhere) with felt conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "gather unused potential like spilled mercury, cup it in palms, breathe until remembered how to become" reweights time as reservoir without stating moral. Final image "pooling in hollows between seconds" offers resonant non-literal answer to "does potential die?" Avoids Thematic Echo penalty by embedding philosophy in visceral verbs ("breathe," "cup," "gather").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct under pressure: scientific jargon ("perturbation fields") collides with trauma-tuned imagery ("violet filaments like captured auroras"). Rhythmic control evident in "intangibly tangible" paradox repetition serving thematic charge. Zero head-hopping; focalization stays anchored to survivor's embodied experience ("geode throbbed against palm, not warm, not cold").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via concrete verbs ("clutched," "throbbed," "shuddered"). Final line "pooling in the hollows between seconds" avoids cliché through specific physics metaphor. Minor deduction for "calibrated desperation" bordering abstraction, but earned by "suturing equations through grief" context. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms revenge trope via "statistical ghosts of lives unlived" merging quantum physics with grief. Emotional truth in "bleak certainty" replacing hope feels fresh, not quirky. Geode as "memory of universe that chose differently" synthesizes catastrophe and hope organically. Risk-taking (Accumulative lens for trauma story) heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure remains legible.</comment>
