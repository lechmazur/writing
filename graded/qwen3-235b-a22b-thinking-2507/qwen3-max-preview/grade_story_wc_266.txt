<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks flawed contradictions; guides' wisdom feels preordained. Strengths: embodied emotion (star-punch rhythm as metronome for soul), micro-choices under pressure (Torvin listening to bark's hollows). Final endurance lacks causal motivation—Elira's kneeling feels inevitable, not earned by struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise is flawless: star-punch holes in bread prove courage waits, with conceptual cost ("unused doesn’t mean lost"). Accumulative lens holds—density peaks at ridge’s crest (shoe/whistle artifacts), reweighting "leash breaks" into universal vigil. Orientation anchored by 80 words; twilight-to-dawn timeframe tightens stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (star-punch tool) constrains choices: perforating air/earth charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy shines ("tasted salt and silence on their tongues"), but "veiled ridgeway" lacks tangible pressure—moss/railings don’t alter tactics. Final star-holes in bread elevate closure with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Accumulative escalation: dominant "find unused courage" tightens as ridgeway erodes paths, forcing indirect routes. Cost is conceptual (courage as dormant potential), but pressure lacks narrowing options—guides never face failure. "Leash breaks" signals early, yet internal/external conflicts don’t interweave; tension stays textural.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally: final star-holes in bread reweight "unused courage" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite Elira’s "courage doesn’t rust"—grounded in action (kneeling by shoe), not abstraction. Lingered ambiguity: is courage found or projected? Closure image answers through charged specificity, not thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exemplary ("roots curled like question marks," salt/silence on tongues). Collective POV stable with intentional slippage; "they" focalization avoids head-hopping. Minor flaw: dialogue sparse but natural ("Here," Torvin murmured). Lexicon stays within guides’ wisdom—no register drift during peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sigh" motif evolves organically. Figurative language serves momentum ("sea mist swallowed sun’s last blush"). Near-miss: "half-remembered dreams" slightly abstract in high-pressure beat, but redeemed by concrete payoff (shoe/whistle). Final line avoids overwriting—"already on the next veiled ridgeway" charges closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "courage" trope through specific artifacts (tied-lace shoe, rusted whistle). Emotional truth in bravery as dormant potential—not heroic acts but "halting." Risk-taking (Accumulative lens, abstract stakes) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Derivative safety avoided: no middle-ground hedging on courage’s cost ("reserved—for when the leash breaks").</comment>
