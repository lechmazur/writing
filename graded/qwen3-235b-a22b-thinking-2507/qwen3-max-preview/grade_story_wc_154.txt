<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority masterfully concrete ("tremor in the lines, press of small fingers"), with contradictory impulses (fear of translation failing vs. need to witness) converging in the decryption act. Final choice to "let it breathe" earned by prior micro-choices, carrying felt cost of transformed burden.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: "lighter, not because pain vanished but learned to carry it with grace" crystallizes stance with conceptual price. Accumulative lens holds—density increase through coral/cast interaction reweights "shared anxieties" with visceral cost on final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Brain coral (micro-setting) constrains choice at climax—pressing it to cast triggers scribbles' transformation—while charging final image ("talisman of symbiosis"). Sensory specificity ("condensation refracting bruised twilight") filters through translator's tactile awareness, avoiding overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single tightening—decryption shifting frantic scribbles to calm curves—narrows options by transforming Mira's relationship to trauma. Cost is legible ("roots in fracture, petals unfurling when you stop trying to fix"), but dominant stake ("graft new meaning") lacks explicit earlier signal; escalation relies on atmospheric pressure rather than causal chain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through coral/cast reconfiguration: "kinship that blooms in saltwater" reweights war's "sutured" peace as symbiotic endurance. Final image ("coral cool and quiet... talisman of symbiosis") offers non-literal answer to "how to carry wounds," avoiding moralizing while charging prior motifs with earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("parsing ceasefire whispers," "decrypting scribbles with empathy") shapes every image. Rhythmic control under pressure: fragmented syntax ("spiral, slashes, stick-figure running") mirrors trauma, resolving into flowing cadence at closure without losing voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("anesthetic humming its lullaby" compresses time/state). Near-miss: "lotus-hearted ache" slightly abstract but redeemed by immediate concrete payoff ("roots in fracture, petals unfurling"). Final line’s "carry it with grace" risks sentimentality but saved by earned context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms war trauma trope through translator’s lens—decryption as empathy, coral as living archive. Fresh inflection: "shared anxieties braid into something that can bear weight" synthesizes personal/global stakes. Authenticity in avoiding redemption; pain remains but is metabolized through precise, verifiable details (charcoal smudges, cast textures).</comment>
