<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in key choice; motivation is clear but final renunciation lacks visible internal friction despite strong embodied emotion ("edges blurring like watercolor in rain"). Micro-choices under pressure are elegant but too singularly focused.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: dissolution isn't surrender but "invitation" with undeniable cost ("form thinned, edges blurring"). Causal lens holds from burning theater through sapling sprouting; cost proof anchored in "pressing translucent forehead to its trunk" as final action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard functions as micro-setting that charges closure: silver-barked sapling with "stage-light gold" leaves directly reweights possibility. Sensory details ("cerulean with flecks of brass") are character-particular and constrain choice by guiding her to the fountain.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: spinning coin narrows options to one decisive song. Cost is unmistakable in physical dissolution, but dominant stake ("lure possibility") lacks sufficient earlier friction—despair feels abstract until echoes emerge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment><comment>Final image ("sapling sprouted... blossoms that chimed") offers resonant non-literal answer to "luring possibility," reweighting "brink of despair" into "quiet courage." Avoids moralizing despite thematic echoes near closure ("kept luring possibility—not from despair, but courage").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: synesthesia filters all description ("laugh was cerulean with flecks of brass"). Rhythmic control under pressure ("She smiled. This was the thread she needed.") avoids lyric overwriting; no head-hopping in single-POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cracked open timelines like eggshells" is sole near-mixed metaphor. Propulsion flawless ("tossed the tarot coin into the fountain. It sank—not into water, but into possibility"), but "fractured timelines" phrasing slightly overworks early.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-as-echoes with synesthetic opera tropes. "Luring possibility from despair" risks cliché but transforms through specific mechanics (coin spinning, rooted echoes). Bold structural choice: multi-echo resolution deepens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
