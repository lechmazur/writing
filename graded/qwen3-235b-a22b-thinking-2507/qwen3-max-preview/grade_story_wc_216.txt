<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vey's timeless heartbeat creates visceral interiority with contradictory impulses (bureaucrat vs. curator), but Lira's grief lacks sufficient contradictory depth despite pivotal actions. Final heart-steadying beat earns closure with embodied cost, though secondary character development remains thin.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands flawlessly: urn fusion crystallizes Charged Poise where "time accumulates" reweights stakes with undeniable cost (Vey's reconnected heartbeat). Orientation perfect by para 2; Accumulative lens held through sensory density without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Emerald silo functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges closure: its ripples directly respond to urn vibration, while salt flats' refracted light mirrors time's fragmentation. Mother-of-pearl flecks provide tactile specificity that fuels the final garage sale listings.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation (textures → echoes → accumulated moments), narrowing options via Vey's choice to curate rather than fix time. Cost is visceral (reconnected heartbeat), but the "sudden timeless" trait lacks mid-beat tradeoffs despite clear climax payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>"Time accumulates like dust" emerges organically from concrete images (kitchen dance, balloon release), avoiding abstraction. Final listings reconfigure opening premise without moralizing—thematic resonance achieved through unsung lullabies and mud/snow boots rather than stated philosophy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("numbers whispered textures") and rhythmic control evident, though "borrowed-time timekeeper" risks register drift. Dual-POV segments maintain clean focalization, but Lira's voice lacks sufficient differentiation from Vey's during high-pressure fusion scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; "grain by grain, breath by breath" earns repetition. Minor metaphor friction in "whispered not of death, but of suspended moments" slightly dulls closure image, preventing 9.0 despite exceptional density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel tropes through sensory lens: "time breathing" and garage sales as emotional coordinates feel inevitable in hindsight. Avoids derivative pitfalls via salt flats specificity and mother-of-pearl details, though "borrowed-time" phrasing edges toward familiar lexicon.</comment>
