<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied grief ("vibrating with quiet intensity") and micro-choices like ribbon-tying, but "fiercely meditative" risks label-speak without sufficient contradictory impulses in peak beats. Silas' pressure elegantly forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost ("grief was not a void... but a current to be joined"), the Accumulative lens held through density escalation, and the persistent constraint of stone-carving shapes the final image. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The greenhouse rafters constrain choice (ribbon-tying) and charge closure, while the chisel functions as micro-setting that directly shapes tactics. Butterfly migration isn't backdrop but active pressure—every detail serves the grief geometry theme without ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elias' realization that grief has "angles of absence," with the migration timeframe tightening his urgency for the crimson ribbon. Agency in tying ribbons forecloses solitary grief, though the internal/external conflict interweaving could be sharper under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: ribbons as "loom for memory" reweights prior material without moralizing. The final image answers "shape of collective grief" by making migration tangible—no abstraction, no false binaries, pure earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable (carver noticing grooves, not petals), but one filter verb ("he realized") slightly dulls immediacy during the ribbon epiphany. Rhythmic control under pressure is masterful, with elision (Silas' silent guidance) taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but adjacent sentences ("unspooling like a sigh," "threads dyed bruised hues") create a mild paraphrase loop. Zero figurative muddle in peak beats—every image ("wings brushing panes like parchment") charges momentum without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes through specific, non-obvious synthesis: "grief's geometry" and ribbon loom feel inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking (silent mentorship, Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry—authenticity anchors universals in stone-carver's hands.</comment>
