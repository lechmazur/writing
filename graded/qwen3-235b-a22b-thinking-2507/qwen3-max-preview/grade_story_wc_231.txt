<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Interiority excels via sensory borrowing ("crunch of gravel under boots not his own"), but lacks contradictory impulses in climax; final choice feels inevitable without visible struggle against isolation or duty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("truths belong to the sea"), but fails cost-proof test—no exact sentence shows paid price; reliance on implication weakens Accumulative lens at critical moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Opal dock and Edelweiss constrain choices (waiting at twilight, tactile memory triggers) and charge final image; "mist curled like a question" exemplifies setting-as-pressure with zero ornamental detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Accumulative density (gap observations → memory shard), but cost remains abstract; Silas' agency passive until endpoint, missing visible price that alters tactics per band guardrails for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through Edelweiss' evolving role; final pinning beside photo answers "who owns unspoken truths?" without moralizing—pure subtext in "testament to softly persistent love that outlived both its givers".</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "sigh in a rusted hinge" and rhythm shifts with tension; minor cliché ("tide-worn stone") prevents 9.5, but compression ("crackled faintly with each breath") stays voice-coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density, but "alpine wind trapped in coastal gloom" risks figurative muddle in peak beat; near-miss for 9.0 due to one elevated phrase slightly obscuring immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "memory inheritance" trope through concrete sensory mechanics; risk-taking (Accumulative lens) heightens stakes, but lacks persistent constraint shaping tactics for 9.5+.</comment>
