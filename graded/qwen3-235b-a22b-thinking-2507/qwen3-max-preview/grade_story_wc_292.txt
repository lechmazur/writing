<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s "nervously confident" trait manifests concretely through trembling fingers and humming stanzas under alarms, not labels. Contradiction between exile shame and ancestral duty drives her climax choice to weave coordinates into the stanza, but internal conflict lacks deeper friction beyond duty vs. fear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sky cracking "with light, golden and slow" crystallizes earned reversal of exile through action, not pardon. Conceptual cost ("turned banishment into pilgrimage") is undeniable on-page, and Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density shift from decoding to humming’s cadence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The copper nail constrains choices (triggers transcription) and charges the final image ("quiet hum"), while the station’s resonance board forces tactile interaction. "Rain rose from the earth" embodies crisis-narrowed perception, but occupational detail (map librarian) lacks pressure relevance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when Elara realizes stanzas control weather, not predict it—narrowing options to immediate action. Agency-driven escalation (humming despite alarms) forecloses passive decoding, with visible cost in "turning banishment into pilgrimage," though fear-as-compass could deepen tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the nail’s evolution from talisman to proof to legacy, avoiding moralizing. Final line’s "maps... sung by storms" resonates as non-literal answer to "What do you want?", but "memory. grief. drowned sailors" risks near-allegory without sufficient prior particularity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("electric certainty that answers lay buried in ink and salt") and rhythmic control peak in the humming sequence. Elision of guild politics is taught early ("technically, exiled") and pays off in the exile reversal, with zero head-hopping despite storm’s voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "clouds unspooled backward" propels with high density. "Electric certainty" slightly edges toward clinical phrasing but avoids diagnostic labels. Final line’s cadence ("question the sky") recharges motifs without muddle, though "wept into steam" risks mild overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mapmaking as sonic legacy avoids weather-control tropes. The copper nail’s specificity (sea-burial casket, warmth progression) transforms exile into pilgrimage, with risk-taking in Accumulative lens heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
