<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shown through action (ink-stained fingers tracing wood grain) but lacks contradictory impulses; motivation rooted in covenant yet flawlessly serene, missing struggle that would deepen Earned Stasis. Final choice feels inevitable but untested by internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: star piercing unbroken into canal crystallizes the "darkness as audience" reconfiguration with palpable cost in the guardian’s perpetual half-spoken vigil. Accumulative lens holds through shutter-glyph intensification narrowing options to silent weaving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cobalt dock’s rain-slicked planks actively constrain tactics (reflecting light for glyphs), while the dental mirror as micro-setting charges closure when dew-wiped to reveal the piercing star. Environment isn’t backdrop—it’s the canvas for the thematic battle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen organically from teaching darkness to the drowned woman’s arrival, but escalation relies on external catalyst rather than protagonist’s agency. Guardian’s "weave faster" reaction lacks tactical trade-offs; cost (eternal vigilance) is felt but not actively chosen under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action—shutter-glyphs making darkness "audience"—not moralizing. Final star image answers "can light persist in swallowing dark?" with unbroken light, reweighting the covenant without stating a moral. Avoids false binaries through nuanced empathy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: light/water metaphors ("drowned sapphire," "liquid silver") filter all observation. "Spiralingly calm" as rhythmic motif intensifies under pressure. Slight register drift in "covenant with the drowned" edges toward abstraction in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cobalt dock after rain glistened like a drowned sapphire" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Figurative language serves pressure ("lamplight’s mercy," "shutter-clicks soft as moth wings") without muddle. Final star image crystallizes with surgical clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "guardian of drowned" trope through dental mirror as empathy tool and darkness as pupil. Specificity (constellations carved on handle, cobalt dock’s bruised clouds) creates freshness. Risk-taking: silence as active dialect heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
