<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira’s retrocognitive trap manifests as embodied contradiction—trembling hands pried tesserae while reliving others’ grief—making her motivation visceral. Micro-choices (biting palm, renaming aloud) reveal hierarchy of values, but secondary characters lack sufficient pressure to fully test her stance beyond the magistrate’s brief interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the plaza humming with purpose crystallizes the shift from passive to "aberrant mercy" with conceptual cost (magistrate’s whispered vulnerability). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—the density shift from solitary act to communal renaming reweights stakes without causal breaks, though one more intensification beat would elevate escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The tessera functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (must be pried, handled, placed) and charges the final image—its cobalt shard in Elira’s belt as "compass" reweights the plaza’s identity. Ash, fractured arches, and stepping stone patterns mirror internal states without overt symbolism, fulfilling the 9+ gate requirement flawlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when the magistrate demands silence, forcing Elira’s core choice: place the tessera in his hand instead of arguing. This narrowing of options (confrontation → embodied invitation) crystallizes the "aberrant mercy" concept with visible cost—his trembling throat and whispered vulnerability—driven entirely by her agency under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through renaming actions ("grief" to "love that outlived its vessel"), avoiding moralizing. The final image—"steel that bends but does not break"—resonantly answers the mercy question without stating a moral, though Elira’s speech risks thematic echo but is redeemed by the tessera placement action making it concrete.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elira’s tactile focus on tesserae textures and ash ("powdered grief") reflects her rebuilding trauma. Rhythmic control under pressure shines in the cadence shift during renaming ("beggar" to "keeper of stories"), with lyric compression taught early and paid off in the communal hum—zero head-hopping despite multi-POV fragments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with minimal scaffold—"cobalt blue, fractured at one edge, its glaze still shimmering with stubborn light" layers setting, emotion, and theme. Near-cliché "powdered grief" is the sole artifact, but rhythm varies purposefully (e.g., short staccato lines during the magistrate confrontation) without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "mercy" trope through specific synthesis: tesserae as legal/emotional building blocks and renaming as actionable justice. The "aberrant mercy" concept feels inevitable in hindsight—Elira’s steel-cradled empathy grows from prior details (calloused hands, children starving while lords prayed)—with risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
