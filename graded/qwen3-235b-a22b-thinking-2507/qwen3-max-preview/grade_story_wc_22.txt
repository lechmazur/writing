<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "motivation was neither vengeance nor absolution, but restoration," with embodied micro-choices like planting where names were forgotten. No second character limits relationship dynamics, but single-POV baseline excels through concrete sensory choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost in "patches of dark earth he’d sown" and "heartbeats waiting beneath soil." Accumulative lens holds perfectly; density escalates through bird-call dialogue tightening stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Jetty’s moss-furred planks constrain planting choices, while recurring seed pods charge the final image. Micro-setting (tin of ash, soil between slats) directly alters tactics, meeting 9+ gate via environment charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reweaving memory through growth) tightens via planting sequence where "hollow where laughter should echo" crystallizes cost. Escalation driven by protagonist’s ritual deepens knowledge, though one tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image ("sprouts... heartbeats beneath soil") offers resonant answer to "what might yet grow" without moralizing. Theme emerges through moonvine/weepwillow specifics, avoiding abstraction while embracing complexity of "forgetting just enough to begin again."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("sighing underfoot like a tired lung") and rhythmic control peak in bird-call exchanges. Voice modulates from "brittle as forgotten vows" to "lullabies of root and rain" without elision issues; Lydian/Etruscan choices deepen focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "dust that smelled of monsoons and monasteries." Minor deduction for "latent green scream" slightly muddling immediacy in high-pressure beat, but closure remains razor-sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms ecological restoration trope through "submerged concord" mechanics and Lydian/tern dialogue. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation as primary drive) heightens stakes coherently; specificity of "Carian for courage" avoids generic universals.</comment>
