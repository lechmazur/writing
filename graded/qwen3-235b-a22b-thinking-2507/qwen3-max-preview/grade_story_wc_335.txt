<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Archivist’s "combative tenderness" manifests through grit-not-glue mentorship (sliding chipped cup, annotating sideways), avoiding therapy-speak; her "refusal to apologize for missteps" philosophy drives the cartographer’s recalibration with visible cost in the delta-shaped leaves.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: the shadow’s containment ("holds. For now") crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost (exile’s fragility), while the cartographer’s shifting tea leaves reconfigure resilience through accumulated pressure, all under a consistent Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The afternoon shadow (constraining exile mechanics) and tea leaves (shifting from siege spiral to delta) charge the final image, with sensory details like "bergamot-stained oolong" filtered through the archivist’s topological reading of history.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation via the "hush" moment tightens stakes—when the swing’s absence forces the library to "listen hardest," the archivist’s exile flickers, narrowing her options to precise tea-leaf annotation under palpable cost ("void between seconds").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the cartographer’s redrawn coastlines: "stopped needing to" the lost city reweights resilience as releasing false wholeness, avoiding moralizing while charging the final swing image with earned ambiguity about absence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in topological time ("curl of oolong predicting rebellion"), with rhythmic control under pressure ("heart quiet" amid exile risks); dialogue’s subtext ("Not what. Where.") avoids ventriloquism through archivist-specific lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in lines like "fracture isn’t in the city. It’s in the hand that drew it" propels momentum, though "settling dust" risks cliché but is redeemed by concrete stakes in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ingenuity in transforming exile into a reversible state calibrated by tea geometry feels inevitable, with the swing’s "hush" reconfiguring absence as active mentorship ("push it anyway")—bold risk that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
