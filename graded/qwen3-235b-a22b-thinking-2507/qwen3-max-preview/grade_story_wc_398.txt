<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's vineyard metaphors concretely embody his evolution from seeking alignment to valuing asymmetry; Mara's brittle "I didn't want to" reveals contradictory impulses. Final choice to walk together—no reconciliation but shared rediscovery—feels earned through the vine imagery. Micro-choice of offering the letter as "compass" crystallizes thematic stakes without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "space between them was no longer a chasm but a vineyard row—fertile, intentional, alive" reconfigures their history with visible cost (Mara's admission "I thought I was rejecting you"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory accumulation (leaves, vines, grapes), with orientation anchored by line 3 ("vacant station... amber pavilion").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Amber pavilion constrains choice by casting "honeyed light" enabling the final silhouette image; frost-stained grapes charge closure via tactile "juice stained her fingers. Sweet." Vineyard setting actively shapes dialogue (Merlot/Pinot pruning contrasts). Avoids white-room syndrome through purposeful sensory hierarchy (woodsmoke scent, crunch of leaves).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether mismatched love can be redefined—tightens through Elias's vine analogy ("They don't match... but together they bear fruit"), narrowing options from "failure" to "mattered." Cost is visceral: Mara's emotional shift from "arms crossed" to taking his hand. Agency entirely character-driven under accumulative lens; one hairline slip in Mara's rapid emotional shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Destined mismatches" emerges organically from vineyard observations, never stated outright. Final train whistle ("not departure, but possibility") offers non-literal resolution reweighting the burned letter's meaning. Avoids thematic echo: Mara's "we were meant to be... differently" feels character-specific, not prompt-like moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's poetic dirt-encrusted diction ("poetry wrapped in dirt") contrasts Mara's brittle delivery; free indirect style blends seamlessly ("scent of woodsmoke clinging... as if she'd stepped from a pyre"). No register drift under stress. One borderline moment: "scorched fragment" descriptor edges toward slight overwriting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Leaves skittered like secrets across stone" avoids cliché through precise verb choice; zero paraphrase loops. One borderline moment: "yearning, misalignment, the ache" risks thematic echo but saved by concrete context ("fire cannot fully erase"). Sentence rhythm varies naturally with scene urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "rekindled lovers" trope through vineyard-specific metaphors (Pinot Noir welcoming pruning vs. Merlot resisting). Avoids safety middle by having no reconciliation—only rediscovery. Fresh inflection: burned letter as "map of what could still grow" feels inevitable in hindsight. One point shy of 9.0 for near-standard autumnal setting.</comment>
