<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "mind unshackled" vs. physical chains; micro-choices like pressing keys "like a promise" reveal hierarchy of values. Lacks visible flaw-driven mistakes that compound under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: scattering seeds while "raiders would come at first light" crystallizes stakes with felt cost (spores pressed into vault cracks). Drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through sensory density crescendo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Carnival setting constrains choices (piano bench key arrangement), while the arrow's fletching charges the final image ("green" as heartbeat). Dust motes "dancing like pollen" exemplifies purpose-driven sensory hierarchy under crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Temporal pressure ("wall coming down tomorrow") tightens tactics, narrowing options to one decisive breach. Cost is unmistakable: spores in vault cracks, seeds heavier than chains. Agency drives escalation through key-decoding deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically from "soil remembers blood/prayers" to "sow hope in cracks"—no moralizing. Final "green" image reweights prior material as non-literal answer to "can resilience grow in barrenness?" without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "calloused fingers," "breath stirring dust motes" reflect agrarian POV. Rhythmic control peaks in vault sequence ("C. E-flat. G. B-flat.") with compression taught early through humming.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("her strategy complete, her grace staggering—not because she moved like a dancer, but like soil after rain"). Figurative language ("dust motes that danced like pollen") serves momentum without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms "lone liberator" trope through soil-memory motif and "staggering grace" as embodied strategy. Specificity ("mycorrhizal spores," "acorn-shaped bow") synthesizes ecological precision with emotional truth.</comment>
