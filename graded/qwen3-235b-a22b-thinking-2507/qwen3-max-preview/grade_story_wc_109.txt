<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her obsession with absence versus action, but some emotional descriptions verge on abstraction ("honeyed resin trapping ancient breath") without sufficient physical embodiment during high-pressure moments like the star's fading.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully when she enters the mapped night, with conceptual cost legible in "time measured in sighs" and the final star's extinction. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density escalation of summarized silences.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Storm-tossed ridge fort actively pressures choices (wind threatening the booklet, waves as battering rams), while the flaking gold leaf booklet functions as micro-setting that constrains her actions and charges the final image of "flaking gold upon the stones."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate meaningfully as the dying star tightens time pressure, but the abstract nature of "mapping silence" slightly dilutes visceral urgency despite clear cost in her physical endurance and the star's extinction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete acts of summarizing silences; the final image ("someone... would find her coordinates") reweights the premise with conceptual cost without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo entirely.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("voice... as a stone exists in a riverbed") and rhythmic control under storm pressure showcase exceptional voice discipline; no head-hopping or register drift despite lyrical density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless line craft with purposeful variation in sentence rhythm and zero paraphrase loops; minor risk of purple prose in "bruised horizon" is mitigated by consistent voice-motivated metaphor throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "map of silence" transforms oracle trope through specific physical acts (tracing pages, summarizing pauses); risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry, though emotional specificity slightly edges toward abstraction.</comment>
