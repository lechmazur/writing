<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via embodied emotion ("giddy sorrow, a bittersweet wind") and micro-choices (pressing seed to temple), but lacks contradictory impulses during pivotal crater glass vision where stakes peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "She didn’t need to solve... carry it" reconfigures the mystery with visible cost (wearing "missing pieces as adornments"). Accumulative lens holds flawlessly through seed-to-glass progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Crystal cave actively constrains choices (seeds lodged in crevices) and charges the finale ("dawn’s light seeped like liquid honey"), but one decorative simile ("liquid honey") slightly dilutes momentum at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through transliteration uncertainty ("conjecture, a guess stitched from emotional residue"), with cost legible in her transformed stance; escalation lacks one micro-struggle when handling crater glass.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action (planting seeds for children) and image ("scattering conjectures like confetti"), avoiding all moralizing while reweighting "cheerful gloom" as the story’s core paradox.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("laughter echoing like bubbles popping") and rhythmic control peak during crater glass vision ("a child running... vanishing"), with no head-hopping despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "giddy sorrow" compresses emotion perfectly. Minor density dip in "prismatic halos that danced" risks slowing tempo but is redeemed by salt-crusted skin’s tactility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "memory keeper" trope via seed-based transliteration mechanics; "paths disappear only so new ones can be sung" synthesizes premise with emotional specificity, though cheerful gloom risks slight quirkiness.</comment>
