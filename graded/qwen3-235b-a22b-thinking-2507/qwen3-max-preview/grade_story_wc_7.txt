<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in pruning "not with defeat, but surrender" and watering with memory instead of tears. Final choice to let the fruit grow crooked earns resonance through prior causal chain of tasting grief into usefulness, with visible cost in vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the crooked sapling bearing sensory glyphs crystallizes options with undeniable cost (Elara’s "rebellion" requiring surrender). Orientation anchors immediately ("rusted greenhouse" by word 5), and Accumulative lens holds through synaptic plasticity’s tangible effects on memory-tasting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rusted greenhouse constrains every choice—from seed placement at "rust meets root" to roots "threading into iron" reinforcing weakness. Final image charges closure as vines "no longer choked—they framed," making environment indispensable to the earned stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elara’s internal pressure: pruning archives of grief risks being overwhelmed, yet the celestial alignment’s urgency tightens her micro-choices (e.g., watering with specific memory). Cost legible in her vulnerability during planting, though external pressure lacks teeth for higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "rebellion doesn’t always shout—it can simmer" via pruning-as-curation, not stated moral. Final image reweights premise with conceptual cost ("heavy not with fruit, but with stories"), avoiding sentimentality through sensory glyphs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: "taste of memories" filters all observation ("bitter tang of heartbreak," "buttery warmth of lullaby"). Rhythmic control under pressure in pruning beats ("slow, deliberate snips") with no head-hopping; voice modulates from clinical ("synaptic plasticity") to lyrical ("stitched silver threads").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "leaves unfolding like scrolls" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor register drift in "synaptic plasticity" (clinical term amid poetic voice) prevents 9.5, but closure image ("branches heavy with stories") avoids figurative muddle with visceral specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality in transforming "knowledge fruit" trope: not for omniscience but "resonance," growing stories not fruit. Fresh synthesis of chef/gardener roles via memory-tasting makes premise inevitable, with risk-taking (lyric Accumulative lens) heightening stakes without obscurity.</comment>
