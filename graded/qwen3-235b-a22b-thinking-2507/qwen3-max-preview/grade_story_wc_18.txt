<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "dreams, like glass, reflect only when properly angled, and shatter when mishandled" – embodied emotion via trembling hands (not cold) and micro-choices like refusing to reach for the dream. Final renunciation of future pursuits ("no dream would dare flee") carries visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: fog thickening after capture crystallizes irreversible cost ("no dream would dare flee") under accumulative lens. Orientation anchors by word 20; causal escalation via breathing rhythm narrows options to single decisive exhale. Cost proof: "cradling the completed piece" as isolation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (fog) constrains every choice – only works at "shimmer of twilight frost" – and charges closure as thickening fog. "Ozone — the scent of thresholds thinning" integrates setting with action; apple blossoms erupting where sextant light touches shows environmental causality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by protagonist’s breathing agency (inhale/hold/exhale counts) under accumulative lens. Dominant stake (capturing dream) tightens through sextant’s harmonic resonance, culminating in felt cost: her final craft implies eternal solitude. No coincidence resolves tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "glass mountains" motif – "refracting truth into facets too brilliant to behold" – resolving into non-literal closure: obsidian glass holding the dream reweights truth’s burden without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite poetic density.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "bruised violet sky" and "petrified sentinels" shows character-specific noticing. Rhythmic control peaks in breathing cadence ("inhale seven, hold three, exhale eleven"), though slight register drift in "calibrated arcs fractured" disrupts artisan voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffold; "frost on grass pulsed faintly, glowing blue" exemplifies multi-jobbing lines. Minor cadence repetition in "With each exhale... With each inhale..." serves accumulative lens but slightly dulls propulsion. No figurative muddle in peak capture beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms dream-capture trope via sextant’s harmonic resonance and "obsidian glass, polished to a void." Fresh inflection in astronomer’s broken tool enabling boundary-erasure. "Glass mountains" tone feels singular, avoiding abstract everywhere-ness through orchard specificity.</comment>
