<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority vividly concrete ("nails bit her palms") but lacks layered contradictory impulses in peak action; micro-choices like unpredictable steps reveal value hierarchy yet the core conflict between purification/preservation remains stated rather than embodied through simultaneous competing urges during the humming climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly—"lighter, not because grief gone but no longer owned"—with felt cost in bloodied palms and weeping; Accumulative lens holds through nostalgia atoms' density escalation culminating in the flawed melody's release, reconfiguring the forgetting cycle with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bronze pagoda constrains the climax (humming against its resonance chamber function) and charges the final image as it cools; dust settling into "new configurations" embodies earned stasis, with micro-setting details like "shelves tilting like broken ribs" directly affecting movement and stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (does forgetting heal?) tightens through the historian’s humming—a profound escalation under Accumulative lens where her arrhythmic song confuses nostalgia atoms, narrowing options to "raw truth" with visible cost in bloodied palms and weeping.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: the final image of her turning toward the exit with "raw, patternless truth" reweights the archive’s history without moralizing; "anguished joy" concept avoids sentimentality by rooting in her daughter’s silence and the pagoda’s cooling, resisting tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust of lost civilization," "molten regret") modulates rhythm under pressure with purposeful fragments ("then pause, then right knee lowered"); no head-hopping, though "galaxies of unshed tears" slightly drifts toward abstract diction in high-stakes moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "shelves tilting like broken ribs" demonstrates textural specificity, though "molten regret and violet surrender" risks abstract diction during twilight description—saved by immediate anchoring in bronze pagoda’s physicality and historian’s embodied action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via "atoms of nostalgia" as physical entities and purification through flawed humming; "steadily unpredictable" movement as rebellion against patterns feels inevitable in hindsight, with emotional specificity avoiding generic templates through the daughter’s silenced trauma.</comment>
