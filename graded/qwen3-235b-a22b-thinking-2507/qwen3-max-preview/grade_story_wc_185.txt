<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied choices (reading floor like braille) and concrete contradiction: seeking quiet amid chaos without weapon. Final offering of hush as refusal to flee earns visible cost through the melting ice wall’s metronome drip.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the cradled stone reconfigures the being’s state with undeniable conceptual cost (storm "tuned," not banished). Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ice fractures → hum → bloom tighten pressure through sensory density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Harmonic caves constrain every choice—their resonance dictates Ripple-mark’s pitch adjustments. The echo chamber stone (micro-setting) charges the final image as lunar-glow vessel, while ice fractures literally score the solution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Ripple-mark’s agency: matching ice harmonics narrows options to a single pitch. Cost is legible in the melting ice wall’s drip-metronome, reweighting the dominant stake (chaos → balanced breath) via textural deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ice’s "scores" and the "tuned" storm—no moralizing. Final image (being cradling stone like an egg) offers resonant answer: silence as architecture, not absence. Avoids false balance; energy beings aren’t villains.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is immaculate: "cartographic whorls," "reading floor like braille." Rhythm mirrors pressure—staccato cracks vs. "moss unfurling" hush. Zero head-hopping; lexicon stays grounded in cave-rock serenity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsion-driven ("screamed" → "breathe"). One near-loop ("shudders, but sighs" / "slow and inevitable") prevents 9.0+. Final line’s "listening for the next fracture" crystallizes closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "silence as weapon" trope through ice-crack scores and geological time. Risk-taking (no dialogue, sensory-only conflict) heightens stakes coherently. "Tuned storm" synthesis feels inevitable, avoiding abstract universality.</comment>
