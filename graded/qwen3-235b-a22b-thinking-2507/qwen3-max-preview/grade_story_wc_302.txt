<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority remains atmospheric rather than psychologically deep; "cautious exuberance" is embodied but lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal moments like the mirror confrontation where motivation blurs into archetype.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands flawlessly: "she became the archive" reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost, while the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through recursive pressure that tightens via documentation's ripple effects.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The hollow bone stylus functions as micro-setting that literally constrains choice (etching glyphs on skin) and charges the final image; mist thickening into sentences directly shapes navigation and closure's mirror revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation through textural density ("mist coiled into grammatical structures") reweights the dominant stake with visceral cost; protagonist's documentation choices narrow options as shelves rearrange, culminating in the felt price of becoming the archive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Final mirror scene offers resonant non-literal answer to "why seek the unsaid?" through past seekers wearing her face—thematic wisdom emerges from concrete glyphs like "too late," avoiding moralizing while charging prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable: "mist thickened into sentences" filters reality through textual bias; rhythmic control under pressure ("watch now silent, its hands fused at midnight") modulates with emotional stakes without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances multiple dimensions ("glyphs bloomed on her skin: not words, but their shadows" conveys action, theme, and atmosphere without figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Transforms library tropes through specific rules (propagation delays); the seekers-becoming-archive synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh, with emotional truth rooted in visceral details like etching "I tried" into flesh.</comment>
