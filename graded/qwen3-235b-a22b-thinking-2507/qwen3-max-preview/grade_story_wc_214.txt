<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in his rejection of cosmic order for "flourishing stillness," embodied through micro-choices like kneeling with lantern glass to trace comet intent. Tears "not of grief, but recognition" avoid therapy-speak while showing earned vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: his return to sweeping after the comet’s dissolution forecloses path to institutional validation with visible cost (tears of recognition). Accumulative lens holds as density peaks with the rogue comet’s efflorescence reweighting "impermanence" into sacred vulnerability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The yellow lantern glass constrains choice and charges closure—it’s his lens for tracing stars, then pivotal for witnessing the comet’s unraveling. Final image of it "glowing faintly" recharges prior motifs while "star-dust" sweeping grounds cosmic scale in tactile action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through his method: "tracing paths" shifts from archival duty to sacred witnessing, narrowing options to vulnerability. Cost is unmistakable in tears during the comet’s dissolution, though protagonist agency in escalation feels slightly passive under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "flourishing stillness" evolves from poet’s journal to lived truth in the comet’s "silent bloom." Final whisper—"Thank you for remembering how to be still"—resonates without moralizing, reweighting vulnerability as strength through earned experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: "velvet dark," "fraying brilliance," and "gravitational sigh" filter cosmos through janitor’s empathetic lens. Rhythmic control peaks during comet observation ("hesitant, then plunged") with zero head-hopping despite reflective backstory.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "star-dust" metaphor evolves from literal to thematic without muddle. One borderline anthropomorphism ("atmosphere kissed it") slightly blurs physics, but "efflorescence" and "ink in water" sustain lyrical precision through climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms cosmic clichés via janitor’s anti-heroism: sweeping star-dust as sacred act reframes entropy as release. The lantern glass’s evolution from dead-moon relic to soul-lens feels inevitable, with emotional specificity ("vulnerability wearing radiant armor") avoiding abstraction.</comment>
