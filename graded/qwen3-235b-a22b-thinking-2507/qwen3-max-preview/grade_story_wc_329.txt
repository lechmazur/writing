<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied choices (blistered fingers, resonantly soft pressure) not labels; micro-turns like statues lowering spears reveal shifting values with cost. Final renunciation—walking toward silenced places—earns closure through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: blistered hands, spent locust shell, and "tarnished wonder... molting" reweights the premise under Accumulative lens. Orchards sighing awake crystallizes stakes without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Enchanted orchard constrains every choice—the locust shell’s texture alters music’s impact, and statues’ stone softening charges the final image. Dew-weeping and sapling sprouting evolve causally with plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: "resonantly soft" pressure seeps into statues’ vigilance, narrowing options as moss cracks and saplings sprout. Cost is legible in blistered fingers and the shell’s dissolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: locust shell’s molting reweights "beauty hides in husks" without moralizing. Final apple bite offers resonant answer—beauty was waiting, not broken—avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bow trembling," "tart flesh like baptism") with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; voice modulates from "trembling A" to "music poured out like blood."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("dew from eye sockets, pooling... nurturing shoots"). Sentences vary rhythm ("She played not to defy, but to signal") with no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "music heals" trope via tactile specificity: locust shell’s brittle crackle rewires stakes. "Tarnished wonder" tone synthesizes decay/rebirth, avoiding safety-middle with bold molting metaphor.</comment>
