<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses manifest in real-time micro-choices (disguising wisdom as foolishness while weaving war maps), with closure choice earned through prior causality. Slight competence elevation lacks genuine struggle but doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis with undeniable cost ("swift and brutal" coup violence), while Accumulative lens holds through density increase in embroidery patterns. Flame's cobalt core crystallizes the conceptual cost cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cobalt observatory and eternal candle constrain every key choice (flame guides needle, observatory becomes sanctuary), charging the final image where "eternal flame now burning steady." Micro-setting drives closure causality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (preventing coup) tightens through protagonist's agency—synchronizing with flame to step into adjacent possibilities. Cost is unmistakable in coup's brutality and her gasping return from the echo-chamber.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "each thread was a lie to save a truth" reweights at closure where "wisdom need not shout to win." Final image ("needle still moves") resonates without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("amber leaves scraped... like fingernails on slate") and rhythmic control under pressure ("She did not gasp, did not flee"). Patterned elision (adjacent possibilities) taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with "crimson on indigo" charging climax. Figurative language serves pressure ("stitch faster, weaving counter-patterns") without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of embroidery as conspiracy detection feels inevitable. Risk-taking (adjacent possibilities via aurora tapestry) heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming familiar tropes through specific stakes.</comment>
