<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in peak moments; locksmith's unwavering resolve reads archetypal despite vivid embodied choices like tying the crimson ribbon as a "symbol. A promise." No internal friction during mirror confrontation weakens final endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "frost of centuries-old dread" melting syncs with the idea's pulse, reconfiguring "broken worlds" through love. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density shifts from cosmic dust to stardust mirrors without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Shadowed nexus constrains choice by demanding non-physical solutions (hair lock vs. tools), while the crimson ribbon charges the final image as a "symbol. A promise." Moss "that remembered ancient footsteps" embodies setting-as-memory with tactical consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation through accumulating pressure: cosmic hum → fractured moonstone → star-guided thread → weeping mirror reflections. Agency tightens options via locksmith's micro-choices (withdrawing ribbons), but fear's cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt in key beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: love reweaving worlds crystallizes via the "newborn bird" idea's physical glow against his chest. Avoids moralizing by embedding insight in liberation act, though "love... could reweave" risks slight thematic echo as diegetic discovery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "moss that remembered ancient footsteps" and "ribbons tied with faded blue silk," filtering cosmos through tactile intimacy. Rhythmic control sustains under pressure: short clauses during mirror confrontation ("He did not flinch") deepen urgency without voice slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffolding; "cosmic dust and whispered histories" exemplifies high-density imagery. One borderline overwritten phrase ("air disoriented around him—not violently, but tenderly, like a dream shifting mid-sleep") slightly muddles the disorientation beat without harming closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "freeing an idea" trope through specific, embodied mechanics: hair lock as memory-key, stardust mirrors reflecting fear. Emotional truth anchors cosmic scale in "cupped the idea gently in his palms," avoiding abstraction while synthesizing mythic and intimate stakes.</comment>
