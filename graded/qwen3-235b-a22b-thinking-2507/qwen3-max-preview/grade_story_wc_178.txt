<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied micro-choices: selling winter cloak for lamp oil, barley cakes over feasts. Final "Confirmed" crystallizes endurance with visible cost (trembling hands, protesting knees) without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: "whispered 'Confirmed'" forecloses path with felt cost (physical sacrifice, anonymity). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density peaks when tile hums and Sirius kisses horizon, reweighting devotion as cosmic necessity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (tile) charges closure: shifts from "dormant god" to resonant artifact absorbed by stones. Obsidian floor chalk lines evolve causally (stirred by breeze), constraining choices through orbital diagrams that mirror celestial mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist’s agency: selling cloak/eating barley cakes alters tactics, narrowing options to pure attention. Cost crystallizes in "knees protesting" and "trembled—not from age"—visible tradeoffs that reweight devotion as non-negotiable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "encrypted devotion" shown via chalk schematics, not stated. Final image ("pulsed like a neutron star—unseen, unpraised") reweights longing as essential cosmic rhythm without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature dominates: "time slowed like syrup under moonlight," "barley cakes while scribes feasted." Rhythmic control under pressure ("He did not smile. He did not weep.") avoids uniformity; elision (omitting regime chaos) taught early via "between regimes" motif.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion via concrete verbs ("uncloaked," "aligned," "adjusted"). Minor deduction for "empirically ironic" bordering on label in one instance, but "dusky harmony of shadow and calculation" exemplifies textural specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms tropes: magic square as physics-uncovered, devotion as data decryption. "Frugal, ferocious faith of one who counts the infinite" synthesizes specificity (barley cakes, chalk dust) into fresh emotional truth—no safety-hedging.</comment>
