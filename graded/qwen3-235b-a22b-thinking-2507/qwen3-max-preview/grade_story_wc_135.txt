<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in archivist's embodied process ("salt clinging like forgotten prayers"); "reactively visionary" trait drives key choices without label-speak; closure shows earned endurance through the unpolished valve's symbolic cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ritual's first performance crystallizes options with visceral cost ("valve cold in her palm"); Accumulative lens holds throughout with pattern-break in council scene reweighting stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Harbor actively constrains choices (brine preserving "truths ink could not"); trumpet valve's physicality charges final image ("rust untouched beneath open sky"), meeting 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elira's methodology ("staggered intervals" deepening trust), culminating in proposal that forecloses memorialization paths; cost legible in unpolished valve's enduring presence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (naming vs statues), not abstraction; final image reweights "navigated absences" into "compiled, note by note" without moralizing, satisfying Q5 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in archivist's selective noticing ("chalk drawing of ship with no sails"); rhythmic control modulates under pressure ("salt-warped ledgers leaned beside coral-crusted sextants").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density with propulsion ("brine preserved truths ink could not"); no figurative muddle even in peak beats like the ritual's crystallization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope through specific methodology ("navigation chart of memory"); risk-taking (silence as harbor) heightens stakes without gimmickry, meeting Q8 9+ test.</comment>
