<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("terminally curious" not suicidal) and embodied emotion ("gripping reality loosely") powerfully drive the glacier climax. Micro-choices like the parasol tap reveal value hierarchy, but secondary characters lack pressure on Elara’s core conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: her changed life path after the glacier sigh. Orientation anchors marina/storm by word 20; Accumulative escalation through sensory density reweights stakes without causal breaks, culminating in the floe drift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina actively constrains choices (black ice slip, floe acceptance) and charges the final image. Micro-setting—the parasol tip’s vibration—reweights the "fold in patience" concept, elevating beyond atmospheric description to causal pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative density (creak of hulls → glacier sigh) narrows Elara’s focus to the threshold moment. Cost is legible in her post-closure actions (declining euthanasia, hospice work), though the "trawl" metaphor slightly softens tangible stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: lace unraveling = patience folding. The ending’s "thresholds that sing" reweights the euthanasia quest without moralizing, offering resonant ambiguity about endings as transitions, not events.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("soul rinsed in Arctic brine") and rhythmic control peak during the glacier collapse ("a sigh, a slow exhalation"). Voice modulates from lyrical to sparse under pressure, with zero head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "low, wet chime like a bell submerged" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor deduction: "terminally curious" borders on label-speak but is redeemed by immediate embodiment in the ice slip.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms euthanasia tropes through sonic metaphor ("sound of approaching endings"). The "fold in patience" concept synthesizes fresh emotional truth with the marina’s physicality, avoiding abstraction while risking Accumulative structure.</comment>
