<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses during pivotal forgery; "covenant of pain" shows embodied cost yet "wisely enduring" isn't tested until climax. Motivation ("forgive the unfinished") remains poignant but told rather than dramatized through competing desires mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a flawless Conceptual Repricing: the dawn-colored rose bud reweights "pearl twilight" from mourning to awakening with undeniable conceptual cost (her erased anonymity). Accumulative lens holds through sensory escalation (dripping rhythm, aurora flares), but "calibrated treason" concept isn't fully pressure-tested until the final stroke.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sanctuary functions as active constraint: marble vault necessitates the comet-key, stalactites impose a live clock, and the thorn charges closure. Micro-setting mastery—thorn isn't ornamental but indispensable for ink and the final bud. Minor deduction for "mother-of-pearl veins" description bordering on atmospheric excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (inherited guilt vs. redemption) tighten through textural escalation: drips accelerate, scroll resists, aurora flares—all narrowing options via sensory pressure. Cost (anonymity) is viscerally legible in "kingdom would never know her name." Deduction because the drought-sin rule isn't dramatized beyond the scroll rewrite.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action—no thematic echo. The rose bud answers "can inherited shame be unlinked?" by reweighting forgiveness as embodied grace. Final image avoids moralizing, but "covenant of pain willingly borne" risks abstraction, barely escaping penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: calligrapher's eye for ligatures/serifs, ink chemistry. Rhythm mirrors pressure (staccato during forgery: "ink writhed, letters bled"). Deduction for one near-mixed metaphor ("breath misting as stalactites drip") slightly muddying immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "calibrated treason" avoids cliché, sentence rhythm varies with emotional intensity. Deduction for "soft lavenders, muted golds..."—overwrought description momentarily stalls momentum in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "forger hero" trope via calligraphic stakes; "calibrated treason" reframes moral calculus as grace. Emotional truth in "forgiving the unfinished" avoids sentimentality. Deduction because "heritage rose thorn" leans tropey despite strong execution.</comment>
