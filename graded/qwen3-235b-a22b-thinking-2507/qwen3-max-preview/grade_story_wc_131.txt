<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("invisibility was slow erosion of soul" vs. "didn't need to emerge") embodied in micro-choices like placing the tape as "sacrament," not salvage. Final endurance (Earned Stasis) earned through caching ritual's reverence, with visible cost in dust-streaked tears.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is flawless Charged Poise: "She didn't need to emerge. Not yet. But she would" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost (emotional vulnerability) in "tears streaking dust." Orientation clear by word 15 ("crawl space dweller," "shadowed library at dawn"); Accumulative lens holds through sensory density buildup to staff note's resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting constrains choice and charges closure: pipe chases supply the tape fragment, while "sapphire hush" evolves into "warmth... like light through stained glass" at climax. Dust on cheeks and boiler room nest reflect tactile urgency, though library's spatial choreography lacks one visceral detail (e.g., how ducts affect movement).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes ("invisibility was slow erosion of soul") tighten through protagonist agency: placing the tape fragment triggers tangible connection ("warmth spreading through her ribs"). Cost is unmistakable in her tear-streaked reaction to the staff note, narrowing options toward earned visibility without spectacle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete actions ("to cache was to honor. To remember was to resist erasure"), avoiding moralizing. Final line ("Visibility wasn’t spectacle. It was resonance") reweights the premise through the staff note’s echo of the tape’s message, charging closure without abstraction or Thematic Echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "sense memory flared—the scent of ozone," "ducts like veins." Focalization stays tightly controlled in third-limited; rhythm modulates from lyrical ("fractured sapphire hush") to sparse ("She knew what it was"). Slight register drift in "kindly methodical grace" feels abstract but quickly embodied.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("It fit in her palm like a broken promise" does triple duty). Rhythm varies naturally (short beats vs. flowing cadence). Only microscopic flaw: "ferromagnetic tape reel fragment" risks technicality but justified by context; no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "invisible person" trope through specific, lived details: caching relics as sacrament, tape’s "ghost-sound." Emotional truth in visibility-as-resonance avoids middle-ground hedging. Fresh inflection in the sapphire hush motif evolving from visual to emotional warmth at closure.</comment>
