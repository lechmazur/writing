<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "smiled not with triumph, but affectionate detachment" amid grief, though secondary pressure lacks without another character. Final choice to carry truth as "lightest burden" earns closure with felt cost through crystalline tears.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "fractured view now a lens of gratitude" reconfigures options with conceptual cost (tears hovering as "tiny lanterns"). Accumulative lens holds—each floor tightens emotional stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The icebound spire’s micro-setting constrains choice: frost-rimmed seams reveal cipher only at specific light angles, charging the final image where goggles filter "fractured beauty." Whale-skin diary and frostbloom sprig deepen tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation: "joy beneath anguish" evolves from abstract mission to embodied truth via vellum’s "quiet companion" revelation. Cost crystallizes when she absorbs "encrypted grief" as warmth seeping through wool—visible price paid in perspective shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "joy hides... within—folded in creases of every hard-won dawn" reweights frostbloom’s fragility as proof of persistence. No moralizing; resonance lives in the sprig tucked beside the diary at closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: servant notices "rivets and frost-rimmed seams," not grand vistas. Rhythmic control peaks when floor 9’s cipher "glows amber—each symbol a stepping stone," compressing tension without losing voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion but "lenses cracked like frozen rivers under moonlight" risks stacked metaphor. "Gleaming with stubborn dignity" slightly drifts into abstraction, though vellum’s "ghost-blue ink" redeems density with visceral texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms airship trope through intimate grief: goggles as cipher vessel reframes "encrypted diary" as coordinates of the soul. Frostbloom’s resilience avoids quirkiness by charging the closure’s tactile truth ("tucked beside a sprig").</comment>
