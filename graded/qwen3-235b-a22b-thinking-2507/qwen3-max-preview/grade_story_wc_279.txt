<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her socially perceptive gift shifting from interpretation to resonance, with embodied "lilac unease" blooming into recognition. Final choice to leave the mandala earned through tactile micro-choices like altering the swirl, though urban noise conflict lacks visceral escalation pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: tile cracking reconfigures "emergent hush" into "potential" with conceptual cost of spent echoes, crystallizing the before/after of her understanding. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds as whispers synchronize into presence, reweighting silence's meaning through density shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto setting constrains every choice—damp sand dictates mandala creation, mist thickens to mirror emotional shift. Final rain rivulets charging the closure image ("mandala in motion") proves environment charges the ending, satisfying the 9+ gate with tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (urban noise vs. meaningful silence) tightens through mandala's whisper synchronization, narrowing her options to acceptance. Cost is legible in the tile's fracture, but temporal pressure from "unlearning" timeframe lacks causal teeth, softening escalation impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: final line ("how, sometimes, they sing louder for it") reweights "meaning in the mess" without moralizing. The mandala’s dissolution charges the ending, proving thematic resonance through concrete action rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("read crowds like weather maps," "lilac unease") persists under pressure, with rhythmic control in fragmented whispers. Voice modulates perfectly from "clanging" city to grotto's "fractured sighs," no head-hopping despite single POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; "mist curled like breath" subtly echoes later "rising like a question mark" as purposeful pattern. One minor density issue: "soft, lavender-tinted discomfort" slightly overwrites the "lilac unease" motif in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms familiar "artist seeking meaning" trope through concrete grotto physics and whispering tile mechanics. The "emergent hush" concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking (mandala as interjection method) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
