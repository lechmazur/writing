<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elira’s linguistic focus drives choices with embodied contradiction (“not to heal, but to listen”), though Kael’s interiority remains thin despite pivotal role. Micro-choices like diary placement earn closure, but emotional layering lacks friction during high-stakes renegotiation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: Kael’s core harmonizes only after rejecting extraction, reweighting “rescue” via light-formed text. Accumulative lens holds through semantic density, with orientation anchored by line 3 and lens clarified by the hollow scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mountain setting constrains every choice—from gravity-stuttering aisles to vine-like books—and charges the final image (“shelves realigned”). Semantic blossoms in the diary prove micro-setting essential, though botanical details occasionally verge on ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elira’s agency: her gap-research method narrows options from extraction to renegotiation, with visible cost in Kael’s fractured core harmonizing only after conceptual surrender. Pressure tightens via linguistic strata, though Kael’s passivity slightly dilutes escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment><question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through “semantic blooms” and hollow absence, avoiding moralizing until the lexicon’s light-text delivers earned CR. Near-penalty for final-line thematic echo (“rescue is not removal”), but integration into closure image saves it from didacticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (“sensing linguistic strata,” “syntax that bent causality”) sustains voice under pressure. Dialogue carries subtext (“You’re not supposed to be here”), with rhythmic shifts during the hollow scene proving control. No head-hopping despite dual POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; “gravity seemed to stutter” exemplifies high-density propulsion. Slight register drift in “semantic blossoms” risks thematic echo but stays voice-coherent. Final line’s cadence (“turned a page”) charges closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synthesizes linguistics and time travel into non-obvious moral calculus (“rescue is reconciliation”). Risk-taking with Accumulative lens pays off via charged micro-setting, avoiding derivative tropes through semantic specificity like “verb root splitting into subjunctive branches.”</comment>
