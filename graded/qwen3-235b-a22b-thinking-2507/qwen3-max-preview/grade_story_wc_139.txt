<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority excels with concrete micro-choices (rearranging scalpels, timing footsteps) revealing contradictory impulses—thief/conscience—but the child’s internal conflict beyond the central premise lacks slight depth for 9.0. Motivation crystallizes perfectly through ink’s action on the contract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "mathematics of fair trade humming beneath their ribs" reconfigures stakes with undeniable conceptual cost under Accumulative lens. Orientation anchors by 50 words; no causality breaks in the ink’s transformative sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Funeral home prep room functions as micro-setting: stainless steel tray and refrigeration hum constrain choices (waiting actively), charging the final image where "deathly vitality" reweights fairness as practice. Sensory specificity avoids cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by child’s agency: ink dissolving the contract narrows options, then mortician’s arrival deepens stakes through vulnerability. Cost crystallizes in "half-empty" ink pot and emotional recalibration—"not healed, but recalibrated."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ink’s action, not moralizing. Final image ("architect of fairness") reweights "mathematics" as lived practice, avoiding binaries. No thematic echo; "con’s conscience" is character voice, not authorial sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("viscosity of human distraction") and rhythmic control under pressure: short sentences at "Midnight came" contrast lyrical closure. Mortician’s dialogue ("You’re the diplomat’s kid") carries subtext without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "paper trembled" shows not tells. Every line propels narrative: "geometric, fluid, humming with balance" compresses transformation. Final line’s "Of ink." resonates without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis: magical ink as tool for equity (not power), transforming "fair trade" from abstraction to practice. Risk-taking elevates stakes—"waiting actively" as revolutionary act—without gimmickry. Fresh through specific legalese dissolution.</comment>
