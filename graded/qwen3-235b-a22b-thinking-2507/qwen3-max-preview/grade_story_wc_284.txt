<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "defiance against the ache" vs surrender to legacy, but burns lack embodied specificity beyond "throbbed." Micro-choices like wind-shift calculation reveal values, though the "fix what's broken" motivation remains slightly abstract until the planting act crystallizes it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the empty pillbox sinking into the bluff’s bones reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost ("name no longer ash, but compost"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds from "brittle crust of winter" through the spiraling snow-as-pages image, with pressure tightening via snow’s decryption mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (pillbox, snowdrifts) constrains choices and charges the final image—microfilm pressed "beneath the lip of the hatch" where thaw carries it downward. Sensory hierarchy is perfect: her "gloved but trembling hands" fumbling with stiff fingers narrows perception to immediacies under stress.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs survival) tightens via the snow’s "layers of drift, each storm a cipher," forcing a trade-off: immediate safety for future reckoning. Cost is legible in "her name no longer ash, but compost," though the "prudently daring" trait lacks a visible mid-beat sacrifice beyond the planting act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the pillbox’s transformation (memory container → rusting relic) and the final compost metaphor, which reweights "justice" as patient cultivation. Avoids moralizing by making "quiet gardener of justice" an earned image, not a thesis—resonance lives in the spiraling snow as "scattered pages."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: "ice dared to weep," "birds tested unfamiliar songs" filters nature through her spy’s coded mindset. Rhythmic control under pressure shines in the staccato "calculating wind shifts, testing footholds," though "unused courage" slightly edges toward abstract label in the reflection beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "snow’s deepest fold, beneath the lip of the hatch" achieves high density with concrete propulsion. One borderline stock phrase ("defiance against the ache") but no figurative muddle—every image (e.g., "antenna crooked like a broken promise") serves closure’s compost metaphor without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms spy tropes via gardening metaphor: "planting seeds in frozen earth" synthesizes betrayal and hope with emotional specificity. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative lens over causal thriller) heightens stakes coherently, though "burned spy" premise leans familiar until the compost payoff reconfigures it.</comment>
