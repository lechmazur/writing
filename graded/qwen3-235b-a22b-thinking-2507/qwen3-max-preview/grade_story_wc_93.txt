<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (curse/gift) manifests in embodied micro-choices like breath-guided rock placement; final renunciation of control earns transformation through prior causality with visible cost in the soundless laugh.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: eels dissolving into light crystallizes the shift from curse to gift under Accumulative/Textural lens, with conceptual cost legible in "method to ask better questions" reframing the promise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Frictionless environment constrains every action (humming over speech, breath over grip) and charges the final image; tidal bluff's glassy surface mirrors the herder's internal shift toward alignment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the herder's agency: placing rocks becomes an act of surrender that forecloses control, with felt cost in the soundless laugh; escalation via density increase as aurora/eels converge into sacred syntax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "patterns hold what promises cannot" transforms from grandmother's riddle to lived method, avoiding moralizing via the final image of humming rocks charged with star dust.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (tactile over visual, "frictionless air" altering speech) persists under pressure; rhythmic control in "slippery stone, guided not by sight but by the curse" compresses tension without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density in "ribbons of emerald and violet pulsed across the sky, not as spectacle but as scripture" advances atmosphere and theme simultaneously; no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of frictionless physics as spiritual constraint transforms tropes; emotional truth in the herder's shift from "stole awe" to "harness wonder" feels earned through specific lived detail, not abstraction.</comment>
