<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "hollowing" ritual and flat narration masking void, but "morally ambiguous" lacks deep testing beyond stated label; micro-choices (burning pamphlets, sealing bouquet) reveal values under pressure without secondary character friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: the whispered "I miss you" during turbine stall crystallizes irreversible cost of performed compliance; Accumulative lens holds through density of whittling beats, each deepening the hush’s conceptual weight without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Wind turbines’ "remade hush" constrains choice (whispering only during maintenance pauses) and charges the final image, but farmhouse rattling windows could more actively alter tactics; micro-setting as pressure anchor is nearly flawless.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by protagonist agency: sealing bouquet in "Permitted" box narrows options to performative compliance, with cost legible in the whispered confession during true silence; dominant stake (grief vs mandated joy) tightens once via this decisive act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "hollowing absence into artifact" reweights grief’s cost without moralizing; final image of whittling "lighter, emptier" offers resonant answer to "cultivating lightness" with no stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("shavings curling like ghosts") and rhythmic control under pressure (flat narration modulating to whispered confession) showcase singular voice; no head-hopping, with psychic distance shifts serving the emotional void.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "Combustion is cooperation. Ash is amnesty" demonstrates high-density line work; only microscopic register drift on "morally ambiguous" (diagnostic label) prevents 10.0, but it’s diegetically justified.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms dystopian tropes via "remade hush" and grief-as-woodcarving; risk-taking (quiet climax during turbine stall) heightens stakes coherently, though emotional specificity edges out surface novelty for 9.1 vs higher.</comment>
