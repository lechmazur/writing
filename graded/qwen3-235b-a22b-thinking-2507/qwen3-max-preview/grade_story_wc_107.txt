<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (abandoning power while creating vessels) manifests in concrete micro-choices like flawed sphere-making; embodied emotion through "brittle to pliant" heart transformation with visible cost in departure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density intensifies via narration ritual until Earned Stasis closure where departure forecloses occupation with conceptual cost ("vessels that invited others to abandon fear").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Abandoned control room actively constrains choices (salvaged glass positioning, rusted chair); melting ice functions as live clock tightening tactics, charging final image with "drip-drip-drip" cadence shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (crafting inquiry zones vs frozen assumptions) deepens through protagonist's agency: sphere-making ritual narrows options to symbolic abandonment, with cost crystallized in "brittle to pliant" heart transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: flawed spheres reweight "thawing heart" concept at closure where child's "weightless gravity of a question" offers non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature (glass-focused noticing: "molten silica glow," "rainbows on rusted dials") creates rhythmic control; "thoughtfully spirited" narration modulates pressure through dramatic self-dialogue without voice slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; high density ("drip-drip-drip echoed like metronome") propels momentum. Minor figurative muddle in "half-remembered promises" (metaphor strain) barely touches early peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms familiar "thaw" trope through glassblower's specific craft logic; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes via "imperfect spheres for silence" without obscuring Charged Poise closure.</comment>
