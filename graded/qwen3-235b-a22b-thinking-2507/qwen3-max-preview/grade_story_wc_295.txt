<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when chronicler shifts from passive witness to active burden-sharer; embodied grief ("ink-stained fingers tracing constellations that pulsed like living veins") avoids therapy-speak. Final choice earned through Zeta Cygni realization with cost: eternal cyclical responsibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "Tomorrow, another message. Another burden. Another song" crystallizes irreversible commitment with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds—density peaks when glyphs redefined as "receipts," pressure narrowing options to redistribution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting (star charts) constrains choices—Zeta Cygni’s dimming pattern aligns with glyphs to trigger action. Recurring daylily charges final image: fresh bloom pressed into journal signifies endless renewal of burden-bearing duty.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (record vs. redistribute burdens) tightens when telegram arrives; chronicler’s agency drives escalation—redefining glyphs as "receipts" forces trade-off: hoard burdens or "weave them into stories." Cost legible in dawn commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: burdens as "meteor showers of mercy," not abstract grief. Ending offers resonant answer—song redistributing weight—without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; "grief, when shared, turned to grace" feels earned, not stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "variable stars blinked their cryptic morse—not random flickers, but rhythmic sighs of cosmic exhaustion." Rhythmic control peaks in dream sequence—"words shaped from starlight and sorrow, syllables that shimmered like dew on petals at midnight."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cryptic morse—not random flickers" exemplifies layered syntax. Figurative language ("stars spoke in burdens, not light") remains coherent under pressure. Final line’s cadence shift ("Tomorrow, another...") propels closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms cosmic grief trope through specific mechanics: burdens as measurable stellar dimming. Risk-taking heightens stakes—temple inscriptions as "receipts" reframes spirituality as active redistribution. Emotional specificity avoids sentimentality.</comment>
