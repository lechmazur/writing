<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in porcelain shard ritual (fragility as strength), but heartbeat counting lacks integration into choices; final endurance earned though closure cost feels conceptual rather than embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("ghosts stilled. Not erased. But… arranged") crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost ("hollow in the world"), though escalation lacks tangible opposition beyond atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Snowdrifts and opal glass create vivid texture, but setting never actively constrains choices; micro-setting (porcelain shard) charges final image yet misses 9+ gate by failing to alter tactics during the beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieving wisdom from system failure) signals early, but conflict lacks teeth—ghosts plead rather than resist, and escalation relies solely on ink bloom’s deepening without narrowing options or raising visceral stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ink’s "cartography of lost data" and shard ritual, avoiding moralizing; final image ("not saved, but settled") reweights "wisdom from failure" with conceptual cost, no thematic echo in closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("frost feathered the glass like breath on a mirror") and rhythmic control under pressure flawless; heartbeat repetition slightly dilutes urgency but elision taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose near-flawless except heartbeat paraphrase loop ("counting heartbeats—seventeen thousand..." then "heartbeats counted silently"); no closure artifacts but disallows 9+ due to mid-story scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Digital ghosts as corrupted data transforms tropes, but death certificate error feels derivative; shard ritual and ink defrag method synthesize into fresh emotional logic that avoids safety-hedging.</comment>
