<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in micro-choices: pressing crystal to mirrors (not for magic but resonance) while seeking strangers' suspended moments, culminating in her own reflection revealing the library-hiding girl. Embodied emotion ("breath fogged the mirrors, then cleared") avoids diagnostic labels under peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "What if we choose differently?" crystallizes the accumulative lens with undeniable conceptual cost ("It wasn’t whole. It never would be. But it was enough"). Orientation anchors by line 4 (who/where/when), and the lighthouse beam’s sweep maintains causal pressure through the ice shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The lighthouse beam and vintage mirrors function as micro-setting that charges the final image—mirrors "holding fragments of courage" reconfigure the opening’s "ancient beasts" into "hidden channels." Coastal salt-clouded glass literally constrains her action (pressing crystal to fogged surfaces), making environment indispensable to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten accumulatively: each mirror glimpse (child’s tear, soldier’s lip tremble) narrows options toward the whispered question. The cost is visceral in the crystal’s permanent fracture ("never would be whole"), yet its "humming with quiet light" reweights the stakes as ongoing courage, not final victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the soldier’s "trembling lip" moment—showing empathy’s cost without moralizing. The final image (mirrors "waiting to be seen") answers "how to sustain peace" by reweighting the crystal’s purpose as a "lens for seeing humanity," avoiding thematic echo through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: notices "gilt frames tarnished" and "coastal salt" on glass, filtering details through her mission. Rhythm modulates under pressure ("Not to fix it. Not to erase the cracks.") with zero head-hopping; interiority stays within her plausible lexicon ("salvaged," "reconstitute").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; every line propels meaning. "Ice floes groaned below like ancient beasts" serves dual purpose (setting/atmosphere + thematic weight). Final line ("stretch like invitations") recharges "shadow-laced" opening with crystalline clarity—zero figurative muddle in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms peacekeeping tropes via "courageous anomaly" concept grounded in the soldier’s lip tremble. Risk-taking (accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry—the library-hiding girl reveal feels inevitable, not contrived, through specific lived detail.</comment>
