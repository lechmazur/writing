<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via embodied tidal rhythm ("skin pulsed with inner cadence") and micro-choices like pressing moonstone to collarbone to trigger memory surge. Villagers' sudden reverence lacks causal groundwork, weakening the final choice's earned quality despite strong solitary motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "she had rewritten it" crystallizes stakes with visible cost (bleeding feet, fused moonstone). Villagers' shift from threat to acceptance lacks on-page motivation escalation, slightly muddying the stance crystallization under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Twilight garden actively constrains choices—dawn's approach forces dance completion, moss receives outlawed "pigment" from bleeding feet. Final image of her curled "like a question mark" under stars charges the setting’s role in memory’s rebirth, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memory preservation vs. erasure) tightens through physical cost: dancing until feet bleed transforms "to escape" into "to inscribe." External threat (the ban) remains abstract, weakening escalation despite visceral personal sacrifice anchoring the stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "negative space in leaf shadows" teaching how "absence births meaning" directly fuels her cosmic verse. Final line "rewritten it" offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, though "obsidian grace" slightly tips into thematic abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV stays rigorously sensory ("sweat traced silver rivers down her ribs"), with rhythm mirroring tidal motion. "Cosmic sighs" risks abstraction but is justified by her artistic lens; no head-hopping or register drift even under peak stress of the dance sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose flows with zero loops, but "obsidian grace in every line of her face" introduces abstract thematic language where embodied detail reigns elsewhere. Minor overwriting in "gravitational sighs and stellar sighs" slightly dilutes momentum without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms dystopian tropes via dance-as-inscription ("carved arcs... each gesture a glyph") and moonstone as memory vessel. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes coherently, though villagers' motivation shift lacks fresh inflection.</comment>
