<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prophet's motivation ("turn obstacles into instruments") is embodied through actions like kneeling at obsidian sea, but Kael's wide-eyed reaction lacks interior contradiction; final choice earned yet apprentice's thin characterization limits depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orientation succeeds instantly with "blue hour" and "orchard afloat"; closure achieves Earned Stasis as harmonic rain dissolves clouds while sea's transformation (obsidian to translucent) legibly charges cost, though sea-darkening obstacle lacks sufficient foreshadowing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orchard afloat constrains every choice: roots drinking salt enable humming, gnarled trees supply resonating fruit for seed-drums that directly alter climax tactics, making environment indispensable to closure's cobalt rings charging wave-xylophone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stake (transforming sonic obstacles) tightens meaningfully when sea thickens; Prophet's kneeling/humming shows agency under Accumulative lens, with exhaustion and Kael's overwhelmed state charging the final image, though obstacle's emergence feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions—dubbing emotional timbre, resonating fruit—not abstraction; harmonic rain finale reweights "restless euphony" into earned stillness without moralizing, though "dread laced with curiosity" borders on over-articulation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("sky bled indigo into sea’s mirrored skin"); rhythm accelerates during "Kael scrambled to dub" under pressure; consistent poetic diction avoids stock phrases, though "dread laced with curiosity" slightly overwrites emotion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cobalt rings" and "golden helix" deliver crystalline imagery without muddle; every sentence advances multiple elements (e.g., "seeds ejecting in rhythmic bursts" conveys action, sound, and consequence simultaneously).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "prophet" trope through sonic physics—conch-shell ledger and cetacean ribcages feel inevitable; climax's harmonic rain reconfigures stakes with emotional truth, though driftwood orchard echoes existing eco-fantasy without sufficient novelty.</comment>
