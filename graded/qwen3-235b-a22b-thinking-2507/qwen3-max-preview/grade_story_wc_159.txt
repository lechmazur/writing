<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in resisting restoration temptation ("no restoration... only preservation"), embodied through chime-handling micro-choices. Motivation rooted in generational covenant ("grandmother whispered"), but Veyra’s naming lacks visceral internal friction during the pivotal act.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds perfectly: density of "foxglove regret" auroras deepens the preservation stake with felt cost ("light didn’t last. It never did"). Closure as Earned Stasis crystallizes in her "quiet satisfaction of a vow kept"—irreversible commitment to transience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Opal library’s petrified emotions ("grief bound in vellum") constrain choices—light illuminates absences, not objects. Final image of chime "nestled against her chest like a sleeping bird" charges closure by reweighting the cracked tube as living legacy, not relic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when recalling failed caretakers who "shattered their chimes," narrowing her agency to nuanced resonance over force. Cost is legible in Veyra’s fleeting aurora ("for a breath, the nook remembered itself")—preservation’s inherent transience made visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "foxglove regret"-hued light illuminating absences, not morals. Final image rejects resurrection ("no restoration") by showing preservation as tending emptiness—"vacant reading nook" remembering itself without false hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature dominates: "listening, by letting memory glow where silence pooled darkest." Rhythmic control shifts from crystalline grace to taut restraint during naming ("mouthing syllables of vanished ones"), with zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; "spectral and foxglove regret-hued" risks overwriting but pays off in closure’s "lavender radiance." One deduction: "soft violet glow pulsed... deeper indigo shimmered" has slight synonym churn in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "museum of feelings" trope via tactile cataloging ("joy pressed between glass"). Bold risk: preservation as tending emptiness, not revival. Fresh inflection in "crack wasn’t damage, but an opening—a mouth for ghosts."</comment>
