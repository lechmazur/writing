<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority masterfully embodied: "silence that tastes of ozone" shows sensory contradiction under pressure. Final renunciation (laying down rag knot) earns cost through prior causality, though motivation emerges slightly late at 35% word count.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the star's reappearance crystallizes defiance with conceptual cost ("spark takes root—in soul"). Late backstory insertion (35%) risks orientation debt but payoff justifies it; causality holds under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting (kerosene rag knot) charges closure: dissolving into mosaic reweights the final image. "Phosphorescent dust halos" constrain movement while "teeth-ringing harmonics" make setting physically felt, passing 9+ gate via object-as-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency: Lira's dance physically manifests "defying gravity" with escalating cost (rag knot's warmth → dissolution). Dominant stake emerges late (35%), slightly weakening early pressure buildup despite strong climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "choreograph light in dark" crystallizes as the star-revealing chord. Final image reweights "hopelessness" without moralizing, though backstory's "ambition to ash" risks thematic echo in peak beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "filtering tremors" shows character-specific attention. Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure ("boots striking tiles like mallets"), with zero head-hopping despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor physics artifact: "syllables bending into frequencies that vibrate the rag knot" strains plausibility in climax beat. Otherwise flawless density—phosphorescent halos and ozone-tasting silence compress multiple functions without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specificity: "vines that recoil from moonlight" and "stamen-lanterns" ground fireworks-as-prayer in tangible biology. Risk distinction +0.3 for making hope's cost physical (dissolving rag knot) not abstract.</comment>
