<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "surprised not by danger but by beauty" while scanning for threats; micro-choice to activate chip despite pilgrim's warning reveals hierarchy of values. Pilgrim's silent presence slightly underutilized as pressure source but closure renunciation feels earned through embodied cost ("tears tracing dust").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "simply present" crystallizes stakes with undeniable cost in "fragments of self she'd shed." Accumulative lens holds through sensory density buildup to harmonic vibration. Minor choreography strain with pilgrim's late appearance doesn't undermine cost legibility at "stopped searching and started listening."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Observatory actively constrains choices: "dust" grounds her movements, "twilight" enables "brilliant dimness" atmosphere charging the final image. Micro-setting triumph—the obsidian case matters when she tucks chip away as talisman. Every sensory detail reflects her thermal-scan-trained urgency without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("decode frequency of belonging") tightens through deepening as chip shifts from external signal to internal tuning. Protagonist agency drives all escalation: prying stone seam, aligning stars. Cost is unmistakable—"fragments of self she'd shed" alters her final stance. Pilgrim's warning creates secondary pressure without resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: "belonging wasn't a signal... it was the resonance" reweights premise without moralizing. Final image ("simply present") offers non-literal answer to central question. Avoids sentimentality by grounding epiphany in physical details (dust, heartbeat sync). Pilgrim's dialogue stays concrete, dodging thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless: "eyes trained to spot micron-deviations" colors all description. Voice modulates from technical ("micro-pry") to lyrical during epiphany without register drift. Zero filter verbs; drone's "narrow beam" shows rather than tells tension. Pilgrim's sparse dialogue distinct in rhythm yet consistent with mystic role.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold—sentences vary from clipped ("She knelt.") to flowing ("visions flickered..."). Peak beat ("heartbeat sync") avoids purple prose while packing emotional density. Final line recharges "missing pieces" motif perfectly. Every modifier earns its place: "paradoxical glow of twilight" crystallizes atmosphere without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tech/spirituality: "frequency of belonging" made concrete through drone mechanics. Emotional specificity in "off-key lullabies" avoids generic self-discovery tropes. Risk-taking (lyric tech-noir) heightens stakes—observatory's "stone remembers" deepens theme without gimmickry. Transformation test passed: remove drone, premise collapses.</comment>
