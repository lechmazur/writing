<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira’s pacifism and shadow work manifest through embodied micro-choices (apologizing to darkness, tear-triggered gravity shifts), avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Weakness: ship’s sentience lacks secondary pressure despite atmospheric dimming; motivation for reunion remains profound but under-pressured by external stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds impeccably: emotional density escalates via stitching ritual and tear-calibration toward Charged Poise closure. Cost is undeniable ("Kwan Yin’s Tear dissolved into mist"), though the final photograph’s discovery slightly edges toward convenience despite earned searching.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Kwan Yin’s Tear functions as micro-setting, constraining choices through emotional gravity (sinking/lightening) and charging the final image via dissolution. Spaceship’s failing systems actively pressure tactics (gravity plates, coolant valve photo), fulfilling 9+ gate despite minor underuse of Earth relics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate purely through protagonist agency: each stitch tightens emotional calibration pressure ("Too heavy, gate shatters") with visceral cost (Tear’s dissolution). Weakness: ship’s sentience doesn’t compound stakes beyond atmospheric response, but single-stake focus fits length impeccably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—stitching as healing, shadow as "anchor/wing"—with no moralizing. Final image (mother’s cake tear) reweights prior struggle non-literally. Near-miss: "impossibility was just a wound" risks thematic echo but stays character-bound.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice radiates Elira’s perceptual signature ("hair floating like kelp," tear-refracted light) with rhythmic precision under pressure. Zero head-hopping; compression ("stitched—not fabric, not wounds...") serves ritual intensity. Minor overwriting ("needle-fine intent") forgiven by voice cohesion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; sentences vary rhythm to mirror emotional shifts ("She felt herself lighten, toes lifting..."). "Tears welling—not from sorrow, but release" avoids cliché. Closure beat immaculate; "needle-fine intent" borderline purple but justified by focus.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: pacifist using emotional gravity to stitch dimensions avoids tropes. Transformation test passed—core arc fails if names/places swap. Risk-taking (quiet climax, shadow as mirror-self) heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
