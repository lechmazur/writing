<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority richly concrete ("bones aching for a time she could not return to"), micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values (placing shell, conducting memories). Lacks contradictory impulses in peak beats; motivation clear but not tested against competing needs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is masterful Charged Poise: horizon splitting reveals "another possibility" then candle snuffs, shell grows still—cost of unsustainable magic is visceral. Orientation flawless; Accumulative lens held through sensory density buildup to harmonic ice fissures.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass spire actively constrains choice (resonates with music, absorbs fortunes) and charges final image (vibrating then still). Frozen lake's harmonic cracks prove environmental consequence. Slight deduction: cold's tactical impact underexplored despite setting prominence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through Accumulative escalation: kitchen scene swelling to timpani crash, rain becoming snares, culminating in harmonic ice fissures. "Before exhaustion hits" rule creates felt cost; pressure narrows options via sensory density without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "conductor of unheard symphonies" reframed as endurance in final line ("remembered how to try"). No moralizing; horizon splitting offers non-literal answer to memory-as-score with conceptual cost. Avoids sentimentality through physical effort.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("frost feathered the glass floor in fractal lace"); rhythm modulates with pressure (short sentences during crescendo). "Chronologically homesick" slightly academic but redeemed by embodied context. Zero head-hopping; voice remains character-particular under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line craft near-flawless: "upturned hush" compresses tension, cadence accelerates with conducting. Minor paraphrase loop on nautilus/memory ("fractured yet perfect... like memory itself" → "logarithmic spiral mirrored memory deepens"). No closure-impacting artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "memory keeper" trope via conductor/symphony synthesis. Fortune cookie writer angle fresh; emotional specificity in "remembered how to try" avoids cliché. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. One fresh inflection: ice cracking from song.</comment>
