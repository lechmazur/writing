<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "calm wasn't passive; it was perceptively calm" and "why run when you can reroute?" Micro-choices like chalk arrows reveal value hierarchy. Final renunciation of restarting CirqueLogix feels earned through prior solitude rituals, though secondary characters remain atmospheric pressure only.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "he’s learned to dance in the loop" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (abandoning linear success). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through markers and decay metaphors. Wind direction realization reweights the premise without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Abandoned circus train constrains every choice: chalk arrows on boxcars, stones on tracks, and the train’s "dusky harmony" charge the final image. Sensory details ("raccoons in sequined costumes," "metallic lullaby") filter through the son’s tactile, lived-in navigation of decay, avoiding static symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escaping legacy through linear progress) tightens via startup collapse into a deepening about circular meaning. The son’s agency in laying territorial markers narrows options, with visible cost: "watching CirqueLogix collapse not with rage, but... physics." Pressure accumulates toward the wind-direction realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "paths circle back because they’re loops of learning" becomes embodied in the train’s physical loops and territorial markers. Final image reweights the central question without moralizing, though "why do some paths circle back?" risks slight thematic echo near closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: "fingers sifting through... ghost of some distant heist" shows selective attention. Rhythm modulates from meditative ("creak of metal, sigh of wind") to urgent ("algorithms glitching, clients fleeing"). No head-hopping; voice stays anchored in the son’s lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "polished calm" reappears with charged specificity. "Bulgarian Lev note he’d left on a seat" demonstrates textural density. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" (implied in reflection) avoids penalty as it’s concretely anchored to the train’s decay.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "failure retreat" trope through the territorial markers' dual function (dissuasion/self-recalibration). Emotional truth in "watching a trapeze artist miss the bar—not failure, but physics" avoids cliché. Risk-taking (lyric structure, sparse dialogue) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
