<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concretely embodied ("fingers tracing rusted railing," "breath ragged with bleak exhilaration") and motivation rooted in rebellion against fate’s arithmetic. Final choice to take the gear earns endurance with visible cost (lighthouse crumbling), though contradictory impulses could deepen under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost: "lighthouse groaned... hunger stone dissolved" reconfigures fate’s grip while the tide’s retreat crystallizes irreversible stakes. Causal lens holds flawlessly from inciting yoyo reverse-engineering to gear insertion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hunger stone and lighthouse function as micro-setting constraints—stone’s geometry dictates action, tide timing creates live pressure ("tide holding its breath"). Final gull’s return charges the opening’s salt spray, meeting 9+ gate through tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>One tightening forecloses fate’s path: gear insertion snaps "threads of consequence" with immediate cost (lighthouse fissuring). Stakes escalate through protagonist agency alone—no coincidence resolves conflict—making the price ("carry its weight alone") unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action ("not redemption. this was rebellion") and final image ("tomorrow’s clocks would tick backward") reweights fate without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by having the gear’s paradox embody salvation, not abstract philosophy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in character-specific noticing ("latent radiance bloomed—not light, but presence"). Rhythmic control under pressure ("The ground trembled. The lighthouse beam...") avoids head-hopping while compressing time via lyric precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere or causality ("salt spray gnawed at his coat" shows erosion). Final line ("first gull dared return") recharges opening imagery with perfect propulsion—no figurative muddle even in high-stakes beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms time-reversal trope through specific mechanics (yoyo’s lunar gyroscope) and emotional truth ("bleak exhilaration"). Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry; the hunger stone’s famine ledger grounds universality in verifiable detail.</comment>
