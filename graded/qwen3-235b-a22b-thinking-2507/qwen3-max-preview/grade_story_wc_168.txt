<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "Yes. I'm afraid. And that’s why I stay"—embodied fear versus duty. Micro-choices like pressing the box to his sternum reveal hierarchy of values. No therapy-speak; grief manifests as "fault lines" in scars, not labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: leaving "I remember. I’m still here. You’re not alone" reconfigures innocence as "honored," not restored. Cost legible in "box lighter now, as if fractures let burden breathe." Accumulative lens holds with density increase through letter readings.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Cracked porcelain box functions as micro-setting: constrains choices (unlatching with "gently skilled precision") and charges closure when left lighter. Frost-dusted pine needles and moss-cushioned boulder filter urgency through firefighter’s tactile familiarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through letter questions forcing stance crystallization: "Why did fire take my dog?" becomes "Fire doesn’t hate. It just is." Cost escalates via his micro-choices—whispering replies that foreclose easy comfort, trading resolution for "resonance."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through charged particulars: "bargained innocence—not lost, not restored, but honored" reweights premise without moralizing. Final image of "translation no fire could consume" offers resonant answer to "Are you afraid too?" through action, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature dominates: "ember-kisses" on hands, "frost-dusted pine needles" reflecting professional attention. Rhythm modulates under pressure—short phrases ("He didn’t need resolution. He needed resonance.") amid lyrical stretches. Zero head-hopping; voice stays firefighter-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "small defiance, a soft rebellion" uses purposeful repetition. Final line’s cadence ("a translation no fire could consume") avoids overwriting while charging closure. Minor density in "hold space for truth until softened enough" is voice-justified.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms firefighter trope via porcelain box as "reliquary for small, trembling truths." Emotional specificity in children’s questions ("Will trees grow back?") avoids generic trauma. Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off through "hard softness" synthesis—no safety hedging.</comment>
