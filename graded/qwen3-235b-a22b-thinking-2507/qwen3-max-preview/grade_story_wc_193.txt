<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "virtuously mischievous" choice to act from spite, not faith. Embodied emotion in channeling "slammed doors" into the bolt crystallizes the earned endurance. Slight under-demonstration of cunning before climax holds score below 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "Diamonds aren't worn. They're remembered" reweights trauma with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors within 40 words; Accumulative lens holds through pressure-to-crystal transformation. Cost proof: "channeled every slammed door" into the seam's existential weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mushroom farm as micro-setting constrains choice—glowing caps flare during pressure channeling, later "singing" to bolt's hum. Bolt's tactile evolution (cold to "heartbeat"-warm) charges the final harvest. "Shadowseam wonder" slightly over-explained but redeemed by visceral "liquid potential" description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (transforming trauma) tightens through accumulative pressure: existential weight mounts until "she didn't resist." Agency clear in channeling betrayal into the bolt; cost is the visceral "weight of her naivety" made tangible. Coincidence (texts) complicates but resolution stems from her choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment>Theme emerges through bolt's alchemy—"diamonds are remembered"—avoiding moralizing. Final image (crystal-veined mushrooms) resonates non-literally with "pressure translates." No thematic echo; cost is embedded in "wounds transformed" lattice. Wisdom earned via concrete channeling of "IOUs whispered in boardrooms."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature: notices "ozone and old libraries" smelling liquid, "cerulean halos." Rhythm shifts from lyrical ("lantern breathing") to staccato ("It hissed. The pressure mounted") under stress. "Virtuously mischievous" slightly explanatory but redeemed by final glitchy text. Zero head-hopping; voice modulates perfectly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "shadows stitched themselves into seams" shows textural specificity. Propulsion through concrete verbs ("coaxed mycelium," "pressed the bolt"). Minor register drift in "virtuously mischievous by nature" description, but no closure impact. Final line's "tend it" crystallizes rhythm with thematic weight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms quantum tropes via Cold War bolt and medicinal mushrooms—specificity prevents abstraction. Emotional truth in "hollowed-out trust" avoiding trauma clichés. Risk-taking (glitchy texts as pressure conduit) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh synthesis: pyramid scheme ruins fueling literal alchemy.</comment>
