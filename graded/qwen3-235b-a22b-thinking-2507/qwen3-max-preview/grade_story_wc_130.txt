<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "not to repair, but to understand" and saltwater-refracted projections; embodied grief via ink-stained fingers tracing fractures avoids therapy-speak. Flaw: micro-choice of leaving hazel eye lacks visible cost escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly—"orchard’s glow strengthened" reconfigures silence into resonance with conceptual cost of shared language loss. Orientation clear by line 3; Accumulative lens holds through density shifts to final hum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Cavern orchard’s bioluminescent fruit directly constrains choices (dimming with Aris’ absence) and charges final image. Glass eyes function as micro-setting when refracting tears into coordinates—environment shapes every tactic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (comprehension of ambiguous loss) tightens via lunar projection mechanics; cost crystallizes when tears alter equations. Agency-driven escalation peaks with "silence wasn’t emptiness. It was resonance" reweighting options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—leaving hazel eye as "anchor, beacon" avoids moralizing. Final fruit-cradling image answers "buried optimism" question non-literally via "patterns persist" without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "dovetailing equations into lullabies" blends analytical/lyrical diction. Rhythmic control under pressure in fragments like "Not death, not theft, not fire—" modulates emotional intensity flawlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; "metronomes counting down to nothing" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor deduction: "gently inventive as ever" slightly tells rather than shows trait in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms twin-loss trope via mathematical lens—glass eyes as calibration tools feel inevitable. Emotional specificity in "loss of shared language" avoids generic grief templates while charging closure.</comment>
