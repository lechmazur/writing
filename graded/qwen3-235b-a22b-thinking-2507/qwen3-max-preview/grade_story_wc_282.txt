<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via embodied choices ("not for comfort, but calibration") and micro-turns under pressure, though the shift from observer to participant lacks deeper internal friction despite clear motivation. Final renunciation of solitude feels earned through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "purpose no longer solitary" crystallizes cost through action, not exposition. Orientation anchors by word 30, and Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density peak at leaf dissolution. Cost proof is undeniable in residual warmth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cave network functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choices (tidal rhythms, lichen reactions), charging the climax with emerald spirals and dissolving leaf. Salt on knees and bioluminescent feedback make environment indispensable to final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when fossil floats, narrowing options from recording to participation. Cost ("purpose no longer solitary") is visible and legible, though escalation slightly rushed. Agency-driven under Accumulative lens with thermal dialogue raising conceptual stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "transitional objects" becoming conduits; final image of motes carrying feeling reweights the premise without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—no character states the thesis, yet "Who remembers us?" resonates as earned subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("thermal ghosts of longing," "cellular memory humming") with rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift in "existential" slightly jars, but compression remains purposeful and taught from opening.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Near-flawless density and propulsion: "brittle and veined like a forgotten nerve ending" does triple duty. Zero loops or scaffold; final line "skin still humming" avoids closure muddle. One hairline slip: "existential" feels slightly out-of-POV lexicon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specific logic: "factually mystical" fossil enables thermographic dialogue, and cave’s bioluminescence pressures choices. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry—emotional translation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
