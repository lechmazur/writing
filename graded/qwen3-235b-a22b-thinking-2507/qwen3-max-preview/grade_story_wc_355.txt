<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority crystallizes through sensory synesthesia ("painted vibrations as hues") rather than labels; final endurance (kneeling amid fireworks) earns cost via prior causal chain of recovered silences. Only flaw: pacifism lacks active testing under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost ("tears glistening not from triumph, but from reverence") under Accumulative lens; density escalation via layered frequencies ("child's held breath... wind through wheat") reweights silence's fragility as fireworks detonate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Workshop's petrified silence jars and meteorite clasp constrain choices (frequency tuning); final image of "screaming stars" vs. "symphony within" charges closure. Micro-setting mastery elevates to 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake tightening through frequency layers narrows options to a single decisive choice; cost legible in "reverence" amid chaos. Minor deduction: pressure lacks visible tactical shift during escalation beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (recovered silence vials) not moralizing; final image ("kneeling in the dark... unlock silences") offers non-literal answer to empathy's path. Avoids final-paragraph thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in synesthetic descriptions ("whispered geometries"); rhythmic control during frequency layering maintains voice under pressure. Zero head-hopping despite reflective fragments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "velvet cobwebs" risks ornamental but earns weight via closure's "screaming stars" contrast. Deducted 0.1 for "sincerity was her only script" slightly flattening momentum in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "recovery" trope through sonic archaeology of silence; emotional truth in "silence of a hand almost reached out" feels freshly specific. Risk-taking (silence as cataloged dialect) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
