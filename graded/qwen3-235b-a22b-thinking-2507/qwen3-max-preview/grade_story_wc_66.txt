<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; tears as catalyst feels received, not earned through prior struggle. Final choice shows endurance but no visible internal conflict during pivotal transcription moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation test fails: no "who/where/when" anchor by 120 words (atmosphere precedes character). Charged Poise closure lands with conceptual cost (tears as activation code), but early disorientation isn't functional for closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ember alcove constrains choices (midnight tuning only when embers sigh to charcoal) and charges final image (embers flare as tears fall). Micro-setting actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>No meaningful escalation: pirate broadcasts merely deliver revelations. Stakes remain atmospheric; no narrowing of options or visible price altering tactics despite dial burning thumb.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Final line ("somewhere, another alcove would warm") offers resonant non-literal answer to "can stories revive?" Avoids moralizing but conceptual repricing lacks sufficient complexity in dust-revival mechanics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mist curling like a sigh," "dust motes swirling into miniature theaters") with rhythmic control under pressure. Zero head-hopping; voice modulates perfectly from tension to calm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; high density with clear propulsion ("Static hissed, then a voice"). "Watercolor ghosts of staves" shows fresh metaphor without muddle. Final "thistled calm" slightly tonally jarring but redeemed by context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms radio trope through specific mechanics (lyrics dissolving unless written, tears as activation code). Risk-taking (dust-theaters as resurrection) heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional specificity avoids template.</comment>
