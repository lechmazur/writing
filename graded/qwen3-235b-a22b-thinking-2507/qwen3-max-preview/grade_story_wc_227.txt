<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "hands shook not from fear but weight of kintsugi intentions," with embodied micro-choices like lacquer-from-tears revealing hierarchy of values. "Version of me I abandoned" borders on therapy-speak, slightly undermining peak-beat authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("workshop no longer felt like a raft... altar") lands with visceral cost: the purified breath reconfigures oblivion into sacred space under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors by word 15 with iron floor trembling on acid sea.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gears-and-cogs workshop constrains every choice—the acid sea’s hiss dictates urgency, while the key ring charm evolves from cold heirloom to warm catalyst. Final image’s purified air proves environment charges closure through tangible consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten relentlessly via protagonist agency: "running out of air" forces temporal pressure, narrowing options to final tear-lacquer application. Cost is unmistakable in the workshop’s near-collapse and the alchemist’s literal breathlessness during revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—kintsugi as "gilding fractures" not hiding them—avoiding moralizing. Final breath ("not held, not stolen, but given") resonates as non-literal answer to "conjure meaning," though "stitches chaos into coherence" risks abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: "acid sea that hissed like chorus of dying serpents" filters through alchemist’s trauma. Rhythmic control peaks in "This one—for the child I couldn’t save," compressing grief without losing specificity under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats, but "lacquer seep from her fingertip" (tense error) and filter verb "felt the memories rise" dull immediacy. High density sustained, though "golden aura that pushed back the fumes" slightly overwrites the earned image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synthesis of kintsugi philosophy with acid-sea alchemy feels inevitable, transforming cliché into fresh emotional calculus. Risk-taking elevates stakes—statue’s "eyes flickered open—not with life, but recognition"—without gimmickry.</comment>
