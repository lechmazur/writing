<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (stoicism vs. sensitivity) drives action; "cradled the doll" and silent weeping embody emotion without labels. Final renunciation (becoming scribe/priestess) is earned by inkwell depletion and letter discovery. Near-flawless, but flaw compounding is subtle—her competence borders on idealized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost: "inkwell empty, she felt lighter—not hollow, but clarified." Orientation clear by line 3; accumulative lens holds as notes/entropy density intensifies toward letter discovery. Minor deduction: conceptual cost slightly abstract vs. tangible loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Submerged pavilion constrains every choice (water at knees, shifting tiles); inkwell’s depletion charges the final image ("refilled from river, rain, tears"). Micro-setting (doll, copper tube) directly alters tactics. 9+ gate passed: tool charges closure decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes (memory vs. entropy) tighten via inkwell thinning and pavilion’s groaning beams, culminating in the letter discovery. Agency drives escalation: copying the letter with last ink is a trade-off foreclosing neutrality. Cost felt in emotional yield ("stoicism yielding to sensitivity"). Slight deduction for low-stakes pressure in short form.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ritual: "witnessed absence" reweights loss as active preservation. Final image (refilling inkwell) answers "how to honor erasure" without moralizing. Avoids anti-patterns—no thematic echo, ambiguity lingers via "townsfolk whispered." Exceptional resonance through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "silt swirling like ghosts" filters decay through surveyor’s precision. Voice modulates under pressure—lyrical during letter discovery ("bride who never arrived"). Minor deduction for "cedar and old correspondence" (slight overwriting in high-pressure beat).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("barnacle-crowns dangling above silent waltzes" does triple duty). Final line’s rhythm ("river, from rain, from tears") propels closure. Deduction: "sepia ink that smelled of cedar" borders on ornamental in otherwise lean prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "archeologist of abandoned dreams" transforms elegy into tactile ritual. Emotional specificity ("You were loved. You are remembered") avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (quiet closure) heightens stakes—removing any detail breaks the premise’s integrity.</comment>
