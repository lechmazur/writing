<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her tactile sensitivity versus the burden of witnessing; "listened—not with ears, but with the hollow behind her ribs" embodies emotion without labels. Final choice to leave the sketch earns renunciation through prior causality of salvaging fragments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "her heart heavier, her purpose clearer" crystallizes legacy’s weight. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds as sensory density peaks with moonlight on the film negative, reconfiguring stakes through the final whisper into stone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Ivy functions as active micro-setting: "tendrils threading through cracks like veins" pressures her discovery, then "exhaling" charges the closure image. The film negative’s serpent-like curl constrains her final choice to not capture the glow, directly shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation ("sigh/sob/silence" to diaries’ grief), but escalation lacks narrowing options; pressure intensifies via sensory density rather than protagonist-driven choices. Cost is felt in her "heavier heart," though external constraints remain gentle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Final image "the walls dreamed. And now, so would she" resonantly answers "what walls dream about" without moralizing. Legacy’s burden reweights through concrete action—leaving the sketch—avoiding abstraction while embracing complexity of collective mourning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in "hollow behind her ribs" listening and "cradling a wound" description. Rhythm modulates perfectly: staccato discovery ("A sigh. Then a sob.") yields to lyrical closure, with all elision taught early (e.g., "climate shifts" context).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "curled like unborn birds" metaphor pays off without muddle. Minor deduction for "bruised twilight sky" (slight cliché), but propulsion remains clean: every line advances atmosphere or character, culminating in the restrained "She didn’t try to capture it."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms archivist trope via bone-deep sensitivity and walls as grief-holders. Emotional specificity ("tried to burn their grief, not hide it") avoids generic templates, while the ending’s burden-sharing risks sentimentality but lands through tactile details like soot on knees.</comment>
