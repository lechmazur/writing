<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's bitterness manifests physically (scar, tight throat) and through micro-choices (pressing SEND without dialing), but the "transmuted into gravitational giggles" epiphany edges toward thematic over-neatness, slightly flattening contradiction in the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: Moira’s "bitterness was never yours to carry" crystallizes the conceptual price while the tattoo-as-compass and "lighter than air" final image reconfigure Elara’s entire arc under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The bioluminescent vines constrain choices (dimming during gravity hiccup forces adaptation) and charge the climax (dissolving into auroras); cordless phone’s condensation directly affects Elara’s grip, making setting indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when arrowhead vibration causes boots to lose purchase, forcing Elara’s decisive SEND press. Cost is visceral (physical disorientation) but the bitterness-to-hope shift could deepen earlier; Moira’s "cosmos stole it" line salvages conceptual weight at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "spat it back as confetti" — a concrete, non-literal answer to bitterness’s weight. Avoids moralizing by embedding wisdom in Moira’s action (tossing thyme) and the final vine resonance, reweighting the opening "frostbitten heartbeats."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara’s perceptual signature shines ("static-laden confessions," "humming in E-flat"), with rhythm accelerating during gravity shifts ("books floated... teacups pirouetted"). Minor lexicon stretch: "syllables of collapsing stars" slightly exceeds researcher plausibility but fits escalating wonder.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; "gravitational giggles" risks purple prose but earns its place via concrete context (cosmic dust motes). Final line’s "lighter than air" delivers propulsion while recharging the gravity motif — no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specific physics: cordless phone as dimensional conduit, "temporal anomalies in clay pots." Emotional truth anchors the cosmic scale ("nights spent weeping into field notebooks"), but the Gravity Dancer’s "somersaulting" risks whimsy without the scar’s grounding weight.</comment>
