<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses (tinkerer using song, not tools) drive her preparation and final choice; the vine's tightening embodies cost of forgetting without label-speak. Minor flaw: her flawless execution lacks struggle depth in peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("It remembered too" during the sad verse); Accumulative lens holds through song's evolution from brittle to reclamation. No orientation debt—arbor/dawn established by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Vine tendril functions as micro-setting charging the final image (curling into wreath); sensory details like "threads of amber light spiraling" constrain Elara's method and reconfigure meaning. No generic placeholder weakness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stakes viscerally felt through song's progression: the "sadder" verse about steel fences/radios narrows options by deepening loss, while reclamation crescendo forecloses the path of silence with earned cost. Agency drives every escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "song was the first contract between human and earth" without moralizing; the final wreath offers non-literal answer to "why stop singing?" by reweighting moonroot as living invitation. No thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("brass goggles reflected first amber rays," "arbor hummed with memory") and rhythmic control under pressure (sentence length mirroring song's shift from brittle to golden) show zero head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels story ("She didn’t force the melody. She listened—to the sigh between notes"). Figurative language ("threads of amber light") enhances clarity without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tinkerer using salvaged gear for flute to restore practices via moonroot's song. Risk-taking heightens stakes—lyrical structure avoids traditional conflict yet feels inevitable through "pulse like sleeping heartbeat" specificity.</comment>
