<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "firmly grounded in both science and spirit" as she records without swooning; micro-choices like pressing the prism earn the renunciation of publication with visible cost in numb fingers and isolation. No secondary characters, so relationship bullets irrelevant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: melting frost "tracing paths like tears" crystallizes the cost of unshared truth. Accumulative lens holds throughout—pressure tightens via sensory density ("veins of white spreading") without causal turns, as required for this design.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Frost isn’t backdrop but active constraint: its geometry dictates prism alignment, and the melting final image charges closure with conceptual cost. Micro-setting (prism/frost interface) directly enables the climax’s "borrowed coat" revelation while avoiding overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: her alignment of prism with frost narrows options to silent witnessing. Cost is unmistakable in "fingers numb but steady" and the renunciation of validation, tightening under Accumulative lens via sensory deepening rather than reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "Emotion is mass. Memory is gravity"—a resonant, non-literal answer to "do objects hold memory?" Avoids moralizing; final rainbows "tasting of salt" reweight the premise without stating a moral, embracing complexity through the driver’s relief-as-peace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in scientific/spiritual duality ("reading braille left by forgotten gods"); rhythm modulates from lyrical ("mist curling like breath") to clipped climax ("She saw the driver’s last moments"). Zero filter verbs, with compression taught early via "truthful lie" phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line multiplies meaning ("frost’s geometry bending into faces" conveys revelation and method). Figurative language serves pressure without muddle—final "rainbows that tasted of salt" avoids sentimentality through sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "haunted object" trope via concrete mechanics (frost as diary) and emotional specificity ("tear that struck the dashboard and froze"). Risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes; "truthful lie" synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh, avoiding derivative safety.</comment>
