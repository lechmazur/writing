<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "sorrow could be rerouted, not erased" but lacks visible flaw manifestation beyond grief itself; micro-choices under pressure (burnishing coordinates) feel earned yet flaw remains abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly when curtains stir—cost is visceral in "someone had looked up. That was enough"—though conceptual cost slightly obscures physical stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Observatory’s timelessness constrains choice (no clocks enable suspension), but micro-setting doesn’t actively alter tactics; locket/curtains charge final image yet miss 9+ gate’s requirement for environmental pressure on choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when curtains stir, reweighting "gravity of grief" with felt cost, but price remains conceptual rather than tangible—band guardrail for 8.8+ requires visible cost shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image ("faintest warmth return") offers non-literal answer to "can grief bloom?" without moralizing; only flaw is slight over-explanation in "authenticity need not stem from nature."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("time pooled like spilled ink") and rhythmic control under pressure exceptional; minor register drift in "resonance—when enough longing pooled" slightly distances focalizer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density, and crystalline imagery ("breath on winter glass"); deduction for "resonance" abstraction in curtain description muddying physical logic at peak intensity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astronomy/grief via "curtains of intention" transforms tropes; deduction for slightly familiar "origami with messages" trope reducing irreplaceability.</comment>
