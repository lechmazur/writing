<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("bound by duty" vs. sacrifice) and embodied grief ("echoes clung to his ribs like frost") make the reaper’s final naming ritual feel earned. His micro-choices—trembling fingers, whispered phrases—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: weeping as he crystallizes grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly: density intensifies as light fades, culminating in Charged Poise closure where the pulsing atlas reconfigures fear with undeniable cost ("he wept quietly... echo was not hers alone"). No causality breaks; orientation anchors by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory’s shattered prism actively constrains the ritual—light angle dictates naming sequence—and charges the final image (crystallized atlas glowing in dark). Micro-setting (atlas page) evolves from "ghosts of leviathans" to "beacon," directly shaping the protagonist’s tactics under grief.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confronting nameless fear) tightens through the naming ritual, narrowing options to this singular act. Cost is unmistakable in the weeping climax: "the echo of sacrifice was not hers alone—it was his, too." Agency drives every deepening beat under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action—naming monsters as "witnesses" reweights fear into connection—without moralizing. Final image ("heart-carrier") resonates as a non-literal answer to "heartbroken," recharging the opening with earned complexity; avoids thematic echo entirely.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("amber light bled," "wind tugging like regret") modulates rhythm with pressure: fragmented syntax during grief ("not in face or voice, but in the hollow between heartbeats") shifts to lyrical cadence in the naming ritual. Zero head-hopping; voice remains reaper-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line multiplies meaning ("ink faded into ghosts of leviathans" ties setting to theme). Figurative language never muddles—"paper stiffened, and a thin layer of crystal bloomed"—and closure beat ("pulsed once—softly, warmly") achieves crystalline clarity under peak emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "naming fears" trope through specific reaper mythology and crystallization metaphor. Emotional truth avoids cliché—grief isn’t cured but "carried"—and the final reconfiguration ("heart-carrier") feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
