<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; thief's flawless benevolence avoids genuine struggle. Motivation is clear and embodied through actions like planting flowers, but no visible cost to her beyond tenderness undermines earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (depleting jar), but the cost lacks visceral legibility—it's poetic rather than earned through struggle. Orientation anchors station/time within 120 words, satisfying the test without penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly atmospheric ("moss-cracked tiles," "ivy-wrapped pillars") but functions as backdrop rather than constraint. Micro-setting (jar, flowers) charges the final image, meeting 9+ gate via recurring objects that shape choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes accumulate through two interventions, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—it's procedural repetition rather than deepening pressure. Cost (jar depletion) is visible but not emotionally legible; no trade-offs narrow options under rising tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through flower codes and moonbeams without moralizing. Final image ("Destiny’s door... waited for someone quiet enough") offers resonant non-literal answer, but avoids meaningful ambiguity—fate’s benevolence lacks counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("reading not faces but illuminated moments") with rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulates perfectly from "sigh" movements to "luminous disbelief," avoiding head-hopping in tight third-person limited POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless prose density with minor overwriting in peaks ("sky still bleeding the last hues"). "Luminous disbelief" edges toward label-speak, but rhythmic variation and concrete imagery prevent momentum loss in closure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specific mechanics: flower codes as organic fate-navigation system. Risk-taking with accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry, synthesizing "illuminated moments" into indispensable narrative logic.</comment>
