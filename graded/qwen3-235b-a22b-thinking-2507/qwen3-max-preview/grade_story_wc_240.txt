<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "letting go was not surrender. It was alignment," embodied through thumbing the worn laser button and dissolving the stranger. Avoids diagnostic labels; emotional progression layers grief with spatial precision. Near-9+ but "physics of letting go" edges toward abstraction without deeper causal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: stranger’s dissolution into bioluminescent dust charges the final image with visceral cost ("laser button clicked once, softly"). Accumulative lens holds—sensory pressure builds to crystallized moment where grief becomes permeable. Orientation perfect by 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: mushrooms dim as Aris moves, constraining her choice to release. Laser button transforms from relic to "key," charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy mirrors urgency—damp earth, harmonic resonance—avoiding symbolism. Meets 9+ gate via tool constraining closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (grief vs. permeability) signaled early; escalation through Aris’s walk toward the stranger narrows options to one irreversible choice. Cost crystallizes in the stranger’s dissolution—conceptual price of release made undeniable. Agency-driven deepening under Accumulative lens; "alignment" reweights the central conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "letting go was not of the person, but of the need to hold them in place" reweights grief as expansion. Final image ("luminous unknown") avoids moralizing but "physics of letting go" slightly abstracts the insight. Earned resonance via concrete particulars—no thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exceptional: "spatial gift humming in her veins," where curvature and resonance replace emotional labels. Rhythmic control peaks in dissolution scene ("Their fingers didn’t touch. They didn’t need to"). Zero head-hopping; compression taught early via dream fragments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cerulean and violet glow swelling like slow heartbeats" exemplifies layered density. Only hairline slip: "luminous unknown" feels slightly generic, but saved by preceding concrete action. Propulsion flawless—every sentence advances atmosphere or character under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: dimensional physics meets grief through bioluminescent mycelium. "Familiar strangers" transforms stock tropes via spatial mechanics. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry—"revolutionize departure" feels inevitable. Avoids derivative emotional templates.</comment>
