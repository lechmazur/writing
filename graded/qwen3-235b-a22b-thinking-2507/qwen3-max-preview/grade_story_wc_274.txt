<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete ("fingers trembled not from cold") and micro-choices under pressure (placing letter on Resonance Table) earn the final renunciation. Slight abstraction in "bravely conflicted" momentarily risks label-speak but is swiftly embodied through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost: "truth doesn’t need volume... only a heartbeat" crystallizes the stakes. Orientation clear by line 1; Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density reweights truth’s transmission.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Library setting actively constrains choice (Resonance Table mechanics) and charges closure—snow muffles world while walls whisper truth. Micro-setting (letter’s "iron and jasmine" scent) triggers the climax’s emotional contagion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Protagonist agency drives escalation: her decision to transmit via dormant networks narrows options to irreversible action. Cost unmistakable in regime’s scramble and her arrest; "silent, viral, unstoppable" deepens the dominant stake’s weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: weaponizing vulnerability as "confession into contagion." Ending offers non-literal answer via the archivist’s "heartbeat" line, reweighting truth’s transmission without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("breath the only sound") and rhythmic control under pressure ("dizzying quiet giving way to phantom voices"). Slight abstraction in "bravely conflicted" avoids diagnostic pitfalls through swift embodiment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion flawless ("cryo-wax cracked open with a sigh like breaking ice"). Figurative language serves pressure ("frost on glass") without muddle. Final line recharges "breath" motif with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival sci-fi and emotional contagion transforms "letter" trope into frequency/key metaphor. Risk-taking with quiet climax ("dizzying quiet of realization") heightens stakes coherently, avoiding derivative dystopia clichés.</comment>
