<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Historian's embodied emotion (oxygen debt, tears) and micro-choice to break ampoule feel earned, but statue's interiority remains symbolic rather than character-driven; "single narrative" conflict resolves with minimal contradictory impulses during pivotal shattering moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands powerfully when statue dissolves into garden while historian internalizes "carry nuance upward," with undeniable conceptual cost in her rewritten purpose; orientation anchors by line 3 prevent penalties.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Underwater garden actively constrains choices (kelp for dissolution, pressure suit limitations) and charges final image—"garden watched her go, animate in lifelessness"—fulfilling 9+ gate through environmental specificity driving transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when historian breaks ampoule against statue's fracture, narrowing options from scholarly pursuit to active rebirth advocacy; cost is legible in her emotional shift but escalation leans more on revelation density than pressure intensification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (breaking ampoule = shattering certainty), with final image reweighting "ruins" as "thresholds" without moralizing; glyphs' "Truth is mosaic" earns resonance through city's dissolution rather than abstract statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("phosphorescent orchids," "eels like liquid shadow") and rhythmic control under pressure; minor abstraction in telepathy descriptions ("cool as moonlit tide") prevents 9.0 despite flawless patterned elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-zero loops with high density ("violet dye swirling like captured dusk"), but "scalpel dipped in honey" creates slight figurative muddle in high-pressure beat; no closure artifacts preserve 8.8 eligibility despite one ornamental metaphor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of marine biology and philosophy transforms "drowned city" trope; "dissolved into sea's embrace" risks abstraction but earns specificity through coral-anemone metamorphosis details, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
