<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation ("savage need to touch untouchable") is embodied but lacks contradictory impulses; transformation is earned though micro-choices under pressure remain abstract. Final kneeling shows credible endurance but cost stays conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: "the tremor of certainty swelled... as its evolution" crystallizes stance with conceptual price. Orientation anchors by line 3 ("cobalt atrium," "ban lifted"), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through the humming colonnade's final dimming.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quartz colonnade constrains every choice (barefoot surrender, "Unfold" verb) and charges the final image—lake ice fracturing into "constellations" reweights boundaries. Micro-setting (glacial marble underfoot) embodies stakes without ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency as pillars "whisper syllables" during her passage, narrowing options toward "Unfold." Cost is legible in her identity shift ("not to conquer but to coexist"), but escalation relies on a single deepening beat rather than layered pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "paraphrase" motif reweighted at closure: stepping on ice becomes "commune," not "cross." Final image ("world remembered how to listen") offers non-literal resolution without moralizing, avoiding sentimentality through concrete particulars like lantern-moth benedictions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frozen lake holding its breath") modulates with pressure; rhythmic control peaks during the dance ("each step a stanza"). No head-hopping, though "savage need" slightly abstracts interiority under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops, but "tremor of certainty... like a seed cracking stone" risks mixed metaphor. Final line’s cadence ("the poet remained") achieves textural precision without obscuring closure’s earned stasis.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "artist breaks oppression" trope via specific physics (quartz harmonics, ice fracturing into constellations). Risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens stakes—victory as "softening" boundaries feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
