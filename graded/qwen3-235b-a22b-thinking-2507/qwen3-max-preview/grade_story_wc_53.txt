<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction manifests physically through camera winding and fragment collection; ghost’s gesture-based communication reveals character under pressure. Final choice to accept the envelope earns renunciation via prior causality, though "ambition was a ladder" risks abstraction but is redeemed by concrete context.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost in the envelope’s "never meant to fix the past" revelation. Accumulative lens holds perfectly: each collected fragment tightens emotional density toward the ghost’s demand to "develop this," with the 37th exposure counting as meaningful escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The disposable camera (micro-setting) directly charges the final image—its empty film and the envelope reprise the "framing" motif. Salt-crusted planks and twin moons constrain choices, while "bruised purple" moonlight evolves causally with the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (negotiating with ghost-self) tightens through protagonist’s agency: winding the camera, collecting fragments, then surrendering it. The ghost’s shift from whispering desires to demanding "develop this" creates deepening with felt cost in the relinquishment of fixing the past.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete "framing" mechanics (camera, journal, envelope), avoiding moralizing. The handwritten note reweights ambition’s illusion without abstraction; final "do not regret" resonates through the envelope’s physicality, not stated philosophy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "laughter calcified in abandoned ticket stubs"; rhythm modulates from dense lyricism to stark final lines. Zero head-hopping; "twin moons rise — one silver, one bruised purple" exemplifies character-particular noticing under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "flickering in and out like faulty neon" shows textural specificity. Sentence rhythms vary organically (staccato for tension: "Not for a truce. Not for forgiveness."). Final line’s simplicity contrasts powerfully with earlier density without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "ghost" trope through chronologically confused time and camera motif; "framing" concept feels inevitable in hindsight. Avoids sentimentality in regret portrayal—the lagoon-as-ambition metaphor is brilliantly specific, not derivative.</comment>
