<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; serene resolve reads as competence without struggle. "None of it broke her" feels unearned without visible vulnerability or cost in micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost (0.7° hope shift, timeline realignments), but the stakes lack visceral urgency. Obsidian disc resolution risks convenience—its arrival feels coincidental rather than earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grotto setting constrains every choice: tide dictates timing, wet stone guides pattern-making, and the gauge’s resonance depends on environmental acoustics. Final image ("tide polished the stones") charges closure by echoing cyclical renewal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes (hope’s solubility across timelines) deepen through pattern recalibration, but pressure lacks tangible escalation. The resonance cascade resolves conflict without protagonist sacrifice—cost remains abstract despite lyrical "0.7 degrees" quantification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (grief-to-lift balloon), not abstraction. Final image ("multiverse exhaled, lighter") reweights hope as collective burden-sharing, avoiding moralizing while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("moonlight fractured on wet stone," "hydrodynamic script") reflects the dreamer’s scientific-poetic lens. Rhythmic control tightens during high-pressure beats ("needle stilled. Then swung wide") without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("serenely upheaving the fabric of what-could-be" integrates action/theme). Minor overwriting risk in "logarithmic spirals humming faintly," but payoff in closure imagery justifies lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mathematical hope and tidal physics avoids genre clichés. "Trial balloons as hypotheses" transforms tropes through specific, character-driven mechanics (e.g., 0.7° emotional latitude).</comment>
