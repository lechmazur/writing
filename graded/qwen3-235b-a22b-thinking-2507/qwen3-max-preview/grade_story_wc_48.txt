<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but motivation remains abstract; manuscript's unfinished state lacks visceral felt cost despite strong embodied emotion ("tide pools at dawn"). No concrete tradeoffs from "lucidly watchful" trait visible in choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (unfinished manuscript "pulsing with potential"), but orientation ambiguity past 120 words isn't taught early enough—disorientation payoff at mist thinning arrives too late for full waiver.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice (walking "sideways," muffling footsteps) and charges final image ("swirling hush" becoming "whisper of closing pages"). Pier transition grounds closure with tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("closure as myth") deepens through cameo accumulation, but escalation isn't driven by protagonist agency—mist guides her. Conceptual cost is unmistakable ("manuscript remained unfinished" yet "pulsed with potential").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image ("shapes of different hopes swam beneath the surface... to be honored") offers resonant non-literal answer to "longing vs. release" without moralizing. Theme emerges purely through accumulated cameos, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("rain that tasted of ink and salt") shines, but "gulls crying like editors demanding revisions" breaks POV plausibility—novelist wouldn't articulate avian sounds as editorial demands mid-catharsis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in opening ("ephemeral cameo appearances that flickered like candlelight in a draft" stacks two similes). No loops, but "swirling hush" repetition in Q9J slightly redundant without deepening charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of writer's block via "feral nexus" and "shapes of hopes" avoids cliché. Specific details (constellations coat, dandelion seeds as punctuation) transform tropes through character-grounded logic.</comment>
