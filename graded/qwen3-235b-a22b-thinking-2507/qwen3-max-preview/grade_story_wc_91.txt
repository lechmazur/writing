<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation for "texture of transformation" feels earned through embodied choices (kneeling, whispering "you're allowed to rest"), but abstract phrasing like "grief becomes grace" edges toward diagnostic label-speak without sufficient concrete friction in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "heart grew heavier with belonging" crystallizes the emotional trade-off, and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through the final "HERE. NOW. YOU." reconfiguration without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Black sand actively constrains choices (bug burrowing, evaporating tears) and charges the final image ("gleamed" beach), satisfying the 9+ gate by functioning as micro-setting that alters tactics and final resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via protagonist agency intensifies through each bug release, narrowing options toward the pivotal fourth bottle (her unlived life), with visible cost in the "heavier heart" that reweights the dominant stake of transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through concrete particulars (ash/fertile ground, bottled destinies), with the final light trail offering a resonant, non-literal answer to "texture of transformation" without moralizing or stated thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in volcanic sand "sighing" and celestial "waltz," with rhythmic control under pressure ("She didn’t flinch. She’d learned...") avoiding any head-hopping in this single-POV piece.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor mixed metaphor ("waltz of stars... bent time like taffy") and slightly forced simile ("mist curled like loyal cats") create subtle line-level artifacts, but propulsion remains clean with no scaffold loops in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "bottled unlived lives" trope through volcanic setting and accidental prophecy fulfillment feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking lyrical structure heightening stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
