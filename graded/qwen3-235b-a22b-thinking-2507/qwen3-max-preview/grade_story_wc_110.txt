<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority and embodied emotion shine (e.g., "breath even" amid tension), but secondary keepers lack depth—Tannis/Vorr reduced to single gestures despite pivotal roles. Micro-choices under pressure limited to Elira’s stillness; child’s trust arrives without prior characterization. Strength: contradictory impulses in "ambiguously clear clarity" belief versus fear of shattering. Flaw: secondary characters function as symbols, not individuals.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands flawlessly: lens cracking signifies completion with visible cost ("collective release of withheld truths" made tangible through humming and tears). Orientation clear by word 30 ("abandoned Municipal Archives Annex"). Minor escalation dip as keepers gather without resistance, but pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens via sensory density. Cost proof: "residual light" humming in broken lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt actively constrains choices—rain pools refract light for the lens, quartz veins dictate droplet behavior, and "metronomic" drips set rhythm. Final image of fading doodles under new sun charges closure by showing truth absorbed. Micro-setting (projector lens) directly shapes tactics: its angle creates the pivotal light effect. No generic placeholder; specificity fuels momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("truth will shatter what remained") tightens through Elira’s lens placement, narrowing options to silent vulnerability. Cost is visceral: Tannis’s trembling touch, Vorr grounding himself, collective weeping. Escalation driven by protagonist agency (placing tickets/lens), but keepers’ shift lacks friction—no resistance tested. Strength: "resonant hush" reweights stakes through humming, making silence generative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: doodles "shifting" meaning via heart, not intellect; tickets fading as "message absorbed." Final image rejects moralizing—transparency’s cost is the lens cracking, not speeches. Avoids "thematic echo" by showing (not telling) how ambiguity enables trust. Resonant non-literal answer: "cryptic doodles" becoming unnecessary through lived understanding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elira notices "spaces between breaths," "tremble in a held teacup." Rhythmic control under pressure—"resonant hush" sentence accelerates tension; lyrical cadence modulates with emotional intensity. Zero head-hopping; focalization stays anchored to Elira’s sensory bias. Strength: "liquid stars" reframing droplets as emotional metaphors without overwriting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence propels (e.g., "moonlight pierced the clouds" triggers action). High density: "cryptic doodles" phrase evolves meaning across beats. Final line’s rhythm ("no longer needed, their message absorbed") resolves with charged specificity. Minor deduction: "trembling circle of silver" slightly overwrought but redeemed by context. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis: "honesty as ambiguous clarity" transforms reconciliation tropes via projector lens and concert tickets. Emotional truth in keepers’ wordless reactions avoids generic templates. Fresh inflection: doodles as "emotional contours" reweighting truth’s cost. Risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes—resolution through humming, not speeches. Derivative guardrail passed: specificity (quartz eaves, teacup tremors) prevents abstraction.</comment>
