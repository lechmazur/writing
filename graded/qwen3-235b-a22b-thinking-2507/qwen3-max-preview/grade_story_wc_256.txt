<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but abstract; motivation clear yet lacks concrete stakes to ground "texture of connection." Micro-choices minimal (placing lens/singing), though embodied emotion shines in "grain of each vanished voice like braille on her soul." No secondary character to test relationships.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: vibration sequence deepens density without causal turns. Closure (Charged Poise) lands with felt cost in "seeds of texture" realization. Weakness: cost remains diffuse—tears of recognition lack specific forfeiture beyond abstract epiphany.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choices: quartz pedestal positions lens, vacuum tubes respond to sound. Miner's lens functions as micro-setting charging closure ("crack now glowing"). Final image transforms lab from "fossilized silence" to resonant vessel, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes remain philosophical ("why instant connection?") without concrete pressure narrowing options. Escalation is textural (vibration → prismatic echoes) but lacks trade-off; singing resolves tension without visible cost beyond emotional recognition. Band guardrail for 8.0+ unmet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "seeds of texture" reconfiguration—rejects digital saturation with "imperfect, gloriously human resonance." Final image avoids moralizing while answering "what if quiet is where listening begins?" No thematic echo or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice distinct via sensory-perceptual signature ("cobalt for longing, amber for comfort"). Rhythmic control under pressure: short clauses during vibration ("struck the fork—not with force, but with reverence"). No head-hopping; lyric compression taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; "fractured it, and cast prismatic echoes" demonstrates high density. Minor synonym churn in "saturation—everyone plugged in, yet no one truly listening" but no closure impact. Figurative language precise even in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms post-grid tropes through sensory specificity (miner's lens refracting grief as violet). Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off via Charged Poise closure. "Seeds" reconfiguration feels inevitable yet fresh, avoiding safety-middle hedging.</comment>
