<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (retired vs. active listening) drives micro-choices like silent doorknob turns; final key acceptance earned by prior ritualized lies. Slight deduction for "grammar in gables" abstraction diluting embodied motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands via "seal heavy... key cold" with conceptual cost; Accumulative lens holds through density increase in tea ritual revelations. Orientation perfect by line 3; no causality breaks despite quiet escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rooftop garden’s sigh and meteor shower pressure the key exchange; seal functions as micro-setting charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy masterful (moss tracing, tea-stained origami) with zero ornamental detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through reciprocal revelation ("gargoyles weep before storms" to basement vault), narrowing options via protagonist’s agency. Cost legible in physical weight of seal/key; single deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "sugar/honey" ritual and seal’s translation role; final image reweights "language of buildings" without moralizing. Avoids Thematic Echo flaw while making conceptual cost undeniable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "moss between flagstones" and "crumbling facades"; rhythm modulates flawlessly from lyrical to taut during key exchange. Dialogue subtext ("Third-floor joists sing") embodies voice distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; "fleeting silver scars" shows density without muddle. Minor deduction for "syntax in mortar" abstraction, but saved by concrete context. Final line avoids sentimentality with resonant action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms "sentient building" trope via linguistic framing; emotional truth in retired academics’ ritualized half-truths. Risk-taking in quiet escalation pays off through specific details (brass seal, Darjeeling).</comment>
