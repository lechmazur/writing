<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices: trembling fingers tracing the smudge while pinning the orchid reveals simultaneous desire for truth-release and artistic honesty. No diagnostic label-speak; the "glacier" metaphor emerges organically from her physical reality. Micro-choices under pressure—quartz shard placement, facing the oracle—earn her endurance with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "shivering" and "first true inhale" crystallize the stakes while the pinned orchid reconfigures truth’s weight. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—the aurora’s "weeping light" reweights silence’s gravity without causal turns. Orientation clear by line 5; no causality breaks mar the pressure accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The botanical illustration functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: smudged petal pinned with childhood quartz directly constrains her action and reweights truth’s value. Sensory details ("snowflakes stung... sharp as regret") filter through her grief without cliché. Recurring object essential to closure—removing it collapses the thematic charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: her whispered query to the oracle ("What do I do with it?") forces the rupture that culminates in pinning the illustration. Cost is unmistakable—"shivering" and "cold remained"—while the "glacier" metaphor interweaves internal/external conflict. Single escalation suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the smudged orchid’s evolution from "fiction" to "honest" reweights truth without moralizing. Final image—"weigh the truth... in breaths reclaimed"—offers non-literal resolution to "swallowed truths" while avoiding thematic echo. Complexity lingers in "quiet courage of unswallowed words yet to come."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: "wind gnashed... alpine rage" and "auroral sorrow" reflect her fractured state through professional/weathered lens. Rhythmic control under pressure—"Let the wind revise it. Let the snow bleach..."—compresses diction without sacrificing clarity. Oracle’s dialogue distinct in cadence yet seamless within her POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts: "snowflakes stung her cheeks, sharp as regret" avoids cliché through precise verbs and charged metaphor. Every sentence multi-tasks—e.g., "instruments measured snowpack... but none measured the weight" weaves setting with theme. Final line’s cadence ("It endured. As she would.") delivers propulsion without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "fault-tolerant" from tech trope into human endurance through quartz shard and smudged orchid. Emotional specificity in "auroral sorrow" avoids generic grief, while the oracle’s poetic logic ("gravity bends time") feels earned, not gimmicky. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
