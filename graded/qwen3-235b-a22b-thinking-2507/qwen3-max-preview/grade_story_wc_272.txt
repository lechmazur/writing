<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: avoids redemption while seeking coherence through pain. Micro-choices like stitching the Tower to childhood sketch reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Only near-therapy-speak "pain was the price" slightly mars embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly—walls closing to cocoon charges cost via "luminescent ache of transformation." Accumulative lens holds throughout with density building to inversion. No orientation debt; cost proven in ribs-as-tuning-forks sensation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The silver needle functions as micro-setting: it constrains choices (stitching threads) and charges closure (stepping on tapestry triggers inversion). Sensory details filtered through fractured perception—"bruised twilight," "unborn colors humming"—avoid symbolism while mirroring internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize when she steps on the tapestry: physical action forecloses old reality (lighthouse groans, sea rises vertically). Agency drives escalation—stitching to stepping to eyelid-painting—with visceral cost in "bone must break to grow correctly." No coincidence resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image of "crestRISEN" self-portrait with stitched parchment wings offers resonant answer to "fracture as feature" without moralizing. Theme emerges organically from particulars: roots growing from Tower rubble reweights collapse as generative, avoiding binaries through overlapping worlds in her eyes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is airtight: notices "whispering alphabets" and "languages that cracked teeth" consistent with artist-protagonist. Voice modulates perfectly—lyrical in calm ("shelves leaned like drunkards"), compressed under stress ("She didn’t flinch"). Zero head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line multiplies meaning ("cards scattered like fallen constellations" ties tarot to cosmic collapse). Metaphors coherent ("ribs became tuning forks struck by the dark"). Final line charges closure without telling: "walls still intimate with collapse."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tarot + cartography + self-portraiture as tools for metaphysical repair. Emotional truth in "stitched parchment wings"—specific to her artist identity—avoids cliché. Risks lyrical structure but pays off with Charged Poise closure where walls cocooning feels inevitable.</comment>
