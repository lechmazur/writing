<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak; grief manifests as "checking smoke detectors," not labels. Contradictory impulses act in scene: she ignores the kettle to sculpt, trading safety for containment. Final choice earned through tactile progression from blank to vessel.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through sensory density until Earned Stasis ("Let the water boil dry"). Cost is legible in kettle abandonment and crystallized wood shavings. Orientation clear by word 10; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Loft functions as micro-setting: rain-wept glass mirrors tears, cedar chest holds "Before" memories. Ash wood constrains choice (sculpting vs. duty) and charges final image—lion on sunlit windowsill reweights grief. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (ignores boiling kettle for wood grain).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (containing grief) tightens via chisel action: "let the first curl peel away" narrows options to art over safety. Escalation driven by agency ("pressed its tip to the blank"), not coincidence. Cost crystallized in kettle abandonment—prioritizing wisdom over mundane survival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ash wood’s transformation: "vessel" reweights grief as containable residue, not absence. Final mantra ("Here, and gone. But never lost") offers resonant CR without moralizing. Avoids abstraction via concrete stakes (boiling kettle vs. carving).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: notices "watery gold" light, "rust-hued peace." Voice modulates under stress—short sentences during chiseling ("She didn’t rise. Instead, she exhaled"). Zero head-hopping; compression ("Here and gone") taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fine as a lion’s whisker" shows high density. Rhythm accelerates with chisel work ("peel away"), breathes in reflection. "Crystallized" repetition functions as motif, not muddle—closure image ("watery gold") flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes: "vessel not memorial" synthesis feels inevitable. Risk-taking (quiet Earned Stasis ending) heightens stakes without gimmickry. "Hauntingly practical" detail ("labeling jars") grounds universality in lived specificity.</comment>
