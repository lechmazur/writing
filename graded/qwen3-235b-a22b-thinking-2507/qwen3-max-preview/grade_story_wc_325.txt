<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in embodied claustrophobia and salt-coated sensory details; micro-choice of placing gold fleck earns climax. Lacks contradictory impulses beyond fear/weight dichotomy, slightly thin on pre-climax value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: "unremembered stood a little taller" crystallizes stance with undeniable conceptual cost (spent fleck, salt on lips). Orientation flawless by line 3; Accumulative lens held through tidal pressure and memory resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Research facility actively constrains choices (tidal timing, collapsing structure) and charges final image—"cables carry remembrance." Gold fleck as micro-setting object alters climax tactics. Sensory specificity ("binary frost," "petrified sandwiches") avoids white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes (honoring forgotten) signaled early; tidal clock creates meaningful deepening. Escalation driven by environmental pressure rather than active protagonist choices (she executes grandfather's plan), slightly weakening agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: child's drawing reweighted to glow, humming cables now "carry remembrance." Final image offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids all anti-patterns—no thematic echo or abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: spelunker notices conduits/tidal shifts; rhythm modulates from staccato ("She didn't run.") to lyrical flow. Zero head-hopping. Under peak stress, voice stays uniformly poetic rather than compressing per character state.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "binary frost" shows textural specificity. Sentences vary rhythm masterfully. Minor overwriting risk in "phantom signals/data ghosts" but pattern taught early and paid off in closure imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "haunted facility" trope via codex gold fleck mechanics and cables as memory vessels. Fresh angle: "returning presence" not objects. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry—closure image reweights everything.</comment>
