<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira's interior contradiction (grief vs defiance) drives micro-choices like playing "until the needle stills," but "steely longing" leans toward label without sufficient embodied struggle in peak beats; the clock's ticking reaction shows strong character-pressure fusion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: time restarting with conceptual cost (midnight continuing) reconfigures fate's rule-set; causal lens holds flawlessly from film reel setup to shattering dawn, with the clock's movement proving tangible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Tidal arbor's condensation on keys and gravity-bending music constrain choices, but environment doesn't actively pressure climax tactics; prismatic vapor spray charges the final dawn image yet lacks irreplaceable constraint for 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elira's agency: film reel instructions force "play until needle stills," narrowing options to the final chord; cost is unmistakable as time restarts with laughter's echo, though early fate resistance could feel more viscerally threatened.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action—shattering horizon as "non-literal answer" to surprising fate—avoiding moralizing; the flame-burst film reel reweights "unplanned encore" with irreversible cost, no thematic echo detected.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("ivory keys slick with condensation," "hailstones the size of teacups"); rhythmic control accelerates during the climax ("She played faster. Not with desperation, but precision") with no head-hopping or voice drift under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but "emotion conducted physics here more reliably than equations" risks thematic abstraction in a high-pressure beat, slightly dulling sensory immediacy despite otherwise masterful propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specific mechanics: film reel compasses as emotional coordinates reconfigure fate; "steely longing" modulating to triumphant grief avoids cliché, with tidal arbor's physics making the premise feel inevitable.</comment>
