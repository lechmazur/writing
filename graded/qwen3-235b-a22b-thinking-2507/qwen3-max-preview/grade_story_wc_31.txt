<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "truth hides behind truth" refrain, but dive sequence lacks embodied struggle—cold water’s impact remains observational rather than visceral under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "no longer searching, but signifying" crystallizes stakes with felt cost. Minor tension in ledger discovery—vow predating birth risks convenient revelation rather than earned causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Drowned library micro-setting constrains choice (diving pressure) and charges closure ("ledger’s ink pulsed once"). Key tag’s tactile evolution—from "heavier than iron" to "warm against his skin"—exemplifies object-as-setting mastery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when vow predating birth forecloses search path, but escalation lacks physical cost during dive—water’s resistance feels atmospheric rather than actively narrowing options under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image ("truth hides behind truth, not to deceive, but to deepen") offers resonant answer without moralizing. Vow registry transforms abstract theme into concrete cost—his name signed decades prior reweights the entire premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is immaculate: "paper bellies glowing like drowned stars reborn" filters setting through lamplighter’s trade. Minor diction drift in "alchemical blend" slightly jars from his voice during high-pressure dive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion via rhythmic compression ("cold water swallowing his breath like a vow"). One borderline overwriting risk: "cerulean streaked with amber" dazzles but nearly obscures the pivotal sound-color revelation beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "luminous vows" trope through drowned-library specificity and ROOM 7 key’s causal integration. Risk-taking (dive-as-epiphany) heightens stakes without gimmickry—ledger pulse as closure feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
