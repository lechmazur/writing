<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in the trembling hands and stone's wilting, revealing his lie through embodied action rather than therapy-speak. Micro-choice to sing instead of oil gears crystallizes his shift from technician to truth-bearer, with cost visible in his teeth-aching guilt and eventual tears of wonder.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as the dancer's motion reconfigures options—shadows recoil from reclaimed light with undeniable conceptual cost. Under Accumulative lens, pressure tightens through sensory density (chamber resonance, midnight approach) culminating in the singing beat, with orientation anchored by "polished brass gears under lamplight" within 20 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Resonance chamber functions as essential micro-setting: copper pipes constrain choices (must use resonance) and charge closure as light "swirls from the dancer's motion." Sensory details evolve causally—from "humming minor chords" of guilt to "amber and gold" wonder—avoiding static description by tethering to emotional progression.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (reclaim light before midnight) tightens through the stone's wilting and approaching shadows. His singing choice forecloses mechanical fixes with visceral cost—teeth-aching guilt transforming into "tinkersong wonder"—driven entirely by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "covenant of rust" transforms from legend to lived truth via copper oxide lacing gears. Final image—light reclaiming space through the dancer's motion—offers resonant answer to "mending what isn't torn" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo by rooting insight in the repairman's singing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("syllables worn smooth by generations, each note a pebble dropped into still water") reflects the tinker's worldview. Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure—staccato sentences for tension ("It pulsed. And wilted.") yielding to flowing cadence at resolution—without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; every line multiplies functions ("threads of copper oxide... not corroding but connecting" advances plot/theme/image). Sentence rhythms vary purposefully with scene needs, and metaphors serve mechanics ("like a sunflower toward dawn") without muddling closure's crystalline light imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specificity: philosopher's stone becomes truth-sensor, "midnight" as literal shadow-threat. Emotional truth anchors fantasy—the orphan's lost smile feels human. Risk-taking (abstract "covenant of rust" made tangible via copper oxide) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, achieving fresh synthesis in hindsight.</comment>
