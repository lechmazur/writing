<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses (hunter's focus vs. maternal recognition) through embodied choices like tracing the crank handle. Final renunciation of "dynasty ender" identity carries visible cost but minor over-reliance on metaphor ("bones as tuning forks") under peak stress slightly undermines specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost: "She was not the end... she was its restoration" reconfigures identity under Accumulative lens. Orientation anchors by word 30, but the cylinder's maternal-voice reveal lacks sufficient prior causality to justify 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sepia reading room actively constrains choices (dust-sighing chairs demand stillness, wood grain holds "residual anguish") and charges the final image. Crank handle's evolution from "cold brass" to "relic of awakening" exemplifies micro-setting necessity, though "golden shadows" tone remains static.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single tightening through sensory accumulation ("harmonic shimmered... pulses, sighs, cadence") narrows options to identity dissolution. Stakes deepen organically via protagonist's agency in cranking, but the emotional cost feels slightly abstract without tangible consequence beyond realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "truth hums" earns resonance via exile training, not moralizing. Final image ("walk—calmly, irrevocably—toward the clocktower") offers non-literal answer to "dynasty ender" question, though "coronation of understanding" borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("standing waves," "residual anguish") and rhythmic control shine under pressure—longer sentences when calm fracture into fragments at climax ("The voice was her mother's"). Zero head-hopping; syntax mirrors focalizer's hunter-poet duality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("needle kissed the groove... faint harmonic shimmered") but "cracked and thin as ancient parchment" creates mixed metaphor in peak beat. Minor redundancy in "golden shadows" description deducts 0.3 without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specific, grounded choices: gramophone as truth-resonator, "standing waves" intuition method. Risk-taking (quiet Charged Poise climax) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "dynasty ender" title feels slightly on-the-nose.</comment>
