<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete ("fingertips brushing spines as if reading whispers") and motivation clear, but emotional cost remains abstract; final decision to descend lacks visible struggle against fatigue or doubt despite implied burden of memory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure lands powerfully: "pack the diaries... descend into the underlibrary" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost (shouldering memory's weight), though the tapestry connection slightly delays escalation until 60% mark.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Reclaimed silo library actively constrains choices (ash vial, bronze lamp light) and charges closure; "cracked mortar" discovery site directly enables the pivotal diary find that reshapes her mission.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving memory against entropy) is clear, but conflict remains observational rather than active; "displaced axis" deepens understanding without narrowing options or testing her resolve under pressure until the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through objects: "follow the thread that dragons guard" reweights the tapestry from decoration to guide, avoiding moralizing while the "walls smiled back" image resonates without stating meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct ("silence grew teeth—gnawing at meaning") with strong perceptual signature, but "sensitively perceptive" abstraction slightly dilutes embodied immediacy during high-pressure deciphering.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless rhythm ("glow pooled like liquid metal") with minor overwriting in "diaries half-burned, ledgers mildewed, maps frayed"; no artifacts dull closure but "abstract landscapes" slightly strains metaphor coherence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival labor and cosmic repair avoids post-apocalyptic tropes; "dragons mending rifts" transforms familiar symbols through concrete stakes (realigning stories to stand upright).</comment>
