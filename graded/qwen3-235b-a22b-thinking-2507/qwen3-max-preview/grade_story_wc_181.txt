<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices ("kernels uncracked" vs. opening the cameo); final renunciation of linear inheritance earned by absorbing future selves with visceral cost in "marrow like a second skeleton".</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "Again" reweights inheritance from bloodline to resonance, crystallized by dissolving petals charging her skin with lived failures/successes—felt cost anchors the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Astral orchard’s micro-setting constrains every choice: floating scrolls force tactile inquiry, blossoms shifting from ancestors to future selves charge the final image; "brightened disquiet" evolves from atmosphere to embodied marrow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency—her bathroom inquiry triggers glyph revelation—but conceptual cost ("resonance across possibilities") lacks tangible forfeiture beyond epiphany; escalation deepens knowledge without physical trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: "gaps between pages" reconfigured as "field to be harvested" via petal dissolution; no moralizing, only resonant image of selves un-lived charging the final walk.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("cataloged life," "chronal sashes") and rhythmic control under pressure; bathroom scene’s absurdity modulates voice without head-hopping, taught early and paid off in glyph emergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>Near-zero loops; "brightened disquiet" risks overwriting but gains propulsion through concrete embodiment ("clinging like static" → "settling into marrow"); final line’s "bloomed brighter in her wake" crystallizes density without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>Transforms "forbidden knowledge" trope through specific mechanics: nonlinear inheritance as active resonance harvested via bathroom breakthroughs; "pistachio shell cameo" synthesizes fragility and potential with irreplaceable thematic weight.</comment>
