<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("rebellion without responsibility was just another losing bet") and embodied emotion ("clover melancholy") drive micro-choices like leaving scrawls. Final "Begin again" renunciation earned by father’s recognition and scrawl dialogue, with cost in her quiet ache.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "Begin again" reconfigures "traverse" with undeniable cost (father’s illness, emotional burden). Accumulative lens holds through scrawl patterns; rain erasing chalk motif charges final image. Orientation clear in opening line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mica pane constrains choices (decoding scrawls) and charges closure (shadows "curling gently"). Library’s wet paper/cedar smell and rain pressure her mental traversal, evolving with lightning’s effect on the lantern. Final ink line reweights the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (widening perspectives responsibly) tightens via scrawl dialogue escalation ("P(success) undefined until you traverse"). Cost is visceral in father’s rehab monitors and Elara’s trembling chalk. Agency drives every turn under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "rain erases chalk" becomes permanent lesson. Final "Begin again" offers resonant answer to "traverse" without moralizing. Complexity avoids false equivalence (e.g., "bet on loss" as utility reassessment).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("conditional probability," "entropy") filters all details. Voice modulates under pressure (staccato during scrawl decoding vs lyrical in closure). Zero head-hopping; focalization stays anchored in her probabilistic lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "flickered in lucid contradictions" does triple duty. Final line’s green ink propels closure without muddle. Slight register drift in "theoretically rebellious" (told vs shown) costs 0.1 but doesn’t touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of probability theory and mystical searching transforms "cryptic messages" trope. Emotional specificity ("clover melancholy" → pressed clover) avoids quirkiness. Risk-taking (math as spiritual lens) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
