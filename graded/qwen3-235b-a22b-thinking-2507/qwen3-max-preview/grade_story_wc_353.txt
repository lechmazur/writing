<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s embodied motivation ("strummed the air... hoping to jar loose a note") and micro-choices (carving resonance chambers, not figures) reveal profound interiority under pressure. Final endurance—being "sculpted by the trees"—earns closure through causal progression, though hedgehog/siskins lack character agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Silas’s tears crystallize cost ("recognition" of being reshaped), with the grove’s humming reconfiguring silence-as-potential under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is anchored instantly ("dawn," "alder grove"), avoiding all penalties.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The alder grove’s micro-setting (crackled porcelain, humming wood) constrains every choice and charges the final image ("humming with memory of music"). Sensory details ("bark shimmered silver," "tears tracking slow paths") evolve causally with the sculpture’s activation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation via Silas’s agency: analyzing cracks shapes the resonance chamber, turning fracture into frequency. The cost—his transformation from creator to created—is unmistakable in the grove’s irreversible awakening and his tears of recognition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (porcelain’s "fractures turned into frequency"), avoiding abstraction. But "Empathy in motion—that was the true sculpture" near climax risks thematic echo, slightly diluting the non-literal resonance of the final humming grove.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "bark still humming with last night’s frost," "fractures bent like river deltas of sorrow." Rhythmic control under pressure ("He mapped their intersections... each one a note") avoids head-hopping despite multi-shard structure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; "fissure was a frozen cry... mapped their intersections" avoids paraphrase through purposeful cadence. High density ("embedded the insulator... cracks aligned with grain-lines") propels closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis: transforming porcelain "stress fractures" into musical conduits reweights silence-as-failure into connection. Risk-taking (Accumulative/Textural lens) heightens stakes coherently—the grove’s awakening feels inevitable through prior particulars.</comment>
