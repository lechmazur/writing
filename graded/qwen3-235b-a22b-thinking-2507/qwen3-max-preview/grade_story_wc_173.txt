<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak; "alarming serenity" embodies contradiction through "furnace of refusal" melting snow. Flaw: Hubris of harvesting madness lacks tangible consequence beyond abstract resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost: "furnace of her refusal" visibly melts snow while echoes spill outward. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds—density escalates through thread releases to reconfigure silence into "memory given motion."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Snow constrains choice ("melting not from warmth") and charges closure (bare feet leaving no prints). Prism threads function as micro-setting—knots dictate her rhythmic labor, making environment indispensable to tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (resonance vs. lullaby) tightens via thread releases: each echo deepens cost (startled birds, dissolving snow). Agency-driven escalation peaks with "I remember you" dissolving the knot—cost legible in physical toll but slightly abstracted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "lullaby that told souls to be still" crystallizes into "defiant hum." Final image reweights premise without moralizing—"braided into fabric of all that dared to speak" resonates beyond plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "snowflakes settled like benedictions" filters world through poetic lens. Rhythm modulates perfectly—long sentences for contemplation, stark fragments ("She did not flinch") under pressure. Zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; "spectral seed" and "sugar in tea" metaphors avoid cliché through precise context. Slight overwriting risk in "chandelier of frozen tears," but "furnace of refusal" compensates with propulsion and visceral charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"Bodily poetic" transforms courtesan trope: chastity as active resistance, not piety. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightens stakes—echoes as "wheat" made tactile via thread mechanics without gimmickry.</comment>
