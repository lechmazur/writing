<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "terror of nearing truth" tied to buried dissertations, not abstract labels; micro-choices like inventing "forgiveness" earn her quiet renunciation with palpable cost in the final bow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the seedling's unwritten symbol crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost ("touching distance" as foreclosed path), while Accumulative lens deepens through resonant density without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Magnetic arbor constrains every choice—field holds cuneiform signs, "soil-memory" dictates planting rules—and charges the final image as tendrils mirror its bark, making setting indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by Elira’s analogical agency: drawing signs narrows options to "touching distance," with the felt cost of relinquishing control crystallizing in her stepped-back departure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete struggle—transition as "reconfiguration," not rupture—avoiding moralizing; the unwritten symbol offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question with conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature evident in "clay wedged meaning" metaphors and rhythmic control ("Not from wind. Not from magic. From resonance"), though "marrow" slightly edges toward cliché under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; peak beats like the seed’s grace-filled split achieve high density without figurative muddle, while final lines ("She bowed. And left.") deliver crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cuneiform scholarship and physics of transition feels inevitable, with "inverted gravity" geomancer vanishing transforming tropes into emotionally specific, risk-taking conceptual repricing.</comment>
