<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "beauty in struggle" epiphany, but "hopeful melancholy" naming edges toward label-speak; micro-choices like pocketing the stone as compass earn closure without over-tidying.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable conceptual cost in "truths arrive too late to save kingdoms, but just in time to save souls"; accumulative lens holds through magnetic escalation to eclipse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (stone's dent) constrains choice and charges closure—dent aligns with pulse during meditation, becomes "compass" in pocket; twilight's "bruised violets" evolve with auroras to flaring nexus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through magnetic surge and eclipse countdown, but "correlate silence" mechanism remains abstract; cost crystallizes in "too late... just in time" line yet lacks tangible trade-off beyond conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through chess/silence correlation—"beauty blooms in soil of difficulty" earned by pupils' memories—avoiding moralizing; final "silent symphony" image resonates without stating moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: "bruised violets," "tactile anchor," chess lexicon; stress compresses diction to "He correlated—not to predict, but to perceive"; no head-hopping, rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in "forces older than crowns, older than exile" strains rhythm; otherwise zero loops, high density—final line "one correlated step" ties motif with propulsion; no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess strategy with cosmic resonance; "correlate silence" transforms exile into exploration with emotional specificity; risk-taking elevates stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
