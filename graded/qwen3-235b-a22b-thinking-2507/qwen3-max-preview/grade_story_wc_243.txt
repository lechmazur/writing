<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority crystallizes through embodied micro-choices (not weeping to preserve ink, smiling at memory of laugh); contradictory impulses act simultaneously in the covenant clauses that both mourn and affirm. Final renunciation of grand gestures for "ink-stained stitch" work earns closure with salt-stung cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: "regenerated covenant" shifts from shattered abstraction to embodied practice via proximate causes (locket click, child's laugh). Cost is undeniable in "tears would blur the ink" restraint and the archivist's lifelong commitment to "steep the ordinary in reverence" against cultural erasure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Jetty setting actively constrains choices (kneeling on salt-crusted planks, tide timing) and charges closure: lanterns become "fireflies" against darkening sky as the archivist walks home, reconfiguring the marsh's loss through tactile continuity. Walnut ink's forest/ending scent embodies thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: preserving "small eternal weights" against cultural amnesia culminates in writing covenant clauses that reframe loss as active resistance. Cost crystallizes in the unshed tears and the quiet realization that regeneration requires "breath by breath" labor—no empire can erase but no victory is final.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: locket photo's "stubborn light," tea-steam confessions, and proximate causes like "stranger returning a lost glove." Final image rejects moralizing by showing covenant regeneration as "walking home beneath a sky just beginning to star"—resonant answer to cultural erasure without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters twilight through archivist's purpose: "jasmine that curled through cracks" mirrors cultural resilience; ink "smelled of forests and endings" embodies her work. Rhythmic control under pressure in "Each word was a stone laid in a bridge between then and now" avoids lyric excess through tactile precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "steep the memory in metaphor" simultaneously advances plot, character, and theme. One borderline abstraction ("stubborn luminescence of love") redeemed by immediate concrete anchor ("silver grain"). Final line’s "sky just beginning to star" recharges opening twilight with earned hope.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms archivist trope through specific, lived detail: walnut ink as vessel for sorrow/joy, covenant clauses rooted in "hospital vigils" and "birthday candles blown out too soon." Emotional specificity in "we will carry each other’s silences, not as burdens, but as altars" avoids generic sentimentality.</comment>
