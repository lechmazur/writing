<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prince’s embodied exhaustion ("trembling fingers cradled the egg") and contradictory hope/despair drive every choice; micro-decisions like calibrating pendulums reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Only minor deduction for slightly underdeveloped internal contradiction beyond core motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "beauty had stirred" crystallizes stakes with visceral cost ("years of despair shaking loose"). Causal lens holds flawlessly from hypothesizing to activation, with "acid rain" establishing early stakes paid off in the breeze’s scent. No deductions—cost is unmistakable in the trembling palace and tears.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Suspended palace actively constrains choices (working amid "cracked marble floors") and charges the final image: "mineral tears" motif evolves into the "breeze carrying wild thyme," proving environment shapes the climax. Every detail serves pressure—no ornamental description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally through prince’s agency: installing "copper veins," calibrating heartbeats, culminating in the palm press. Cost is visceral—"acid rain," "bureaucrats’ laughter"—paid in endurance. Only deduction: bureaucrats’ opposition isn’t tested in the climax beat itself, slightly diluting pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the dandelion moment ("beauty was oxygen"), avoiding moralizing. Ending’s "bitterly sweet" chirp and wild thyme breeze offer resonant, non-literal answer to "reawakening beauty." No thematic echo—the "oxygen" line is earned through scene, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: prince notices "mineral tears" and "chromatic pulses" reflecting obsession. Rhythm modulates perfectly under stress ("Not from the egg. Not yet." vs. lyrical hatching description). Only hairline slip: "marrow of his marrow" slightly exceeds his stressed lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "crown dented like a crushed beetle shell" does triple duty for character, tone, and propulsion. Figurative language stays precise ("honey laced with salt" justified by egg’s duality). Deduction solely for the familiar "honey/salt" simile in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms rebirth trope via specific mechanics: "gears for elegance," "pendulums mimicking heartbeats." Emotional truth in "he did not know if it would hatch tomorrow." Avoids sentimentality with "bitterly sweet" tone. Slight deduction for mechanical wasteland’s partial familiarity.</comment>
