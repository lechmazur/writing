<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—playing to unbind yet accepting incompleteness—drive her micro-choices (e.g., the child’s petal placement), with embodied emotion in "tears glistening—not from grief, but awe." Motivation avoids redemption tropes, rooted in inherited creed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the still bowl and floating petal reconfigure options with visceral cost ("the chronic hush holds its breath"). Accumulative lens holds throughout; orientation anchors by word 20 ("sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The mendicant’s bowl constrains every choice—mapping vibrations, reflecting firelight—and charges the final image (petal floating, "it does not sink"). Shipwrecks and greenhouse pressure tactics via creaks and rust, avoiding symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lira’s agency: her playing narrows options to "unbind the beauty coiled in the incomplete," with felt cost in the deepening hush. Escalation via density (vines stirring, hatch creaking) reweights the dominant stake under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the bowl’s evolving resonance and scorched petal, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "unfinished" as active hope ("it does not sink"), offering non-literal answer to the central question without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("acoustically perceptive") shapes rhythm: short phrases for tension ("The note trembles outward"), lyrical flow for reflection. No head-hopping; voice modulates under pressure ("a held note, soft as breath").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("ghost of song—unfinished, aching, alive") with propulsion. Minor overwriting in "motes of ash still suspended," but closure image ("petal... floats. It does not sink") avoids figurative muddle, sharpening cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synthesizes music/ecology tropes through specific, grounded choices (teak violin, rainwater bowl). Fresh inflection in "chronic hush" as active pressure, not passive backdrop. Avoids safety-middle via unflinching focus on fragility.</comment>
