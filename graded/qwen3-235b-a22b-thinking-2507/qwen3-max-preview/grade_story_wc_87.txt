<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied action ("couldn't steer her own pulse") and micro-choices (naming poles as waypoints). Final shift to "imperfect motion" earned by prior pole navigation, with visible cost ("wasn't healed... but was moving"). No therapy-speak, only visceral metaphors like "regret had magnetized the air".</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "backlash of regrets hadn't vanished—it had simply lost its grip". Accumulative lens holds through pole-by-pole progression, with persistent constraint (broken compass) shaping tactics. Orientation flawless within 40 words ("coastal kayak launch").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Utility poles function as micro-setting that constrains choice (navigating inland) and charges final image ("poles receded... stars emerged"). Compass evolves from useless heirloom to "witness," reweighting meaning at closure. Sensory details reflect urgency ("crows settling on crossarms" during calm).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (aligning heart/action) tightens through pole navigation's tangible cost ("weeks pinned to launch ramp"). Agency drives escalation: choosing poles over stars forecloses old identity. Cost unmistakable in "wasn't healed... but was moving," reconfigured by final paddle strokes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: compass needle pointing "toward her stern" reweights "direction could be chosen, not inherited." Final image ("she was becoming") offers resonant answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by embedding insight in action ("navigate by what remained").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is character-particular ("utility poles marching inland," "crows settling on crossarms"). Rhythmic control under pressure: "merrily melancholic" compresses emotional contradiction. Zero head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early ("salt wind tangling her hair like unresolved equations").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence multiplies meaning ("compass weighed heavy... fogged with breath and brine"). Figurative language intensifies pressure without muddle ("regret had magnetized the air"). Final line’s cadence ("beneath a sky that remembered how to hold her") charges closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "broken protagonist" trope via utility pole navigation—a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking (elevating mundane poles to stars) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth anchors universals ("wasn't fixed. But she was moving").</comment>
