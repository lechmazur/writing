<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elira’s motivation to "decode the message in falling leaves" manifests through concrete micro-choices (prodding specks with fern-tip stylus, embedding them in monuments), but the grandmother’s knowledge-transfer borders on abstract insight without sufficient embodied struggle during the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the grandmother’s emergence crystallizes options with undeniable cost ("knowledge flooded her—not as data, but as scent, texture, song"), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first leaf-fall to final whisper.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The arbor actively constrains choices—dust-specks only activate through reverence, and the final "tiny towers of twig and dew" directly charge closure by transforming forgotten things into living memorials; micro-setting (dew-cradled bark crevices) enables pivotal speck-gathering.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen organically from leaf-interpretation to active memory-retrieval; Elira’s agency in altering monuments narrows options, with cost legible in "tears touched earth" blooming moss—a visible tradeoff that reshapes her world.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (building monuments), not abstraction; the grandmother’s "You sorted silence" crystallizes the core question without moralizing, and the final sanctuary image offers a resonant non-literal answer to honoring the past.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("mossy delight," ledger noting "velocity, curl") and rhythmic control shine under pressure; sentences compress during speck-discovery ("She didn’t scoop it; she prodded"), modulating voice to mirror emotional intensity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line multi-tasks ("leaves spiraling downward not with decay, but coded rhythm" establishes setting/conflict/theme); final line’s rhythmic cadence ("each one carries a whisper. And she, transformed always, listens") achieves closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms folklore through specific mechanics (dust-speck activation via humming) and "sorting silence" reframing memory work; the risk of making the arbor itself the memory-keeper feels inevitable in hindsight, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
