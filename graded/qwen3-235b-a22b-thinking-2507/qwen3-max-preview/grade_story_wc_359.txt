<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via synesthetic specificity ("taste the G-minor as burnt caramel"), but motivation lacks tangible conflict—wonder's "brittleness" remains abstract without embodied cost. Micro-choices under pressure (mallet strikes guided by aurora) feel earned, yet the final renunciation lacks visceral stakes beyond thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: "wonder had been certified—not as luxury, but as oxygen" reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory escalation, but the felt cost remains oblique—no concrete forfeiture beyond spiritual endurance, narrowly missing 9.0+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ice cavern actively constrains choices (bell strikes altering ice structure) and charges closure: "every footstep chimed" proves environment as essential pressure. Micro-setting (amber sheet, prism-bell) evolves causally, with quartz veins revealed through sound—environment directly shapes the final image's charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certifying wonder) tightens through sensory escalation, but opposition ("cities trading silence for sirens") stays abstract. Pressure coheres via aurora-guided strikes, yet the cost remains conceptual—no tangible loss (e.g., physical toll, sacrificed opportunity)—weakening the escalation's visceral impact despite lyrical precision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "wonder as oxygen" crystallizes in closure without moralizing. The final image ("sculpted hush inside her") reweights wonder's necessity through action, avoiding abstraction. No thematic echo—insight arises from "child’s laughter thawed by harmonic resonance," not exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("breath curling like spectral notation") modulates under pressure—syntax tightens during strikes ("She raised her mallet..."). Synesthetic lexicon ("cerulean resonance") stays character-bound; no head-hopping. Rhythmic control peaks in closure: "carrying the sculpted hush inside her" embodies earned transformation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but "synesthetically blessed" risks label-speak (mitigated by immediate embodiment). Figurative density stays purposeful ("frozen chandeliers"), though "sculpted hush" verge on abstraction. Final line’s propulsion ("walked on—certifier, sculptor, bell ringer") achieves crystalline closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms artist-as-savior trope via synesthetic mechanics: "unfettering" notes as tangible acts (ice cracking to reveal quartz). Emotional truth in "wonder becomes brittle" avoids cliché. Risk-taking (sensory translation as conflict) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though the premise edges near mythic archetypes.</comment>
