<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "playing absence into presence" and embodied pressure behind ribs; grandmother's wisdom earns final renunciation. Slight underdevelopment of prophecy's personal cost prevents 9.0 despite strong micro-choices like embouchure shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: dripping water's "slower, gentler" rhythm embodies the grotto's exhaustion. Lens (Accumulative) holds through fog thickening and dewdrop acceleration, though prophecy dissolution feels slightly too clean for maximum cost proof.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Saxophone constrains every choice and charges closure ("mouthpiece damp with mist's surrender"); prism's shattering reweights the recurring dewdrop motif. Sensory hierarchy masterfully narrows under pressure—condensation becomes tactical resource during climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by protagonist's agency: softening attack and playing "absence" directly narrow options as fog swallows light. Stakes crystallize through physical cost—the grotto's "exhale" and altered water rhythm make conceptual cost undeniable under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final dewdrop holding "only memory of light" offers resonant non-literal answer to silencing prophecies, avoiding moralizing. Theme emerges through action ("hush them with beauty") with complexity in "some silences must never be broken," no thematic echo despite grandmother's line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in sound-as-texture metaphors ("notes curling like smoke around silence"); rhythm compresses under stress ("He shifted his embouchure..."). Zero head-hopping, with fog/mist lexicon perfectly calibrated to saxophonist's embodied expertise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "shattered—not with noise, but with a sigh of light" demonstrates peak-beat clarity. Figurative language serves pressure ("fog thickened... swirling like ink in milk") without muddle. Final line recharges opening with devastating precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms prophecy trope through "hushing" as active verb and saxophone-as-weapon; emotional specificity in generational trauma avoids cliché. Risk-taking with accumulative structure pays off via prism/dewdrop synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
