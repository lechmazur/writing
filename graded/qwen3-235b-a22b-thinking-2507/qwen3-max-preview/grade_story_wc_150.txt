<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—rebuilding faith through fragments, not treasure—is embodied in micro-choices like following scent/glint/echo. Contradictory impulses (reverence vs. demand) drive her excavation, earning the closure choice to stay. Slight abstraction in "faith, like the sundial" risks epiphany overreach but is redeemed by concrete actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): villagers' arrival crystallizes restored communal rhythm with undeniable conceptual cost ("dust and doubt" to "reawakened pulse"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—pressure tightens via artifact density (locket, toy) toward the sundial’s realignment, where cost is legible in "spiritual dislocation" healed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard constrains every choice: roots guide her "purposeful wandering," bones supply story context, and the final petal spiral charges closure. Micro-setting (sundial base) alters tactics—realizing displacement forces reorientation. "Roots curled around wrists—not to hinder, but to steady" exemplifies environment shaping action without symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes (restoring communal faith vs. spiritual dislocation) deepen via Elara’s excavation—each artifact reweights options, narrowing to the sundial’s reassembly. Agency is endurance: her "cautious enchantment" forecloses demand, with cost legible in the shift from "dust and doubt" to villagers bringing "seeds, candles, and songs" as earned consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely from concrete particulars: "faith... a rhythm to tend" is earned through Elara’s trowel work, not stated. Final image ("sundial whispered of resilience") answers the central question non-literally, reweighting "interrupted journeys" into rooted renewal. Avoids moralizing; complexity lies in faith as active tending, not passive preservation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: "warmly curious gaze," soil under nails, "scent of damp loam" as navigation. Rhythm modulates under pressure—lyrical cadence ("petals fell upward") shifts to taut action during excavation. Zero head-hopping; voice stays rooted in Elara’s embodied curiosity without abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "gnarled roots threading between femurs... like fingers reclaiming forgotten prayers." Figurative language charges pressure (upward petals = magic’s shyness) without muddle. Final line’s "time itself learned to bloom again" avoids cliché through concrete roots/bones entwined imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms diaspora trope via "catacomb orchard" setting and "purposeful wandering" method—faith as "rhythm to tend" feels inevitable. Risk-taking (magic in bones, upward petals) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh inflection: spiritual dislocation mirrored in sundial’s displacement, not abstract loss.</comment>
