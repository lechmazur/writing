<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority leans on abstract phrasing ("jaded wonder," "hollow might fill") without embodied contradiction; empathy spark feels asserted rather than earned through conflicting impulses during the ripple visions. Diagnostic label "empathy, kindled" in climax triggers penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis succeeds (releasing baseball, turning climbward) with conceptual cost, but cost proof is thin—the chest tightening lacks visceral specificity to anchor the sacrifice. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds cleanly through the fractal ripples' reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Bioluminescent lake charges the climax via fractal ripples illuminating submerged artifacts, yet setting remains atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choice; micro-setting (baseball) matters more. Final image’s "glowing, quiet... alive" avoids overt symbolism but misses 9+ gate’s requirement for environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes (kindling empathy) tighten through the baseball’s release, but escalation lacks tangible cost—emotional shift ("raw, aching proximity") feels conceptual rather than viscerally paid. Agency is present but the lake’s magical response weakens causal pressure under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars: the floating baseball’s fractal ripples reweight "paths not taken" into empathy’s spark. Final line ("fiercely alive in the dark") offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though "glowing" edges toward sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in details like "classified ads hid coordinates" and "air tasted of ozone," but voice stays uniformly poetic under stress without rhythmic modulation. Dialogue carries subtext ("read the silence between them"), though Kael’s lines verge on thematic exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor density issues: "vessel scrubbed raw, yet haunted by residue" overlaps abstraction; final paragraph’s "fiercely alive" risks purple prose. No fatal loops, but scaffold lingers in reflection ("Their journey hadn’t begun with steps...") without altering present tactics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-erasure trope via "labyrinth of ink," but underground lake setting echoes cyberpunk conventions. Risk-taking (lyric structure, Earned Stasis closure) heightens stakes coherently, though "clean slate" premise lacks full transformation beyond expected emotional arc.</comment>
