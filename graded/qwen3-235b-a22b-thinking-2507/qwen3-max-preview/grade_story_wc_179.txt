<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "pacifism required more cunning than war" yet she kneels powerless; embodied fury via "clenched jaw from childhood" avoids therapy-speak. Final release earned through cellular memory micro-choice, though secondary characters remain conceptual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "melody had migrated" crystallizes shifting grace with undeniable cost ("resentment cannot be argued away"). Accumulative lens holds through reality’s dissolve; one tightening (broken pin → marrow hum) suffices for 800 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: music box pin constrains every choice, charging the final image where "relic of surrender" rests on moss. Sensory hierarchy narrows under pressure ("palms flat against cold marble" → "warmth bloomed beneath her fingers").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: broken pin forces cellular memory deepening. Cost legible in "hollow chest from abandonment" becoming "presence resonated," but physical toll remains abstract. One decisive deepening elevates stakes beyond "rage into rhythm."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pin’s reprise: "re-membering—putting the self back together" answers "how to release resentment" without moralizing. Final image ("box on moss where rage was left") reweights pacifism as active surrender, avoiding false binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "body’s quiet archive" and "listen with sinew," though "hollowed lovers" slightly breaks lexicon. Rhythmic control peaks in "Not peace. Not rest. Just absence," but passive constructions dilute immediacy during climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "ghost of a chime" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Mild register drift: "sinew" feels clinical mid-catharsis. Final line’s "humming" avoids overwriting, but "cellular memory" risks thematic echo without concrete embodiment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Scheming pacifist" transformed via physiological specificity ("stiff shoulders from betrayal"). Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off, though music-box trope lacks fresh inflection. Emotional truth anchors universality without genericism.</comment>
