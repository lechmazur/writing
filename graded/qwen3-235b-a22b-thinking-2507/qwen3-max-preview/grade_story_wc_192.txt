<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete ("bare feet whispering over charcoal dust") but lacks contradictory impulses; final choice feels inevitable rather than contested. "Burns bridges carefully" refrain elevates motivation yet remains thematic rather than driving micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "suffocation ends not when air returns..." crystallizes cost through visceral physiology ("shape of your own throat"). Accumulative lens holds as echoes intensify pressure toward dissolution, with starlight pooling as the decisive intensification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ashen charcoal dust constrains every movement (bare feet, stirred embers) and charges the final image ("hush of lungs remembering"). "Burnt sugar and old tears" sensory detail perfectly mirrors internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: meeting echoes with stillness forces the sanctuary's surrender. Cost is legible in "ribs learn to expand anyway," but escalation lacks one visible trade-off—her scars enable passage without immediate physical consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action ("permission to fumble in the dark"), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights suffocation as self-imposed constriction, with "shape of your own throat" offering resonant, non-literal resolution to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("starlight pooled thickest") with rhythmic control, though "linking through scars was her method—not metaphor, but mechanism" risks academic register. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates perfectly during threshold dissolution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops but minor overwriting: "each branded lesson from love’s collapse" feels thematic rather than character-driven. "Burnt sugar and old tears" borders on cliché yet redeems through context. Final line’s cadence flawlessly recharges "fumbling in the dark."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms bridge-burning trope through "tender shadow keeper" role—teaching suffocation to breathe via absence. Risk-taking (threshold as memory rather than physical barrier) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "unlit lanterns" image feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
