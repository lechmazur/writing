<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "methodically hopeful, never frantic" under pressure; final shared painting earns endurance with visible cost (solitude to connection) through prior glyph causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the girl's arrival crystallizes "you are not alone" with felt cost (painter's solitary mission now shared), proven by the barista's salt/jasmine-triggered compulsion three blocks away.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rooftop greenhouse constrains choice (canvas alignment with moon path) and charges closure; meteorite/chamomile ink's physicality shapes tactics, while saffron moonlight reweights the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through glyph transmissions' escalating impact, but the barista's coffee gift lacks sufficient cost escalation; pressure coheres via moonlight density until the girl's arrival forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete glyphs ("hand that gives water") and dandelion offerings; final image reweights "not alone" without moralizing, though "kindness was the signature" borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "silence pooled like spilled ink" and meteorite ink details; rhythmic control under stress ("methodically hopeful, never frantic") with intentional lyric compression paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops in peak beats; meteorite/chamomile ink shows high density. Minor paraphrase loop in "never frantic, never despairing" costs 0.3, but saffron moonlight charges final image without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lost-language glyphs transform "art heals society" trope through specific Vaelish/Sky-Weavers mechanics; emotional truth in mismatched socks offerings avoids generic templates despite familiar premise.</comment>
