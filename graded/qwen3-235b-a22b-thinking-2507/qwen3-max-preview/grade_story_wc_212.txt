<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but lacks contradictory impulses; "furiously tranquil" shown via action yet no internal conflict tested under pressure. Final choice earned but micro-choices sparse beyond acorn cap handling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly; Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost (weeping ice, released moments) crystallizes entropy decrease. Orientation perfect in opening line; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Icebound atrium constrains every choice (barefoot cracks, upward-weeping droplets); final sapling image charged by recurring oak motif. Micro-setting (acorn cap ridges on sternum) directly enables closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving life's codes) tightens via single decisive action (planting cap); cost legible in dissolving eggshell and released moments. Agency clear though escalation subtle under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "borrowed time" texture reweighted by sapling’s childhood summers/forgiveness. Avoids moralizing; final image ("porous, alive" time) answers central question without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (marrow-humming vortex, ice as "shattered chandeliers"); rhythm modulates from trembling to "wild serenity." Zero head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; high density ("vibrating at the frequency where rage and peace fuse"). "Weep" metaphor coherent throughout. Minor register drift in "entropy" jargon but voice-motivated and consistent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seed-saving with entropy physics; "texture of borrowed time" feels inevitable. Risks poetic abstraction but earns emotional truth through concrete stakes (Ghostroot Turnip names, thawing earth).</comment>
