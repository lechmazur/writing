<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (detached professionalism vs visceral investment in Varga's patch) manifest in the final action of stepping into the wind's path. Embodied cost is legible through physical details like the "sudden chill" and "collar tugging," avoiding abstract epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: "I stepped into its path. Let it learn me too" crystallizes the investigator's stance with undeniable physical cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through wind pattern accumulation, with Junction 7's impossible readings narrowing options decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The container labyrinth actively constrains choices (Junction 7 measurements, crane repositioning consequences). Varga's patch functions as micro-setting that charges the final image ("pressed against my ribs like a compass needle"), meeting the 9+ gate for environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pressure tightens through the investigator's agency: Junction 7's wind anomalies force sensor placement under the "six hours before sunset" deadline. The cost—implied physical danger in facing the wind—is visceral and legible in the final action, satisfying escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "the wind learns" reweights from Varga's dismissed transmission to the investigator's embodied stance. The final image answers the central question without moralizing, avoiding abstraction through sensory specificity ("tasting the air," "sudden chill").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("wind gauge," "thermal updraft") reflects the investigator's physics-trained mind. Rhythmic control modulates under pressure (short sentences during wind spikes: "Zero. Five seconds later, a 22-knot surge"), with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "The crane had been repositioned after Varga’s crash. They thought they were fixing the problem. They’d only changed its shape" demonstrates triple-duty syntax. Minor abstraction ("weighed more than it should") in high-pressure beat prevents 10.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms accident investigation through specific physics ("thermal differentials," "pressure gradients"). "Wind learns" is a fresh inflection that grows from container dynamics, avoiding tropes. Bold Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
