<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction absent; Elara's flawless execution lacks meaningful struggle despite "decisively kind" trait. Embodied emotions shine in humming hospital sounds but no authentic crisis degrades perception. Micro-choices like honoring vinyl breakage reveal values, yet moral ambiguity remains untested under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: vinyl dissolution seeds "earthly grace" echoes while Elara listens to rising hymns. Cost is visceral in the shard's golden filament sealing—sacrificing her instrument for connection. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds as scent-thickening reweights hope's conceptual cost without causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The vinyl shard constrains every choice—cradling it, humming through grooves, its dissolution charging the final image. Sensory specificity ("squeak of wheelchair brake," "honey on warm toast") filters through Elara's music-therapist bias, making micro-setting essential. Final scent-as-taste detail elevates closure beyond vivid description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via scent density: "thickened" hope becomes "tasted," narrowing Elara's mission from singing to dissolving. Pressure tightens through auditory accumulation (IV drips → teacup clinks → lullabies), yet agency lacks escalation—no live option foreclosed until vinyl dissolves. Cost legibility in final image saves from mid-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through mundane hymns reweighting "brokenness" as sacred: "reunification was not about wholeness restored, but connection honored." Final image answers central question—"flawless goodbye" becomes "quiet hum of a world made whole through gentle fractures"—without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality via pill bottles/oxygen masks specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in music-therapist lexicon ("syncopated farewell waltz," "cadence of IV drips"). Rhythmic control shifts from lyrical dawn ("crisp as mountain air") to staccato hospital sounds under pressure. Zero head-hopping; voice modulates seamlessly as vinyl dissolves into "motes of light" carrying melody fragments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "clink of teacup set down too hard" compresses action/image. Figurative language ("fragile, luminous, undeniable" for hope) serves accumulative lens without muddle. Final line—"ordinary and eternal, above the clouds"—resolves stakes through concrete action (listening) not abstraction. Slight overwriting in dawn description avoids penalty via payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms hospice tropes via "hymning the mundane"—IV drips as waltz, pill bottles as melody. Fresh inflection in vinyl shard dissolving into "earthly grace" echoes. Avoids abstraction through "zippers closing coats" specificity. Risk-taking (Accumulative lens for afterlife) heightens emotional truth without gimmickry; closure's quiet hum feels inevitable.</comment>
