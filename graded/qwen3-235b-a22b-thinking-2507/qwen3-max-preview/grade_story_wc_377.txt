<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concretely embodied in micro-choices (palming ice, storm adjustments), but contradictory impulses lack sufficient friction in pivotal moments; final renunciation earned yet internal conflict remains subtly underdeveloped despite strong seasonal muteness framework.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as sculpture persists without her—cost legible in "she did not leave instructions" and echoing figures—under Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation crystallizes by 100 words with "whispering bluff above the clouds" anchoring all three axes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Iceberg fragment constrains choices (calibrating strikes to atmospheric pressure) and charges final image ("glistened on cue"); micro-setting functions as environment through wind-driven mechanics that alter tuning tactics during storms.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through atmospheric pressure harmonization ("turning chaos into cadence"), with child interaction crystallizing the cost of wonder's fragility; agency manifests as endurance where renunciation (stopping climbs) forecloses her physical presence with felt consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image ("tuning a silence only wonder could fill") reweights "color of wonder" theme without moralizing, emerging from concrete particulars like the child's "full-body tremor" rather than abstract assertion; ambiguity lingers in "echo" figures.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "palms reading cliffside like braille" and kinetic urgency during storms; rhythmic control modulates with pressure through cadence shifts ("dawn’s blush and twilight’s sigh" to "prismatic shadows that danced like children").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; high density in "each shimmer a stanza in the ballad of vanishing cold" where metaphor serves physics and theme; final line’s resonance avoids figurative muddle despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms "last guardian" trope through glacial memory physics and muteness as precision; emotional specificity in "smile with shoulders" avoids generic templates while risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
