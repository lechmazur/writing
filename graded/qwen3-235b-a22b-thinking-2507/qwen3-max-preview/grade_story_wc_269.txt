<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in tactile ritual ("three taps for loss") avoids stock grief; embodied contradiction in "grieving yet growing" state earned by submersible descent. Minor deduction: limited exploration of competing impulses beyond core motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options ("anchored yet adrift") with felt cost in "metamorphoses" realization. Causal lens holds through CALYPSO’s 17-second delay driving diagnostics. No soft resets—revelation reconfigures prior loss without erasing it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sea station constrains choices (breached sensors forcing wading) and charges closure via humming console response. Micro-setting of tapping surfaces becomes the coral’s "radar," with "frayed nerve endings" on atlas merging environment and embodiment flawlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why paths vanish) tightens when 17-second delay forecloses old search method, forcing submersible dive. Cost legible in "grieving yet growing" stance, though abstract stakes could feel more visceral pre-revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Some losses aren’t endings. They’re metamorphoses" emerges from coral’s dormancy, not moralizing. Final image of "tactile cartography" reweights grief as active listening—no thematic echo, only earned resonance through bioluminescent pulses.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "edges frayed like nerve endings" filters setting through scientist’s tactile lens. Rhythm mirrors tapping ritual ("tap-tap-tap… pause…"), with compression during storm surge heightening pressure without muddying causality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "17 seconds" repetition serves causal function. "Anchored yet adrift" finale achieves maximum density—no scaffold, no overwriting. Minor deduction: "metamorphoses" slightly abstract but redeemed by coral’s physical pulse.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms climate grief via "periodically eternal" coral—fresh synthesis of adaptation science and tactile epistemology. Risk-taking (tapping as radar) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "drifting moored" tone avoids doom porn through earned wonder.</comment>
