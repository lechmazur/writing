<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority vividly concrete ("sardonic shell shed," "voice cracking like old floorboards"), but molting trait remains thematic label without constraining key choices—cost of transformation feels earned yet lacks physiological specificity during pivotal seed-planting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: candle burning amid sirens crystallizes "blooming resistance" with conceptual cost (Elias’s transfer), while moonlit seed-planting reconfigures stakes under Accumulative lens—orientation clear by paragraph one, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Library’s "cracks between floorboards" directly enable seed-planting climax, charging the final image; however, "shattered skylight" detail, while atmospheric, lacks causal pressure on tactics despite strong sensory integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (beauty in anarchy) tightens meaningfully as Molt shifts from reading to planting seeds, with Elias’s transfer raising stakes; internal conflict (cynicism vs hope) lacks sufficient contradictory impulses during climax despite clear conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete acts (pinning poems, pressing seeds), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "broken/seeds" without stating moral, though Elias’s "burn a mind" line risks thematic echo despite dialogue context.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("wax pooled like liquid starlight," "boots crunching brittle leaves") modulates perfectly under pressure—shorter sentences during seed-planting heighten urgency; no register drift despite lyrical density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but "felt the old skin of cynicism peel away" uses cliché phrasing that slightly dulls the climax image; otherwise impeccable rhythm and specificity ("charcoal on torn laundry list") drive momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms prison-librarian trope through gritty specifics (whiskey toast, coneflower seeds); "vagrant penny poet" avoids romanticization via coffee-tin pragmatism, though molting concept leans slightly familiar without deeper causal integration.</comment>
