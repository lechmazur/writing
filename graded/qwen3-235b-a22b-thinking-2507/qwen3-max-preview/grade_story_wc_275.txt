<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in sheathing knife ritual—gentleness chosen against violence—but lacks visible struggle against inherited brutality; micro-choices under pressure (e.g., seed wrap) earn stakes without over-tidying.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes cost in "ballast for the soul" and the girl’s departing step; Accumulative lens holds via density increase in sandbag motifs reweighting continuity; cost legible in "weight of choosing gentleness."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glass dome and ballast sandbag constrain choices (salvaged planter lining, seed wrap) and charge final image; micro-setting specificity—sand’s "grit clinging like stubborn memory"—directly shapes Elara’s grounding ritual and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (gentleness vs. brutality) tightens through visitor’s challenge, but escalation lacks visceral cost escalation; "weight" felt conceptually yet physical stakes remain abstract, limiting pressure depth despite coherent Accumulative escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image of girl with "dirt under her nails" offers non-literal answer to "can plants remember people?" without moralizing; theme emerges through rose-cutting ritual, avoiding Thematic Echo despite "Continuity" speech’s near-miss in dialogue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("tremor in a petal before wind") and rhythmic cadence ("liquid gold, bathing the farm in tranquil blaze") modulate flawlessly under pressure; no head-hopping, voice consistent in reflection and dialogue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but "senselessly perceptive—not in the way..." contains explanatory scaffold; high density maintained except minor paraphrase loop in "engraved quiet" repetition, barely dulling closure’s charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" synthesizes apocalyptic hope with fresh specificity; risk-taking (Accumulative structure, quiet closure) heightens coherence, though bounty hunter trope transformation lacks one deeper, unexpected inflection for 9+.</comment>
