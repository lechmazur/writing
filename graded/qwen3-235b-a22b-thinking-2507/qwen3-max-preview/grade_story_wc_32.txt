<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak through embodied details ("bruised violet of twilight skies," "fingers brushing cracked obsidian"), but the final renunciation lacks visceral cost escalation beyond conceptual shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost ("stifling destiny unraveled by friction"), holding Accumulative/Textural lens through sensory accumulation to the final ember flare as affirmation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ember nexus functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (powdered moonstone circle) and charges the final image (portable nexus), with sensory details filtered through alchemist’s tactile urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist’s iterative actions ("Too sharp... Too slow"), but the dominant stake (suffocation vs. creation) lacks a concrete on-page price beyond psychological reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "creative destruction" evolving into "deconstruction," crystallized by the crozier’s rebirth—no moralizing, just the "frozen bloom" melting into "singing" light reweighting prior struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("heat still whispered beneath cooled crusts"), with rhythmic control in high-pressure beats ("iterate, fail, adapt, repeat"), though reflection stays within BRR limits without micro-choice tilts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in closure beats, but "bruised violet of twilight skies" edges toward stock imagery; otherwise, syntax varies purposefully with scene intensity ("frost bloomed... petals of frozen bloom").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms alchemy tropes through "successive approximation" mechanics; the crozier’s rebirth as "twin voids swirling with ember-light" synthesizes specificity, risk, and earned conceptual freshness.</comment>
