<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vendor's contradictory impulses ("unwrite herself" while selling measured erasure) manifest in ritualistic micro-choices (incising marks, ledger entries). Final endurance—distributing her burden through others' hollows—earns visible cost via ledger's "3.7 heartbeats of regret" quantification.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: vendor packs cart leaving ledger open, seven glimmers dancing with "stories begun elsewhere." Conceptual cost crystallizes in ledger's "ghost of arithmetic," while Accumulative lens holds through ritual escalation (7 sales deepening her stance).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bottled moonlight functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (must be used "beneath a forgotten tree") and charges closure: "seven glimmers danced above her" reweights the final image with "raw material she sought," avoiding overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by vendor's agency: seven quantified sales narrow options toward distributing her burden. Cost unmistakable in ledger's "12 grams of unsaid words" and her realization that weight distribution—not reduction—brings lightness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Ending offers resonant answer: "Choose your emptiness... shape of your next beginning" reweights absence as foundation without moralizing. Theme emerges through concrete sales, not abstraction, with "hollows left behind" resisting tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "fingers, mindfully scattered" and "wind carried half-sentences like fallen leaves." Rhythmic fragments ("None fit. None lasted.") heighten pressure; dialogue subtext ("quantifying absence") avoids exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "prismatic shards that danced across the ceiling like startled birds" achieves high density without muddle. Final line recharges motifs with propulsion: "packed her cart, leaving the ledger open" avoids closure dilution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory commerce ("glimmering parole" as conditional release) avoids cliché through measurement-as-ritual. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes: "3.7 heartbeats of regret" makes emotional calculus visceral without abstraction.</comment>
