<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "fragility wasn't weakness; it was the first draft of resilience," but "tragically radiant" risks thematic label-speak despite strong embodied grief in rib-hollow resonance. Micro-choices like whispering the vow—not prayer—reveal values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands flawlessly: "completion. Not emptiness" crystallizes the cost of archiving over healing, with the shell's silence charging the final image. Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density tightens pressure toward sovereign endurance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The whispering seashell constrains every choice—mapping memories, structuring grief, becoming the archive node—charging the final image where it "hummed faintly, waiting." Velvet garden’s tactile presence (vines curling, moss cradling) shapes her kneeling endurance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: the seashell’s resonance forces confrontation with quarantined memories, narrowing options to archiving or dissolution. Cost is visceral in "dread pooling in her ribs" and the final surrender of the shell, reweighting isolation as sovereignty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "turning solitude into sovereignty" via archiving, not stated morals. Final image reweights the premise—"memories were safe... turned into a compass"—offering non-literal resolution to "translate isolation into independence" without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is immaculate: "petals that sighed like forgotten lullabies," "resonance structures inside her mind unfold." Rhythm modulates from meditative ("breath steady despite dread") to crystalline ("I remember you. I carry you.") under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "geometries of grief, lattices of longing" achieves high density without muddle. Final line’s "humming faintly, waiting" propels closure with layered meaning. Slight register drift in "resonance structures" saved by contextual integration into her mental scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms memory-archiving tropes through "resonance structures" as active translation—not passive recollection—and "fragility as first draft of resilience." Velvet garden’s ghostly resolve feels fresh, avoiding lyric clichés via tactile specificity (soil on knees, salt scent miles inland).</comment>
