<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses during climax; "chivalrous heart swelling with joy" leans saccharine. Motivation ("sacred playfulness") remains consistent but internal conflict never manifests physically—no hesitation when swapping the Black Queen despite rumored "sigh of a dying constellation." Micro-choices absent; execution flawless yet untested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "sky convulsed—purple bleeding into gold" reconfigures stakes with undeniable cost (world's near-fracture). Orientation clear by line 3 ("icebound spire above clouds"). Backstory ("three winters learning board language") exceeds BRR 20% but anchors to present micro-choice (swapping gambits that "sang like lullabies").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Icebound spire actively constrains choices: "frost-glazed stone" enables silent approach, "wind howling" masks movement. Pocket sundial lid functions as micro-setting—its "click shut" charges the final image. "Air tasted of static and snow" filters sensory detail through Elric’s urgency; no white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly: bruised sky → physical peril (numb fingers) → cosmic consequence (fractured heavens). Cost legible when "ice cracking like knuckles" during swaps. But stakes remain abstract—no personal sacrifice from Elric beyond effort. "Frozen rivers whispered awake" shows consequence but lacks visceral, character-specific price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "he had not fixed the sky—he had invited it to play" crystallizes without moralizing. "Apprentice of wonder" evolves from title to embodied philosophy via swaps (widow’s tear for comet’s breath). No thematic echo; ambiguity lingers in "sacred playfulness" versus cosmic responsibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "wind howled like a choir of forgotten gods," "breath sharp as glass." Zero filter verbs; pure immersion. Voice modulates under pressure—lyrical during swaps ("whispered apologies to old truths"), clipped during ascent ("fingers numb"). No head-hopping; single-POV mastery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in "heart drumming a rhythm older than kingdoms" during high-pressure beat. Otherwise pristine: "ice cracking like knuckles" achieves density, rhythm, and escalation in one image. Zero synonym loops; final line’s cadence ("stepping into the light, arms wide") resolves momentum perfectly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms heist tropes: thief as pilgrim, chess as cosmic repair. "Secrets inside pieces" avoids cliché through specificity (rebel’s unsung anthem). Derivative risk in "apprentice of wonder" naming, but execution feels fresh via tactile swaps. Emotional truth in surrender-as-victory.</comment>
