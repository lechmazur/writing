<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in generational trauma ("silence corrodes faster than ink"); micro-choices like telescope inversion reveal contradictory impulses (reverence/rebellion) under pressure. Final stance crystallizes with visible cost in "orbits are paths" realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "Orbits are not prisons. They are paths" reconfigures meaning while smoke imagery makes regret tangible. Hybrid lens (causal evidence-gathering + accumulative orbit motif) holds through final email.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory constrains choices (telescope modification, smoke observation); rosewood pen functions as micro-setting charging the finale ("weight a promise"). Sensory hierarchy perfect: brass coldness, wind whispers, smoldering city lights filter through her archival focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: timestamped evidence forces irreversible action. Cost is visceral in "dark thread stitching sky to earth, regret to reckoning"—conceptual price of truth-seeking made undeniable by the smoke pattern.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "Q.E.D." document embodies the non-literal answer to truth’s persistence. Avoids moralizing; "truth, like gravity, always finds its orbit" resonates through telescope mechanics without abstract declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless: "deciphering Braille left by vanished astronomers" shows occupation-filtered observation. Rhythmic control under pressure—staccato sentences ("She didn’t need them.") mirror tactical focus during evidence deployment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "smoldering like embers beneath a blanket of mist" avoids mixed metaphor. Propulsion peaks in evidence sequence: "photographed... emailed... proof by contradiction" uses syntactic urgency without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms journalism tropes through archival precision ("proof by contradiction" as method). Fresh synthesis: cosmic orbits reframed as psychological cycles, made specific by municipal archive smoke patterns and generational ink metaphors.</comment>
