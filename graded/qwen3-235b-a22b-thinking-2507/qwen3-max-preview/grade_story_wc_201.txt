<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority excels with embodied trauma ("knees locked when shadows moved wrong") and contradictory impulses (bracing vs. moving toward revelation). Final choice to offer the strap is earned through visceral causality, though "remembering through trauma" borders on diagnostic phrasing without sufficient immediate cost in one beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands flawlessly: mercy redefined as "a space to be inhabited" with visible cost (strap dissolving into light). Accumulative lens holds through trauma-density escalation, though orientation test waiver relies on disorientation serving closure—no penalty applied.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (violet ripples guide path) and charges closure (light dissolving strap). Strap's tactile presence elevates specificity, though "displaced, rooted world" slightly abstracts the final image without concrete cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes viscerally narrow through proprioceptive pressure ("pulse quickened from alignment with something older than torture"), but interrogation memories lack escalation depth—recursive questions feel static rather than compounding cost under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (strap offering) and final image ("woven into the roots"), avoiding moralizing. "Mercy is not an equation" crystallizes subtext perfectly, though "mathematics of mercy" risks abstraction before earned by forest symbols.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("bark that hummed with unseen frequencies"), but elevated diction ("proprioceptively enhanced") clashes with trauma-survivor lexicon in high-pressure beats, slightly undermining voice authenticity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts; "shores of needles" and "violet ripples spread like equations" achieve layered density without muddle. Minor overwriting risk in "geometry of suffering" is redeemed by payoff in forest mathematics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms trauma narrative via ultraviolet penance mechanics—forest responding to pain as relational calculus feels inevitable. Risk-taking in conceptual closure heightens stakes, though "enhanced interrogation" trope lacks fresh inflection beyond setting.</comment>
