<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lore keeper’s "wisely adventurous" trait drives key choices (peeling paint, trusting flake), but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses—no moment where hesitation wars with urgency beyond surface-level "not rushing, not hesitating." Final choice feels earned yet untested by genuine struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: throne fusion crystallizes cost (orchard vanishing) and reweights the premise—"comprehension" over possession. Sunrise deadline tightens options causally, though temporal fraying near climax lacks visceral escalation of personal stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orchard’s temporal veil pressures tactics (sunrise countdown), but micro-setting (weeping willow’s starlight droplets) doesn’t constrain choices—it merely guides. Final image (city towers humming like the flake) charges closure, yet environment rarely shapes *how* she acts beyond time pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally as sunrise approaches (stairway fraying), but the "fools shatter" lore remains theoretical—no moment tests her against recursive echoes. Cost (orchard’s pixel-collapse) is visible yet emotionally detached, lacking deeper sacrifice beyond lost access.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: throne’s "perspective" revelation reweights "ascent" without moralizing. Final image—"memory of stairways" and "wisdom and adventure walk hand in hand"—resonantly answers the central question while charging prior motifs with earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("moss whispering ancestral names," "temporal eddies") shines under pressure. Minor register drift: "sally forth" feels archaic for urgency, but rhythmic control elevates the climax ("She sat. The ruby flake fused...").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion ("Kneeling, she brushed aside glowing petals and unearthed...") with zero loops. One hairline slip: "moved wisely adventurous" slightly jars syntax, but density and closure clarity remain uncompromised.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory as physical space (stairway of "frozen moments") avoids nostalgia tropes. Risk-taking heightens stakes—the throne’s non-power revelation transforms "ascent" into emotional truth, feeling inevitable yet surprising.</comment>
