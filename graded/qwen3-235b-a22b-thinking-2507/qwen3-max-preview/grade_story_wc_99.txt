<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction manifests in Elio’s methodical ritual versus the emotional turbulence he channels; micro-choices like tracing lace stitches reveal hierarchy of values. Final realization ("apologies don’t need voices") earned through tactile actions, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: compass stilling and diffused regret reconfigure emotional stakes with conceptual cost ("lighter now, rinsed clean"). Accumulative lens holds, though cost legibility slightly abstract in "cerulean regret" phrasing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Islet’s rain pool and wind actively constrain choices (mirror for ritual, breeze diffusing color); micro-setting (soil, lace) charges final image. "Cerulean regret" specificity avoids cliché, with sensory hierarchy reflecting Elio’s focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elio’s agency: compass needle’s vibration to soil darkening shows escalating emotional density. Conceptual cost ("redistributed weight") unmistakable in islet’s sigh, though physical manifestation slightly overshadows internal tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through lace instructions and color gradients; "dawn after storm" leaves reprise stakes without moralizing. Final image resonates as non-literal answer to "unspoken apologies," avoiding thematic echo despite whispered line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in texture-focused lexicon ("silt settling," "unspun silk"); rhythm modulates with ritual intensity. Zero head-hopping, with compression taught early ("Severance" backstory anchored by compass).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "bruised indigo bleeding upward" exemplifies high-density propulsion. One borderline dense phrase ("chromatic echo of words swallowed before they could bloom") slightly muddles but pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bonsai artistry and emotional archaeology avoids abstraction; "teal where grief aged" specificity transforms tropes. Risk-taking (lyric ritual) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though Severance backstory edges toward vagueness.</comment>
