<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Revolutionary’s embodied grief ("rosary of regrets") and micro-choices (covering mirrors) reveal contradictory impulses; final renunciation of triumph for translation feels earned through tactile pressure of the shard. Voss’s late arrival slightly undermines relationship-as-crucible depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: "reimagining civilization as a living question" reweights revolution’s purpose with felt cost ("wept not for loss, but for possibility"). Orientation anchors by word 15; Accumulative lens holds through glyph revelation’s cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid’s micro-setting (crystal shard) charges closure: refracted glyphs become the lost society’s blueprint. Time-streams and chrono-winds actively constrain choices (mirror covering), avoiding postcard description through causal pressure on decoding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Archaeological dispute tightens via shard’s glyph revelation, forcing revolutionary to abandon "wrong war" for memory rebellion. Stakes deepen through mirror method’s cost (velvet drapes during storms), though Voss’s arrival slightly eases pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final haiku ("We are the answer") reweights revolution as anti-forgetting without moralizing. Theme emerges from concrete acts: shared silence as wealth, unfinished songs as legacy—no abstraction, only the shard’s trembling glyphs making utopia tangible.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "poetically inclined by erosion of purpose"; syntax fractures under chrono-storms ("howled like widows") yet maintains rhythmic control. Voss’s dialogue carries subtext ("mourning in a language the universe forgot") without voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "ribbons of visible time" refracts physics into poetry without muddle. Only minor register drift: "archaeological dispute" feels academic in otherwise character-particular prose, but closure’s "burnished sorrow" redeems density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "revolutionary" trope through time-visibility mechanics: rebellion against forgetting feels inevitable. "Measuring wealth in shared silence" synthesizes political and poetic stakes into a non-obvious moral calculus that reshapes the genre.</comment>
