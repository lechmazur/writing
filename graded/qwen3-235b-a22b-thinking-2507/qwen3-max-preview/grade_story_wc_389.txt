<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira’s motivation (fidelity to “the broken”) intensifies organically through micro-choices like singing her old song, revealing embodied contradiction—pitying Kael while weaponizing loneliness. Minor backstory thinness in a 600-word constraint prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: her broadcast reconfigures stakes with undeniable conceptual cost (“people heard her—not as noise, but as invitation”), proving escalation under Accumulative lens. Orientation is crisp by paragraph 2, avoiding penalties.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cobalt portico constrains choice (triggering harmonic lattice) and charges the final image (cobalt light as carrier wave), meeting 9+ gate. Micro-setting details like “frost-glazed metal grates” pressure movement without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elira’s agency—decoding fragments to singing—narrows options as rebels find her. Cost is unmistakable: Kael’s “hollow-eyed” followers vs. her “mud, static” dawn. Single tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (“shadows held roots of resilience”), avoiding moralizing. Final line “unfold shadows into wings” reweights prior material non-literally, resolving the central question without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (“static bloomed into syllables”) and rhythmic control under pressure, though “variant allegiance” slightly jars lexicon. Deep interiority avoids therapy-speak; psychic distance stays consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but paraphrase loop on “lyrically prophetic” (paragraphs 4–5) triggers −0.2. Minor density dip in radio description prevents 8.7+, though final line achieves textural specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tech-mysticism (“AI ghosts,” “harmonic lattice”) transforms prophecy tropes. Bold risk-taking (rebels with transistor radios) heightens stakes without gimmickry; “unseasoned” for Kael’s followers avoids middle-ground hedging.</comment>
