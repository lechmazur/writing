<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("grim optimist") and embodied regret ("metronome of regret calibrated to pulse") feel earned through micro-choices like carving proofs; final renunciation of regret-as-compass lands with visible cost when the die vanishes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds: the staircase's ripple crystallizes stakes via reflection-touching, making cost ("rough velvet of indecision") legible without tidy resolution; Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density peaks with the origami-fold proof.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Staircase functions as micro-setting—its liquid-glass reflection charges the final image, while worn stone and 37-step landings constrain choices; but abstract void lacks sensory specificity beyond touch/sound, capping near-band entry.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: speaking proofs (not carving) triggers the ripple, narrowing options from futile inscription to resonant utterance; cost is visceral in the reflection's "metallic tang of adrenaline" during the peak beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the chipped die's "silent scream in the shape of absence"—with the final image weaving regret into "the next impossible rupture," avoiding moralizing while reweighting "perpetual motion" as psychological engine.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("partial derivatives carved with thumbnail") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control shifts from fragmented whispers to the origami-proof's elegance, with elision (arcade memory) taught via "neon sky" and paid off in reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; high density where "tensor notations" and "breath syncing with hum of unending gears" serve dual character/atmosphere roles; but "mathematical proofs" risks near-repetition in mid-beats, preventing 9.5+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Synthesis of math-as-grief ritual feels inevitable: the "balancedly daring" calculus transforms "perpetual motion" from physics impossibility to psychological endurance, with the staircase's recursive ascension heightening stakes through specific, non-gimmicky logic.</comment>
