<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via feather's dual purpose (mourning token/tuning fork) and embodied "pulse-syncing" with ruins. Final endurance ("carry the rhythm upward") earned through micro-choices like palm-pressing glass, though secondary pressure lacks depth for full 9.5.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density peaks when fireflies mirror reactor schematic, crystallizing stance via Charged Poise. Cost legible in feather cooling post-threshold ("no longer lonely"), though sunrise transition slightly softens the earned stasis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: viewport glass constrains choice (palm-pressing), jellyfish glyphs charge closure as "sacred texts." Feather's ember-glow directly reweights final image. Only minor deduction for anglerfish description slightly over-ornamenting pressure beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through fireflies' impossible spiral—a visceral "coincidence" testing her rhythm-seeking. Cost crystallizes as feather cools, foreclosing exile ("no longer lonely"). Lacks one visible tactical shift pre-closure to reach 9.5.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "turning loss into liturgy" avoids moralizing, while final feather-as-beginning reweights abandonment without abstraction. Fireflies' spiral answers "belonging" through co-creation, not declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless ("algae-slick corridors as braille maps"), rhythmic control intensifies under pressure (staccato sentences at firefly reveal). No head-hopping; "softly ingenious" repetition functions as intentional motif, not scaffold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "silted heart of a place" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Final line recharges feather motif without muddle. Minor deduction for "shadowseam wonder" slightly abstracting texture in one mid-beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "underwater ruin" trope via landscape astrologer's emotional ley lines. Saltwater fireflies feel earned through "rhythm" premise, not gimmickry. Risk-taking (science/soul fusion) heightens stakes while maintaining conceptual integrity.</comment>
