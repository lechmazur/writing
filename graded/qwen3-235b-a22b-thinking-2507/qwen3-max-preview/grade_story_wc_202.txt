<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "not from sorrow, but recognition" moment; historian's silent weeping reveals layered grief-as-resilience. Lacks micro-choice showing simultaneous fear/hope during climax, slightly softening final endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: lens dimming charges "truth whispered through brushstrokes" with conceptual cost. Hybrid lens (accumulative dominant) holds through triptych activation, though midpoint causality slightly overshadows textural buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Market's rope bridges and attic chamber constrain movement and reflection; "cracked glass" motif charges final image by transforming "elusively tangible" truths into embodied legacy. Sensory details like "velvet pouch" evolve with plot pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when translator presses fragment to triptych—agency-driven escalation narrows options to revelation or silence. Cost crystallizes in historian's recognition tears and spent lens, though physical cost could feel more visceral during activation beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "golden thread" metaphor reweighting erased histories as resilience. Nearly flawless, but "truth isn’t shouted" edges toward thematic echo; saved by immediate "whisper louder than bell" image charging prior motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives: "soles remembering sting of childhood rope burns" filters world through embodied history. Rhythmic control deepens under pressure ("Cold. Then warmth. Then—a whisper"), with zero head-hopping despite dual focal points.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "swirling with captured twilight" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor register drift in "architects of resilience" risks abstraction, but "laughter stitched into canvas like golden thread" rescues with concrete charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "translator" trope through origami birds trading in erased dialects. Risk-taking elevates stakes: mosaic-like triptych revelation feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Freshness in "lullabies sung by mothers whose names were scrubbed from ledgers" avoids sentimental cliché.</comment>
