<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied contradiction (chasing silence yet discarding assumptions), but the epiphany "she understood then why" leans toward over-articulation in peak tension, slightly flattening the earned shift from seeker to conductor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the towers' transformation into instruments with "visible cost" in the fragment's dissolution and her emotional shift ("didn't weep, smiled") reconfigures meaning under Accumulative/Textural lens without a single misstep.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The gorge's exhalation and rusted lattice become active constraints—mechanically breathing under her tuning—charging the final image where "towers sang on without her," satisfying the 9+ gate through micro-setting as functional environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via lunar perigee deadline and her discarding assumptions, narrowing options to a single resonant choice; cost is unmistakable in the fragment's dissolution and prior "seven cycles" of failure, though escalation could deepen the physical toll slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through the Hollywood fragment's arc—failed artifact crystallizing truth—avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights "endings contain beginnings" without stating it, delivering a non-literal answer through "sound of genesis" broadcasting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("negative space," "serenely electric") modulates under pressure, but "fantasy practicality" risks slight thematic abstraction; rhythmic control remains impeccable through the climax's compression ("She didn’t weep. She smiled.")</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffolding with high density, though "dull luster of oxidized chrome" edges toward generic metallic description; final line’s "sound of genesis" achieves crystalline propulsion without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via "fantasy practicality"—Hollywood debris as cosmic key—through specific, grounded mechanics; risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without obscuring the earned closure’s clarity.</comment>
