<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via embodied micro-choices (polishing rhythm steadying pulse) and contradictory impulses (surrender vs. purpose), but secondary character friction lacks depth beyond the child's cameo, capping near-exceptional range.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: her surrender to "quiet alchemy" forecloses vengeance with visible cost (creaking joints, resurfacing trauma), while the prismatic light reconfigures stillness as active witness under a flawless Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The grotto’s mist constrains visibility to force reliance on reflected light, charging the final image where sea glass fractures dimness into "living constellations"—environment directly shapes the climax’s resonance and tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through the polishing ritual: each stroke deepens the cost of sharing light without fire, narrowing options to surrender until the glass’s glow reweights "stillness" as communal solace with visceral emotional price (memories resurfacing without flinching).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The child’s "holding sky" whisper offers a non-literal answer to "can a shard hold meaning?"—reconfiguring the sea glass as shared sky rather than moral, with trauma transformed into prismatic hope without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable: "mist curled like sleeping dragons" and "joints creaking like old timber" reflect her geological worldview, while rhythmic control tightens under pressure (polishing strokes as breaths).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "reflectively vibrant" evolves meaningfully across beats, though slight register drift in "zephyr itself had bloomed" edges toward lyricism without muddling closure’s tactile clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms trauma tropes via geological metaphor ("pearl of stillness" as formed grief), with the polishing method synthesizing erosion and intention into radical hope—fresh inflection in "not weapon, but window" crystallizes the premise.</comment>
