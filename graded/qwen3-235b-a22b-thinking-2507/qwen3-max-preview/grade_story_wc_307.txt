<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elira’s backwards-aging paradox drives embodied contradiction: trembling hands withhold truth while weaving syllables, and her "younger face betraying none of the grief" shows external/internal dissonance under pressure. Kael’s micro-shift from frustration to revelation earns the closure without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: "Vanishing isn’t erasure—it’s preparation" reweights the premise with conceptual cost (absence as presence), validated by the pond’s symbol-reveal under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation clear by word 10; causality unbroken.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The pond’s ripples constrain choice (Kael must observe without intervention) and charge the closure as temporal notation. "Fractured light" transforms water into symbols, making the micro-setting indispensable—removing it would collapse the CR closure’s logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elira’s withholding agency: the stone toss forces Kael’s shift from "Why?" to revelation, narrowing options via the grotto’s humming constraint. Cost is felt in her grief over lost colleagues, visible when "her younger face betrayed none of the grief."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the pond’s evolving symbolism—ripples as "delayed revelation"—avoiding moralizing. The final "sycamore hush" reprise delivers a resonant non-literal answer: vanishing as preparation, with cost in Elira’s withheld final step.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "sycamore hush settled like dust" filters setting through Elira’s scientific-poetic lens. Rhythmic control under pressure ("concentric circles pulsed outward, each slower than the last") avoids uniformity; compression in "seventy-year-old hands trembling—not from age" intensifies stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cobalt and pearl" light description achieves high density without muddle. One minor filter verb ("she believed") is voice-motivated. Final line’s "sycamore hush" reprise charges closure with rhythmic propulsion, avoiding overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "wise mentor" trope via backwards-aging mechanic: vanishing as emergence feels inevitable through the pond’s ripple logic. Emotional specificity ("colleagues who called her mad") avoids abstraction, while the magnetic grotto’s "temporal echoes" synthesizes sci-fi with human stakes.</comment>
