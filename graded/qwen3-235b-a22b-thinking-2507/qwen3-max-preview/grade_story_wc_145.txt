<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in dry wit versus deep yearning ("rivers start with seepage, silence"), but "satisfaction of a question answered" feels abstract rather than embodied cost at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly—the ice sighing and spiral drawing reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost ("worrying tranquility replaced"), and Accumulative lens holds from condensation patterns to final resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The grimed window functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choices (reading condensation glyphs) and charges the final image—its cleaning mirrors the editor’s shift from seeking to witnessing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through linguistic thermodynamics, but pressure lacks tightening; the condensation method succeeds almost too effortlessly, missing a visible trade-off beyond tranquility’s loss at the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "rivers begin where language listens" reweights the entire quest non-literally, avoiding moralizing while making seepage/silence/stubbornness the story’s unspoken creed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable ("ink-stained cuffs," "brittle air"), though "thermodynamics and tongue" slightly fractures voice in a high-pressure beat where concrete action should dominate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops and rhythmic control elevate tension, but "condensation blooming in fractal reply" risks overwriting—its lyricism momentarily obscures the causal link between utterance and ice response.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Synthesizes cartography, linguistics, and hydrology into a fresh framework where "frostbite ink" and phrasebook-as-compass feel inevitable, not quirky; risk-taking heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
