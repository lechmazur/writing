<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "carefully reckless" duality; micro-choices like fist-pump then double-checking reveal value hierarchy under pressure. Final restoration choice earns cost through prior causality (betrayal explanation) without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "Trust would take years to rebuild" paired with prismatic light. Accumulative lens holds throughout—density escalates via sensory resonance (dust motes, ink well chime) reweighting the "shared sky" stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The glass ink well constrains choice and charges closure: its resonance during singing literally activates truth, while empty vessel casting prismatic light embodies "scattered promises kept." Micro-setting shapes tactics and final image with zero generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when linguistic betrayal (broken harmonic promise) is revealed, narrowing options to precise phoneme reconstruction. Agency drives escalation—her tuning against resonance charts directly enables the singing climax with visible cost (shaking hands, years-long trust rebuild).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Final image of prismatic light reweights "before paths diverge" without moralizing. Theme emerges through concrete particulars: ink well’s resonance proving truth requires embodied commitment, not abstraction. Avoids thematic echo via curator’s tears and physical decay.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature sharpens under pressure: "dust motes into spirals" and "chandelier emitted a single pure tone" filter physics through linguistic obsession. Voice modulates rhythm from meticulous ("cross-referencing every vowel shift") to exuberant ("fist-pump") without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "hollow body resonating" and "scent of rain on stone" achieve high density without muddle. Final line’s "prismatic shards across the floor" propels closure with crystalline specificity, avoiding overwriting despite lyrical intensity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Symphonies of truth transforms linguistic trope via acoustic stakes—truth literally shatters without harmonic fidelity. Fresh inflection: legal parchments containing musical notation reframes "treaty" as communal performance, avoiding abstraction through Syrathi glyphs and bell-tower resonance charts.</comment>
