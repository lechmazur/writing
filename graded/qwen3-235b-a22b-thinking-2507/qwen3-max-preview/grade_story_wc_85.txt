<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (distrust vs truth-seeking) manifest physically as "tremor in ribs" and vomiting; final choice to become "the sieve" earned through embodied revelation of father's sacrifice, not abstract epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: "vomited into the surf" and dissolving carvings make grief tangible; Accumulative lens holds as sensory density (ticking watch, warm wood) tightens pressure toward crystallized stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Driftwood carvings actively constrain choice—pressing watch to father's face triggers memory flood; final "cobalt terrace faded into indigo" charges closure by transforming initial "bruise" imagery into earned peace.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (withheld truth's weight) deepens through agency: Elira's decision to press watch to carving narrows options, with cost ("vomited," dissolving carvings) altering her future tactics ("weaving truth" instead of lies).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "ballast" metaphor reweights "sieved hush" without moralizing; final "hush... settled" answers central question by showing truth must be "worn down by water," not stated as abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in genealogist's precise observations ("rusted, bent, still ticking"); rhythm modulates under stress—fragmented phrases ("Not abandonment. Sacrifice.") heighten pressure without breaking voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; every sentence propels meaning ("tiles cool beneath bare feet as she clutched the watch hand—rusted, bent, still ticking"). Final line’s cadence ("until the hush... settled") resolves with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms "repressed memory" trope via functional sieved hush mechanic; risk-taking (lyric density over causality) heightens stakes as driftwood carvings literally deliver truth, making emotional resolution inevitable.</comment>
