<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and particular (e.g., joints stiffening at new moon), but the epiphany "Not resurrection. Resonance." edges toward abstraction without sufficient embodied cost in the climax beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully—the seepage of loss answers her song with tangible cost (enduring navigation without healing)—and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through rhythmic density buildup to the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The censer foot constrains choices (e.g., humming only when still during wane) and charges the final image (singing coordinates with it), while sensory details like "jasmine choked on diesel" filter through grief-stricken perception with perfect specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through her agency (e.g., avoiding crescent sliver after static trauma), but escalation lacks a decisive narrowing of options; the cost (perpetual navigation) is unmistakable yet the pressure intensification remains subtle for 8.8+ band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the final "seepage" of loss offers a resonant non-literal answer to grief without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo while charging the streetlamp/radio flickers with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature shines (e.g., "coordinates not latitude but scent and shadow"), with rhythmic compression under pressure ("Waits. Listens. Builds.") and zero head-hopping despite lyrical elision taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances story ("dial tone becomes a dirge" does triple duty for atmosphere/theme/motif), with figurative language crystalline even in peak beats like the moon "hanging like a wound".</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms grief tropes—moon-phase physiology shaping navigation tactics feels inevitable, with risk-taking (lyric structure) heightening stakes without gimmickry, though one inflection (reverse migration) edges toward familiar resonance metaphors.</comment>
