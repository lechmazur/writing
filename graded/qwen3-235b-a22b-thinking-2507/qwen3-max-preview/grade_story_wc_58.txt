<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority excels with embodied grief ("crunch beneath unseen feet an echo of explained absences") and contradictory impulses (mapping absence while rejecting closure), but final renunciation lacks sufficient causal groundwork for 9.0. Motivation for "geography of healing" remains slightly abstract despite vivid micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as perfect Charged Poise: "They mapped" crystallizes the traveler's stance with undeniable cost, reconfiguring absence into presence through the crane ritual. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds flawlessly with density building toward the folded parchment's release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Garden setting charges the final image—withered rosebush roots receiving the crane constrain choice and reweight decay as generative. "Frost on a widow’s window" exemplifies micro-setting that mirrors internal state without overt symbolism, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the obituary’s construction: each adjective becomes "a landmark" narrowing options toward the crane ritual. Cost is visceral in "hollows in the soul" and the traveler’s emotional labor, though escalation could deepen the "explanation" deception’s immediate pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Final line "every step stitches sky to sea" offers resonant, non-literal answer to healing’s geography, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Theme emerges organically from the carpet thread’s journey from tear-soaked artifact to memory conduit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lichen tears," "ocean trapped inside seashells") and rhythmic control shine in high-pressure beats. Voice modulates perfectly from elegiac to precise during obituary-writing, though minor overuse of em-dashes in reflective passages prevents 9.5.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "salt wind scoured regret" exemplifies high-density imagery advancing theme and character. Final image’s "lonesome splendor" avoids cliché through concrete specificity, though one borderline stock phrase ("majesty worn thin by time") costs 0.1.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography and grief transforms obituary tropes—Elira’s "geography of healing" feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though the carpet thread’s magic-adjacent resonance slightly echoes familiar talisman tropes.</comment>
