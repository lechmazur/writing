<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses (scientific rigor vs spiritual belief) manifest physically in blistered fingers and quiet resolve; her endurance earns closure via visible cost of collapse, though fishermen backstory test edges toward tell-not-show.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: ships correcting course without explanation crystallizes options with undeniable cost in "relief thick as honey" and physical collapse; Accumulative lens holds through scent diffusion pattern established by paragraph 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cobalt lighthouse constrains choice via peeling paint/salt damage reflecting Elara's state; jasmine scent evolves from description to active pressure point altering ship tactics, charging the final "liquid gold" image with environmental cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through scent propagation's irreversible spread, narrowing Elara's options to silent endurance; cost legible in physical collapse, though captain's shift lacks visible internal struggle escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Final wind-whispering image offers non-literal answer to "whispers travel farther" without moralizing; theme emerges through clenched fists uncurling and scent mechanics, avoiding all anti-patterns while embracing tenderness as active force.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct marine perceptual signature ("bruised sentinel," "tide whispered back") modulates under pressure; single-POV stability with rhythmic control in "vibration surged—not sound, but resonance" avoids over-explanation despite slight abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "raw and trembling" grounded immediately by "flowed into the cork"; final line "wind whispered back" achieves crystalline propulsion without figurative muddle in peak closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "magic object" trope via scientific framing ("core concept," vibration physics"); emotional specificity in "screaming tenderness" avoids abstraction, with cobalt lighthouse color essential to conceptual integrity of purification.</comment>
