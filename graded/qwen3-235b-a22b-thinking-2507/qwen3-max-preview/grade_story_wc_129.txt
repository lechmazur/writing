<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak through embodied details like "fingers braiding wet stalks into spirals that trembled like breath"; the final name-whispering choice earns transformation via prior causality with visible cost in shifting from "pleaded" to "announced" sculptures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "a hush fell—not silence, but communion" crystallizes Lira's reconfigured belonging with conceptual cost (surrendering solitary ache for communal vulnerability), holding the Accumulative/Textural lens through resonant reconfiguration of the arbor's glyphs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard's "quartz branches dripped liquid light" directly constrains the climax (Vesper's waiting place) and charges the final image where "reed-and-glass birds nest in crystal branches," making environment indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lira's agency: her sculpted clues ("hollow reed echoing Vesper’s sigil") deepen knowledge, narrowing options until the arbor's loom reveals kinship's true cost—transforming "luminescent ache" into earned communion without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: Vesper's tags "map webs of kinship," culminating in the final line where "loneliness learned to bloom" reweights the premise without moralizing, avoiding Thematic Echo through concrete particulars like glyphs "swirling like startled fish."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in stress: "twin moons" trek uses compressed diction ("Boldly sympathetic, Lira didn’t hesitate"), while Lira's tactile focus ("silver-knuckled hands") maintains consistent POV without head-hopping during communal emergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "river-polished stones, songs hummed in extinct tongues" achieves triple-duty density. Final line’s cadence ("loneliness learned to bloom") recharges the opening’s "luminescent ache" without figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms kinship tropes via concrete mechanics: the obsidian arbor as "loom for memory" (not metaphor) with glyphs as tangible "names" creates fresh inevitability, while risk-taking in Accumulative/Textural structure heightens emotional stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
