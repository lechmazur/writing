<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s anosmia-driven sensory shift ("emotional terrain through touch/sound") grounds interiority, but Ren’s epiphany ("miracles weren’t in the oil") resolves her fraudulence too neatly without prior contradictory impulses escalating pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with resonant Charged Poise closure ("miracles don’t need to be fragrant"), but lacks meaningful escalation; the single contemplative scene deepens stakes without tightening options or visible cost beyond internal realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The water clock’s "damp counter" and fog constrain Elara’s perception, charging the final image ("clock held gently like an offering"); micro-setting (screw’s "cold and blunt" weight) directly reconfigures closure by sanctifying ordinary miracles.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (professional identity vs purpose) deepen through Ren’s dialogue, but cost remains abstract; Elara’s fraudulence resolves via insight without tangible trade-off (e.g., losing clients), weakening pressure under Accumulative lens despite strong thematic reweighting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the screw’s evolution ("fulcrum" to "relic of becoming"), avoiding moralizing; the final image ("map the emotional terrain, one quiet miracle at a time") reweights "ordinary miracles" with conceptual cost, resisting tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s perceptual signature ("feeling for dust that wasn’t there") is distinct and sensory-substituted, but rhythmic control falters in mid-scene dialogue; Ren’s voice lacks idiom differentiation during pivotal "presence" monologue, slightly flattening tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet precise ("brass gears stilled, glass reservoirs half-empty"), but "calm as moonlit water" slightly overwrites Ren’s introduction; no loops or artifacts, though one ornamental phrase dilutes peak-beat density near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "broken things" trope via sensory substitution (anosmia → touch/sound mapping); the birthing screw’s reframing as "fulcrum" feels inevitable, but avoids derivative sentimentality through mechanical specificity ("stubbornly intact" gears).</comment>
