<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her shift from "gnawing need to reckon" to "reckons—not to solve, but to surrender," with embodied cost in "fingers stained with pigment and pollen." Lacks one layer of simultaneous contradictory impulses during peak discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "she watches the real flowers... their silent blooming a hymn" crystallizes options with felt cost ("heart heavier with purpose"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds flawlessly; cost proof anchored in physical details like "soul etched with light only darkness could reveal."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cathedral glass constrains choice (kneeling, lens use) and charges the final image ("light only darkness could reveal"). Pavilion’s "turpentine and dried lavender" evolves into paint mixed with "melted snow and crushed petals," directly shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency: uncovering layered blooms tightens options toward surrender. Cost is legible in "three nights... breathing cold air," but escalation leans slightly on discovered artistry rather than active choices during the critical glass examination.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ending’s "hymn older than cathedrals" offers non-literal answer to "why flowers bloom at night," reweighting the quest without moralizing. Theme emerges purely through "midnight blossoms" imagery and the altar postcard’s "continuation," avoiding any thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in "leaves skittered like half-remembered dreams" and cathedral’s "glass that seemed to swallow then release the fading sun." Rhythm modulates under pressure—shorter sentences during discovery—"tracing each pane as the last light bled through."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "icicles weeping from eaves like reluctant farewells" risks overwriting but earns payoff in emotional context. Final line’s "tender as the space between heartbeats" achieves crystalline propulsion without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "artist’s quest" trope via specific nocturnal botany and cathedral glass mechanics. "Umbral tenderness" reframes universal wonder through precise, verifiable details (cereus alignment with constellations), avoiding abstraction.</comment>
