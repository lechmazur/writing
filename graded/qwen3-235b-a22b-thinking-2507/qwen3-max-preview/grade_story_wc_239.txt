<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation ("housekeeping" not salvation) is consistent and embodied in dictionary revisions, but interiority lacks contradictory impulses—only one clear value hierarchy (clarity) with no competing flaws visible in pressure moments like the library's transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("she was the hush after") crystallizes the Accumulative lens with undeniable conceptual cost—the dissolution of self into silence—while maintaining causal coherence through the spiral arbitration’s progression from dictionary negotiation to unification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dictionary (tool) constrains choice by evolving from reference to convergence catalyst, charging the final image ("Convergence" runes), though the temple’s atmospheric density occasionally stalls momentum with ornamental sensory overload (e.g., "dust motes hung like frozen stars").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (unraveling cosmic illusions) tighten through the witness’s agency—rewriting definitions, initiating arbitration—yielding felt cost in self-dissolution, but escalation lacks a distinct mid-scene reversal; deepening occurs via steady accrual rather than a pivotal narrowing of options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "meaning is negotiated" reframed as "housekeeping" culminates in the hush-after image, reweighting prior labor with conceptual cost—truth as coherence, not revelation—avoiding moralizing while resonating through the dictionary’s dissolution into light.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("silence pooled thicker than ink") and rhythmic control sustain the Accumulative lens, though "wanderingly exact" strains lexicon plausibility for a character shedding identity, slightly disrupting voice consistency under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density propels momentum, but stacked metaphors ("lungs made of spacetime," "iron filings around a lodestone") in the climax risk muddle; minor scaffold appears in repetitive "unravel" phrasing without deepening pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cosmic labor ("housekeeping" as divine act) transforms metaphysical tropes through concrete stakes—the dictionary’s physical decay mirroring conceptual unbinding—with the hush-after resolution feeling inevitable yet startling in its quiet audacity.</comment>
