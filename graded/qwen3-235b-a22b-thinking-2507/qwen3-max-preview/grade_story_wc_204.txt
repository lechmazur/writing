<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract ("she believed eternity could be compressed") with sparse embodied contradiction; micro-choices under pressure lack concrete physicality despite clear motivation. Final endurance of chaos feels earned but lacks visceral cost manifestation beyond conceptual stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "perfection was ruined" crystallizes irreversible cost through glitching systems, with lens (Accumulative/Textural) holding via pattern-break escalation. Frost-to-aperture transformation reweights equilibrium stakes with undeniable conceptual price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Frost patterns function as micro-setting that charges the final image ("melting frost, now warm with latent energy"), but glass orchard remains atmospheric rather than actively constraining choices beyond providing frost mechanics. Library's glitching state after rupture meets 9+ gate through environmental consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stake escalation via protagonist agency ("lifted the bottled whisper... let its voice spill") drives conceptual cost under Accumulative lens; "perfection was ruined" makes felt price undeniable as systems glitch. Single tightening (uncorking) sufficiently narrows options to foreclose equilibrium.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme crystallizes through action: "chaos was not the enemy of meaning—it was its midwife" emerges from compressed moment's integration, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "equilibrium" with conceptual cost without stating a moral, fulfilling 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("reality had become negotiable—laws bent like reeds") modulates perfectly under pressure; "dimensional" crack description shows rhythmic control. Zero head-hopping, with lyrical compression taught early ("frost ignited into silver script").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "voice too soft for ears but loud enough to unsettle the geometry" demonstrates peak-beat density without muddle. Every line advances atmosphere or stakes, with "prismatic shards that dissolved before they struck" showing syntactic variety under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of "chaos as midwife" transforms philosophical trope through specific mechanics (frost patterns as instructions, bottled whisper). Emotional truth in "ruined perfection" avoids abstraction, fulfilling 9+ quick test with risk-taking that heightens coherence.</comment>
