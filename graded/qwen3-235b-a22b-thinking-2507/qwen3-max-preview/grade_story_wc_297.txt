<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (fusion vs. purpose) drives micro-choices; "precise hunger" embodies "purposefully curious" trait during pivotal clipping press. Scars as conduits—not wounds—reveal character-specific worldview under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: roots merging permanently anchor her to enable covenant revival. Causal lens holds through "because/therefore" (clipping press → light eruption), with persistent constraint (scars) shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt glade constrains choice—roots anchor her to perform ritual—and charges final image via "cobalt of the glade itself" helix. Sensory specificity ("scent of iron and incense") filters through POV bias without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: pressing clipping forecloses escape path with visible cost (permanent rooting). Escalation culminates in covenant's stirring, reweighting options via "light erupted... voices rose" cadence shift under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image reweights covenant theme non-literally: "helix of liquid shadow" embodies obscured vows reborn. Avoids moralizing; "Lies." preceding vow defense earns thematic complexity through embodied stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "bruised sky" and "static and smoke" reflect visionary’s fractured time-perception. Rhythmic control under pressure via fragmented clauses ("It sank. The ground exhaled.") avoids syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "pulsed with anxious elation" compresses dual emotion without label-speak. "Liquid shadow" avoids purple prose via concrete texture. Final "breathing in unison" line charges closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "chosen one" trope through root-binding as voluntary sacrifice. Fresh inflection: covenant "fester, twist, wait" reframes bureaucratic erasure as active resistance. Emotional specificity in "time-stranded fools" avoids abstraction.</comment>
