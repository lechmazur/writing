<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (logical/emotional) manifest in micro-choices like syncing breath with ice groans; exhaustion cost feels earned. Slight flaw underuse before climax weakens tension escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: "sank to the floor, exhausted" crystallizes cost while "keeper of balance" reconfigures stakes. Orientation perfect; causal lens holds through vibrational escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina actively constrains choices (cracks sealing under soles); Heartstone's cerulean light charging the final image meets 9+ gate. Mercury basin ripple evolves causally with assault.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: scavenger attack forces vibrational singing as sole option. Cost legible in physical collapse; "fleeting sunset" clock intensifies pressure without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "violence answered with frequency" crystallized in "sonic absolution" without moralizing. Final image reweights premise via "weaver of waves" resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("calibrating beacon harmonics" vs "ice sang back"); rhythm modulates under stress. Slight overwriting in "bones ache with purity" barely touches high-band threshold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion but "fierce as glacier’s birth" slightly muddles "gentle lullaby" metaphor in peak beat. No loops; strategic telling compresses backstory efficiently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sonic physics/spirituality avoids cliché; "transmuting dissonance into sonic absolution" feels inevitable. Risk-taking elevates stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
