<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "diplomatically fierce" restraint versus mechanical precision, but motivations ("First Accord" pursuit) lean abstract without visceral cost. Micro-choices like refusing to gloat at triumph reveal hierarchy of values, though emotional stakes lack physical consequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: shadow alignment at 11:03 crystallizes options with conceptual cost (stewardship of rediscovered knowledge). Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density, with orientation anchored by 78 words ("glass atrium," "three dawns," "10:17").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Half-painted sundial constrains every choice—negative space angles dictate decoding tactics. Final image of shadow sliding into next coded angle charges closure, satisfying 9+ gate. Brook’s timing evolves causally with plot, never static.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (decoding overture before noon) tightens via live clock (10:17→11:03→noon), narrowing options through protagonist agency. Cost is conceptual (weight of rediscovered cultural artifact), but lacks physical or relational consequence to enter 9.0 band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "silences shaped by logic" becomes navigable musical paths. Final image ("shadow slid quietly into the next coded angle") offers resonant answer to "uncover" quest without moralizing, reweighting the overture as perpetual journey.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: philosopher notices mechanical/geometric details ("brass fingers twitching," "hairline fissure"), woman traces shadows. Rhythmic control under pressure ("pens dancing in counterpoint") avoids head-hopping. Zero register drift despite high-stakes intellectual climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "prismatic shards across the marble floor—each one a silent herald" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor overwriting in "dignified chaos" description, but figurative language serves accumulative lens without muddling closure’s precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: philosophical duel as musical decoding via sundial physics. Transformation test passed—removing mechanical arm or needle card breaks causal logic. Risk-taking (abstract stakes as driver) heightens coherence without gimmickry, with specificity in "Danish tin sewing needle card" cipher.</comment>
