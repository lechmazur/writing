<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in embodied choices (buckle taps as "patience"/"prepare") avoids therapy-speak; flawed past judgment ("storm too soon") creates credible stakes. Slight underdevelopment in contradictory impulses during climax weakens 9+ potential.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "no panic... just trust held firm" crystallizes stakes with visible cost ("she had not flinched"). Orientation clear by paragraph 1; Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation to vibration-based resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Nocturnal arbor functions as active constraint: bioluminescent vines pulse warnings, wind-chimes hum forecasts. Buckle’s tactile use charges final image ("re-clipped... private vow"). Only missing minor evolution of setting during tremor sequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single tightening via low-frequency tremor forces decisive action; cost legible in "trust held firm because she had not flinched." Agency-driven escalation flawless, but conceptual cost lacks visceral physicality for 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "burden... borne with invention" crystallized in final image of walking toward "next quiet place." Avoids moralizing; "silence was the signal" reweights premise with undeniable social cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("body remembers truth when mind drowns in doubt"); rhythm modulates with pressure (short sentences during tremor: "No panic. No flight."). Slight register drift in "attentively inventive" contained by context.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "soundless echo spread... as vibration" exemplifies concrete specificity. "Attentively inventive" slightly abstract but redeemed by immediate action. Closure beat ("wind rose... memory of silence") flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "watcher" trope through muscle-memory communication and sky-whale ecology. Specific details ("trained moths," "ironwood railing") avoid generality; risk-taking with silence-as-communication heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
