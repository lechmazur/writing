<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: silence as "security" vs "starvation" crystallizes through embodied longing ("tremble of ribs against walls"). Final choice to climb higher earns Earned Stasis with visible cost in the doll's transformation. Father remains off-page, limiting relationship pressure despite strong micro-choices under inversion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands flawlessly: "They would not return unchanged" crystallizes irreversible stance with cost in the doll's partial fusion ("half-merged with the trellis"). Accumulative lens holds throughout—pressure intensifies via layered silences until the gravity inversion catalyzes the child's accumulated hunger into decisive action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The doll functions as essential micro-setting: its porcelain seams sprouting gold threads directly constrains the final choice (pressing "half-merged" doll to chest) and charges closure by stitching "fear to freedom." Concrete textures (concrete drip vs. petal width) embody the stakes without symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silence as starvation vs. curated security) tightens when gravity inversion enables the climb—agency lies in choosing "up" over corridors. Cost is undeniable in the doll's transformation and irreversible separation from the bunker, charging the final image where "thunderstorms and lullabies" silence reweights the hunger.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "intangibly tangible" motif reweighted at closure: the doll's sprouting threads make gratitude visible, answering "what is silence?" without moralizing. Final image's "thunderstorms and lullabies" offers non-literal resolution—silence as wild nourishment—avoiding balance while embracing complexity (bunker silence unambiguously suffocates wonder).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: silence "dissolved on the tongue like spun sugar," condensation's "echoing drip" as first language. Rhythmic control peaks during sensory tasting ("crisp, crystalline quiet... ghost of wings"), compressing diction under stress without POV leakage. Zero head-hopping; free indirect style stays consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold. "Intangibly tangible" risks abstraction but is redeemed by concrete tasting sequence. Final line achieves textural specificity ("thunderstorms and lullabies—uncontained, unafraid") without figurative muddle. Gold threads "fine as spider silk" avoids cliché through precision, advancing both image and theme.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms bunker trope through sensory reframing: silence as flavor with "aftertaste on the soul" feels inevitable. Emotional truth in craving unexperienced sensations ("brush of wind that never came"). "Xenial trellis" avoids generic fantasy; transformation test passes—changing names would break the sensory logic.</comment>
