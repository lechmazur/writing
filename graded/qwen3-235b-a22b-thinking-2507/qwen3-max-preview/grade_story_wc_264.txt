<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>No interior contradiction shown—engineered emptiness precludes conflicting impulses. Motivation is clear but lacks friction; the single action (humming) reveals no hierarchy of values under pressure. Micro-choice absent; cost ("shoulders softened") feels conceptual rather than earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the trembling clock hand crystallizes reignited potential with felt cost ("weight lightened by a single breath"). Orientation clear by para 1 (dreamless guard on glowing dune post-burns). Escalation weak—no meaningful tightening of options under Accumulative lens beyond the single charm action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dune's bioluminescent petals actively constrain movement ("boots sinking") and charge the final image ("petals pulsing like slow heartbeats"). Chess clock's physical coldness and trembling hand directly reconfigure the ending. Micro-setting (petals/sand) shapes all choices and closure with undeniable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cultivating sparks) signaled early but never tested—no resistance or trade-off during charm action. Escalation absent; pressure doesn't intensify beyond the initial archive entry. Cost ("lightened weight") is conceptual but lacks tactical consequence, failing to narrow options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of the trembling clock reweights "silence as freight" into reignited possibility without moralizing. Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the village's breath-synchronized communication embodies "potential" better than abstract statements. No thematic echo—resonance built from dune petals to humming containers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose embodies "fractured lullaby" rhythm through syncopated syntax ("each step a half-note, each breath a sigh"). Perceptual signature shines: quantum concepts filtered through tactile details (clock's "cold face," "ash-carved" earth). Zero POV leaks; voice modulates perfectly from clinical ("engineered for vigilance") to lyrical ("harmony that needed no tongue").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "latent divergence" justifies slight jargon as character-particular. High density: "bioluminescent petals that pulsed like slow heartbeats" establishes setting/stakes/theme in one stroke. Minor overwriting in archive spheres ("gravity sang in minor key" feels generic) barely dents peak-beat clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms quantum tropes through tactile freshness: "freight as silence," "charm as resonance." Village communicating via breaths avoids abstraction. Risks unconventional structure (Accumulative lens) without gimmickry—the prose rhythm *is* the stakes. Derivative archive concept elevated by dune's memory-glow and ash-carved earth.</comment>
