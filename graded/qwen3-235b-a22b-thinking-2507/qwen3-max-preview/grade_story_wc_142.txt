<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira’s dual allegiance manifests in concrete micro-choices (redirecting foot traffic, timing murals to market days), but her flaw—compromising between anarchic spirit and architect background—lacks inevitable mistakes that compound; the stone chip’s warmth offers embodied cost yet internal conflict remains slightly abstract during climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mural’s "map of the raft city as it remembers itself" crystallizes options with conceptual cost (privatization "postponed," not defeated), but the developers’ defeat feels slightly soft—contracts "unsigned" lacks visceral forfeiture beyond glitter-drowned blueprints, nudging cost toward hopeful abstraction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The raft city’s salt-stained wood and creaking pontoons actively constrain choices (e.g., murals timed to market days), while the foundation stone chip charges the climax—warmed by city roots during the final mural, it becomes the "compass rose made of carnival tickets," reconfiguring setting as both anchor and metaphor without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lira’s agency (graffiti reorganizing space), with conceptual cost legible in "privatization stalls... postponed," yet escalation lacks a narrowing trade-off—her methods succeed too smoothly against corporate scouts, missing a tangible loss (e.g., a mural defaced) to deepen pressure before the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: eviction notices folded into origami cranes, rent hikes camouflaged by optical illusions. The final banner "THIS FLOATS TOGETHER" reweights gentrification as collective endurance without moralizing, but "hopeful desperation" slightly over-articulates the emotional aftereffect, skirting sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in Lira’s "orderly intuitive" mapping of chaos ("cotton candy stalls aligned with wind direction"), yet stress degrades thought inconsistently—peak moments ("dances while packing boxes") retain lyrical polish where compression would heighten pressure, slightly diluting psychic immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density ("contracts slither through alleyways like eels") with rhythmic control, but "hopeful desperation fuels her nights" edges toward abstract label-speak in a high-pressure beat, risking emotional ventriloquism; no loops or scaffold, though one borderline cliché ("tired fireflies") slightly dulls novelty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synthesizes gentrification tropes through the raft city’s physical fragility (pontoons straining under rising rents), with graffiti-as-resistance feeling inevitable. The "foundation stone chip" transforms from relic to compass, avoiding derivative premises—yet the carnival’s "anarchic spirit" leans slightly archetypal without grittier contradictions.</comment>
