<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in sensory action ("fingers tracing oily floor as if reading braille") avoids therapy-speak; embodied emotion in climax ("wept for unbearable lightness of knowing") earns change through causal cost of erased existence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("truths don't set you free—they make you responsible"); Hybrid lens (Causal/Accumulative) holds through shard mechanics and emotional reconfiguration without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Abandoned repair bay functions as micro-setting constraining choices (shard placement on console); recurring glass shard charges final image ("cool and still, its purpose woven into her bones") with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency through shard vibrations narrowing options; cost crystallizes in Sigma-7 as erased existence, reweighted by the archival chamber discovery with undeniable felt consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (shard's resonance, mother's sacrifice); final line reweights premise without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo while delivering resonant non-literal answer to "withheld truth" question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sensed through scent, vibration, faint electric hum") modulates rhythm under pressure; consistent free indirect style avoids filter verbs while compressing transit via "stepping through syrup made of memory".</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high-density prose ("dust motes... ghosts of engines long silenced") advances plot/character simultaneously; no figurative muddle in climax where shard "flared, then dimmed—not broken, but fulfilled".</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms multiverse tropes through sensory-specific navigation; "erased existence" revelation grows organically from shard mechanics, avoiding derivative templates while risking emotional weight over spectacle.</comment>
