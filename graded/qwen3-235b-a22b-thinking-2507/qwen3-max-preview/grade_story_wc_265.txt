<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete ("intuition hummed beneath his skin"), micro-choices under pressure (dipping gear in mercury), and closure choice earned through unraveling journey. Slight lack of secondary conflict depth holds back final 0.3 points despite flawless motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as perfect Charged Poise: stepping into void crystallizes options with undeniable cost (forest bowing, gear spinning). Orientation clear by paragraph one; Accumulative lens holds through resonant reconfiguration without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mechanical rainforest constrains every choice (vines unspooling, wind guiding steps) and charges final image as micro-setting. Mercury waterfall's weight-absorbing property directly enables climax, satisfying 9+ gate through causal pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by protagonist's agency under Accumulative lens: wind-guided steps narrow options toward Edge. Cost unmistakable in final image—"unraveled himself" pays off as he floats into void with gear spinning, reconfiguring reality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (gear, hum, void) without moralizing. Final line "where thinking ended and knowing began" offers resonant non-literal answer to central question, reweighting the premise through earned conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("maple sighs rendered in metallic harmonics") with rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulates perfectly from resignation to recognition; no head-hopping despite single-POV intensity at climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "resonant thrum that vibrated up his arm and rattled his molars" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Final paragraph's "reconfigure—not breaking, but breathing" avoids figurative muddle while charging closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical rainforest and sixth sense transforms tropes; risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. "Probable miracles" tone feels inevitable through concrete details like mercury waterfall's weight-memory.</comment>
