<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "shyly unstoppable" trait (singing despite fear), but motivation lacks visible friction—photosynthesizing pain feels idealized without tangible struggle against the process itself. Micro-choices like pressing the postcard to the shell deepen embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the new postcard message ("They’re listening. Keep singing") crystallizes her endurance with felt cost (eternal insomnia persisting). Accumulative lens holds as density intensifies via lyrical psalm, reweighting the dominant stake of sorrow’s surrender.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Gargantuan shell functions as micro-setting that charges closure—her voice vibrates through calcium walls, fossilizing verses into crab-readable frescoes. Bioluminescent canopy and galaxy postcard constrain choices, with the shell’s spiral structure mirroring time’s collapse at the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: the postcard’s new message triggers her shift from lullabies to psalm, narrowing options to "sing or cease." Cost is unmistakable—she never sleeps, yet finds rest only "in the spaces between her words," charging the final image with earned endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "reef-shadow joy" as a resonant answer—beauty persisting because it bends in darkness—avoiding moralizing. Final image of the humming postcard nestled in her ribs reweights the premise without abstraction, though the explicit definition slightly risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: shell-echoes shape syntax ("time didn’t tick—it spiraled"), with rhythmic control deepening under pressure ("cracked it open across centuries of longing"). No head-hopping; elision of visitors’ dialogue taught early via "never acknowledged them."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose density risks overwriting in mid-section ("petals unfurling like flags of truce" followed by "orchids erupted from scorched earth"), slightly muddling pressure. Zero scaffold, but stacked metaphors in high-stakes beats (e.g., "galaxies learning to blush") dilute propulsion by 0.3.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesizing war trauma with botanical cosmology ("supernovae shaped like peonies"). Risk-taking (lyric mosaic structure) heightens stakes—time spirals without disorientation—while "blossom armistice" transforms familiar tropes through visceral, character-particular stakes.</comment>
