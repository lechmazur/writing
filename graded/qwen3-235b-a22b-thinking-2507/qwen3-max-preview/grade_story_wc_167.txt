<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong interiority via concrete observation ("calloused fingers tracing cool curve") but motivation remains abstract ("illuminate value in mundane") without visible flaw-complication; micro-choices like stone-dropping lack stakes escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: carrying "noctilucent reckonings as compass points" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost ("world never just what it seemed"). Orientation anchors by line 3; accumulative lens holds through mist-fraying denouement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting (tide pool) constrains ritual timing and charges final image—prism tucked away as mist frays. Wet stone, river stone, and refracted light actively shape tactics, avoiding postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via accumulative pressure: rings fading and mist fraying narrow options toward quiet endurance. Cost is conceptual (ephemerality of clarity), legible in "ghost-map of forces" and "breath before everything shifts" tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through Widow Hargrove’s prism transforming laundry lines into "gallery of living stained glass," avoiding moralizing. Final line reweights premise as non-literal answer: "what you chose to see between the lines" charges closure with earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "fog clinging low like breath held too long" filters dawn through glazier’s physics-based spirituality. Rhythmic control in stone-drop sequence ("splash small, almost polite... rings spread in concentric perfection") heightens pressure without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "knees protesting" shows age without cliché. Minor deduction for "his motivation was simple" abstraction in high-pressure beat. Final line’s "carried... compass points" avoids overwriting while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms "beauty in mundane" trope via glazier’s physics-rooted spirituality ("listened to physics, to resonance"). Risk-taking in quiet closure deepens stakes: consecrating ordinary becomes active resistance against "loud and brash" reality.</comment>
