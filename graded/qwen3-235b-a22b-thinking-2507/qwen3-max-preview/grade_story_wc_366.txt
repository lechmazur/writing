<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak; sea glass as embodied safety anchors contradictory impulses (isolation vs. connection). Final stone ritual earns quiet transformation through micro-choices, though cost ("luminescent ache") lacks visceral friction to hit 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: stone arrangement crystallizes stance with felt cost ("ache... luminescent, glowing softly"). Accumulative lens holds—pressure builds via sensory density (velvet dark, river-smooth stones)—and cost proof is undeniable in final heartbeat metaphor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sea glass functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (tactile anchor during crisis) and charging the final image ("pulsed against his ribs"). Every detail serves pressure: lantern room’s "strange warmth" mirrors memory, not static backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving connection against grief) tightens via lamp outage forcing stone ritual. Agency is clear, but escalation leans on coincidence (light failure) rather than pure protagonist-driven pressure under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from stones’ silent language ("You are not alone") and final hum "for anyone—or no one." No moralizing; closure reweights grief as "luminescent" beacon without stating a moral, satisfying Q5 quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: gulls as "feathered tax collectors," stress compressing syntax ("He froze, hand on wick-case"). Voice modulates perfectly from reticent opening to louder hum, with zero head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "luminescent, glowing softly in the dark" risks purple but earns it through emotional specificity. Rhythm varies naturally (short beats in crisis, flowing cadence at close), with no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse tropes via letter chain and stone cairns—fresh inflection where grief becomes "luminescent" through action, not epiphany. Avoids sentimentality by grounding hope in ritual ("fragile chain"), though premise edges close to familiar melancholy.</comment>
