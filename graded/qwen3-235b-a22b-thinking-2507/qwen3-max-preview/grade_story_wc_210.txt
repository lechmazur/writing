<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion (bottle's warmth as "consequence") and micro-choices (sweeping dust into mandalas), but lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal moments. Final renunciation of nostalgia as blueprint feels earned yet insufficiently conflicted under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost ("weight of what we didn't dare try") under accumulative lens. One hairline flaw: mayor's backstory retroactively patches causality without altering present tactics, slightly muddying escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Environment actively constrains choices—dust becomes mandalas, cobblestones birth lanterns. The bottle functions as micro-setting charging the final image ("pulsed faintly each night"), with sensory details filtered through alchemist's pragmatic-poetic bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>Escalation deepens through protagonist agency (sketches, placed objects) narrowing options from isolation to collective participation. Cost is legible in "uninvited heirs" dust, but lantern emergence blurs whether it stems from alchemist's actions or town's will.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "lanterns lit by communal will" reweights revival as rebirth. Final line ("civilization was not restored. It was reborn") delivers non-literal answer without moralizing, avoiding false equivalence between nostalgia and reinvention.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("dust settled like uninvited heirs"), with rhythmic control modulating from desolate cadence to hopeful fragments. Single-POV remains stable under pressure, avoiding filter-verb stacks despite high interiority density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; "thought given weight, ambition given contour" slightly strains metaphor but stays voice-motivated. Final line achieves crystalline propulsion. One near-duplicate in "not storage, not archive" risks cadence monotony yet serves intentional lyricism.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms ghost-town trope through "working memory made manifest"—specific details (moonstone ink, cobblestone lanterns) avoid cliché. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes, though "rebirth" concept borders on familiar without full derangement.</comment>
