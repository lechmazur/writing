<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak but "phototropic to kindness" borders on diagnostic label; micro-choices like water offering reveal values, yet internal contradiction remains underdeveloped despite strong embodied motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis ("let vessel stay soft") reconfigures resistance with visible cost; Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly as layered time imagery tightens toward "light through fractures" crystallization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Abandoned hives actively constrain choices (clay molding on hive stand); final image of "time curling upward" charges closure through setting's porous decay, fulfilling 9+ gate for environment shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through porous vessel choice (sacrificing permanence for living continuity), but pressure lacks visceral escalation; "flattened smoke" timeframe fails to tighten tactics despite thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Light through fractures" finale reweights resistance without moralizing, yet "kindness is the only force" risks Thematic Echo; earned wisdom emerges from water offering's concrete cost, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("dunes shifting like liquid regret"), but "phototropic" exposition disrupts voice; rhythmic control falters in "timeline not yet broken" abstraction during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in closure beats, but paraphrase loops ("resisted change... resisted collapse") and triadic "tender, unbroken, humming" slightly dull final image’s propulsion despite lyrical density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>"Porous vessel as resistance" synthesizes craft/ecology freshly, yet "fractured timelines" feels derivative; risk-taking elevates stakes but doesn't transform the trope sufficiently for 9.0+.</comment>
