<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete ("marrow of her bones") and flaw-driven, but lacks contradictory impulses in action; micro-choices under pressure remain underdeveloped despite strong embodied emotion during memory release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost (silence deepening into presence); orientation is anchored by word 10, and accumulative escalation via memory density perfectly serves the lens without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The stained glass box constrains every choice and charges the final image; sensory details like "pigeon bones" and "scent of lilac" are filtered through the skeptic’s scientific lens, avoiding tourist cataloging while evolving causally with memory releases.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberating memories) tightens through the key insertion at Fountain Twelve, reweighting options via memory density; cost is legible in the deepened silence, though escalation lacks a narrowing of live options under accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "defiant hush" charging the final gurgle; avoids moralizing by showing memory’s weight via "pigeon bones" and "wedding button," with the last line’s single drop offering non-literal resolution to forgetting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("scientific ghost," "plausible miracle") persists under pressure; rhythmic control in "gurgled once, then sighed" demonstrates voice modulation without elision issues or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; "trapped auroras" slightly strains physics but doesn’t obscure closure, while "slap of bare feet on wet stone" exemplifies textural specificity driving momentum in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "forgotten fountains" trope through the skeptic’s "realistically imaginative" lens; the final gurgle is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis where specificity ("oldest, driest") makes universality inevitable without abstraction.</comment>
