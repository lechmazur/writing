<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied choices ("sat without invitation," tracing knots) rather than labels; contradictory impulses (urgency vs. patience) crystallize in the "collecting hands" shift with Havel’s physical fragility as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: Havel’s exhaustion ("snow fell heavier") and the rope’s weight foreclose passive observation, reconfiguring "seeds" into "hands" through accumulative pressure that tightens via micro-choices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The fulgurite and rope function as micro-settings that constrain choice (offering as trust-builder, knot patterns as language); snow’s progression charges the final image ("oceanic hush deepened — not empty, but full") with tangible cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency (asking to "learn to read" knots), narrowing options from observer to participant; Havel’s physical toll ("snow fell heavier") provides felt cost, though escalation lacks one sharper tightening beat mid-scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through knot semantics ("storm’s eye" = waiting/ready), avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights "silence" as active preservation ("brimming with knots yet to be tied") without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct (geological/artisanal diction: "fulgurite," "tide pools"); dialogue carries subtext ("You brought the sky’s broken tooth") and modulates rhythm under pressure with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet precise ("fog curled around their shoulders like a shawl"), but three em-dash constructions in opening paragraph risk template cadence; no loops touch closure, preserving propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "knowledge preservation" trope through tactile specificity (knot semantics, fulgurite as symbol); risk-taking in accumulative structure feels inevitable, with oceanic hush modulating from setting to thematic anchor.</comment>
