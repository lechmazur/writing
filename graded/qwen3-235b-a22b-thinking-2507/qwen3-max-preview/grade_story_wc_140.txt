<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction crystallizes in "he sought texture—the rasp of a voice that once laughed" amid isolation; micro-choices like sitting with the child’s shoe for three tides reveal hierarchy of values with embodied cost. No secondary characters limit relationship bullets but single-POV baseline excels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: "the nameless were not gone. They were layered" forecloses paths with visible cost of solitary endurance. Orientation anchored immediately; Accumulative/Textural lens holds with tide-driven pressure reweighting erasure. Cost proof clear in "waiting—not to be remembered by names, but by texture."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Shipping containers function as micro-setting constraining choices (tides forcing movement upward) and charge closure via "rust, the salt, the steel." Recurring poison label’s "brittle as forgotten vows" directly charges final image. Sensory specificity avoids symbolism—salt-stung silence mirrors internal state through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via tide rhythm: high tide drowns alleys, forcing upward movement that narrows options. Agency in renunciation ("he didn’t seek redemption") forecloses paths with conceptual cost of perpetual scavenging. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens but cost leans slightly abstract vs. visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "stitching a counter-narrative, one overheard sigh at a time" avoids moralizing. Final image reweights erasure as "layered" existence without stated moral. Avoids anti-patterns—no thematic echo, complexity embraced via "memory, a contraband."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "he heard symphonies of the nameless—songs without composers" filters world through Elias’s erasure. Rhythmic control under pressure ("tides lapping the docks below, their rhythm a metronome") with no head-hopping. Lyric compression taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "the rust, the salt, the steel" avoids cadence monotony through intentional repetition. Figurative language ("stains brittle as forgotten vows") charges closure without muddle. Minor deduction for "texture" near-repetition in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms bureaucratic death trope via port-specific texture motif: "grit beneath memory’s skin" grounds universals in shipping-container reality. Fresh inflection in how tides dictate scavenging rhythm. Avoids derivative pitfalls—erasure made tactile through smudged receipts and unwashed stains.</comment>
