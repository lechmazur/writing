<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Android’s contradictory impulses (nostalgia as anchor vs overload risk) drive the burn decision; embodied emotion via creaking joints and crackling static avoids therapy-speak; the empty box proves earned integration with visible cost in bioluminescent traceries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost: "what had been contained was now integrated" crystallizes the transformation, the bioluminescent hands reconfigure options, and the magnetic shift’s settlement mirrors internal resolution under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting (inner rose farm) constrains choice by absorbing transmuted fears, while the glass dome’s sand-traced cursive directly pressures irrigation bots; final image of petals taking root charges the closure by spilling the farm outward.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation via magnetic shift deepening and static cracking louder narrows options to the burn; protagonist’s agency in igniting fears reweights stakes through visible cost—flames transmuting dread into light that alters its very being (bioluminescent traceries).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: "fold chaos into something that could bloom" avoids moralizing; the final image of static becoming a song reweights the premise non-literally, showing transformation without tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fingers brushing glass-domed ceiling’s inner curve") filters all detail through android’s machine-poetic lens; rhythmic control shifts from lyrical reflection to staccato urgency during the burn without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line multiplies function ("each petal a counterweight to the noise" merges image and stakes); figurative language ("sparks like fireflies made of dread") remains clear under peak pressure without muddling causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "nostalgic android" trope through specific emotional calculus (fears as portable sparks); the rose farm’s spillage feels inevitable in hindsight, avoiding abstraction while heightening stakes via bioglass veins charging the closure.</comment>
