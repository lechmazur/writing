<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "ribs crack—not with pain, but release," embodying earned endurance. Slight abstraction in backstory flashes ("child screaming into mirror") lacks concrete sensory anchors, diluting embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: "ribs crack" as release crystallizes cost, and "lake drained into sky" reconfigures stakes with conceptual weight. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through patterned escalation of frozen confessions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard vortex constrains choice physically and thematically—"faces flickered in the ice" forces confrontation. Final image of "crown of thorns and petals" charges closure through recurring object, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through "expanding circles" method: roots peeling armor forecloses denial with visceral cost ("ribs crack"). Agency-driven deepening (not reversal) suffices for length, but cost proof in final image lacks one precise on-page anchor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally via "mirrors lie" realization and final "face you are when no one is watching." Avoids moralizing, but "warlike serenity" phrasing borders on thematic echo, slightly muddying earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("obsidian mirrors," "thorn-vines and silence") remains fiercely consistent. Rhythmic control peaks in "roots unfurled beneath her flesh, mapping veins," compressing tension without loss of voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "green shoot piercing her skin, not to harm, but to anchor" demonstrates peak information density. Slight register drift in "conceptual repricing" phrasing, but closure image ("walked back across the now-still lake") remains pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "flesh-eating seed" trope into truth-revealing mechanism through specific causality. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes, but "warlike serenity" risks cliché without stronger contextual grounding.</comment>
