<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract ("widening her perception") without embodied contradiction under pressure; motivation clear but cost limited to physical fatigue rather than genuine struggle with the duality she embodies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with conceptual cost (wisdom's fragility), but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—pressure plateaus as the ritual unfolds predictably without narrowing options or deepening stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Pavilion and dunes rendered with exquisite sensory detail, yet environment fails to constrain choices; kinetic parapet responds compliantly rather than imposing tangible obstacles that alter tactics during consecration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving wisdom) is clear and resonant, but conflict lacks authentic pressure—dunes' "jealousy" and murmuring remain atmospheric rather than testing commitment with escalating cost or meaningful trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "clearings" as psychic hollows; final image ("wisdom’s echo, preserved, alive, waiting") reweights the prophet’s teaching without moralizing, achieving profound resonance through absence and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("whisperfield calm," "scent of dry sage and ozone") and rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping, with lyrical compression taught early and paid off in the closure’s charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless prose with purposeful rhythm variation; minor filter-verb cluster ("she felt the parapet respond... aligning with her intent") in a high-pressure beat prevents 10.0 but doesn’t obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ritual ecology and wisdom preservation; "conjured clearings" as essence-holding voids transforms tropes through specific mechanics, avoiding abstraction while heightening stakes via tangible fragility.</comment>
