<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is concrete and particular—her walk-reading skill manifests in embodied micro-choices (pocketing the coin, silent tracking) that intensify under pressure. Contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. caution) drive her toward Sector Theta, with closure earned through renunciation of confrontation. Delgado’s flatness is forgivable as secondary pressure; flaws like storm-disrupted gaits compound stakes without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Delgado’s whispered confession crystallizes the "key with no lock" concept with undeniable conceptual cost ("by morning, Delgado would be gone"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density escalation—storm static, coin’s weight, map’s paths—narrowing options to Lena’s silent evidence-passing. Orientation anchors firmly by line 3; cost is legible in the final whisper’s echo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The container labyrinth functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (gap no wider than shoulders, gantry climb) and charges the closure image ("whispers echo longer in steel canyons"). Sensory details are selective and urgent—tarnished coin warmth, sodium-lamp flicker—filtered through Lena’s professional bias. Recurring objects (coin, map) evolve causally to reweight the final moment, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth’s quiet power vs. shouted authority—is signaled early and tightens through Lena’s agency: the coin’s weight guides her, the map enables access, and her choice to pass evidence forecloses confrontation. Escalation via Accumulative/Textural density (storm, whispers, Libra symbol) reweights stakes until Delgado’s confession carries conceptual cost. No redundant loops; pressure coheres to a single deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: the coin-key opening "ears," not doors, and refolded maps as evidence reweight "whispers travel farther than shouts" without moralizing. Final line’s "steel canyons" resonance avoids tidy binaries, embracing complexity (truth topples empires silently). No thematic echo; subtext operates in Lena’s silence and Delgado’s unheard shouts, inviting reflection through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("reads time in sway of containers," gaits as narratives) shapes every observation. Rhythmic control modulates under pressure—short sentences for tension ("Nothing happened"), lyrical cadence for reflection ("soft as falling ash"). Voice remains stable in lexicon and psychic distance; no head-hopping. Compression (storm’s static dissolving footfalls) is taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion ("zodiac coin—half-buried... humming with residual warmth"). Sentence rhythm varies naturally (long opening clause, staccato beats at Sector Theta), avoiding drumbeat monotony. Figurative language is sparse yet precise ("murmured doubt could topple empires"), with no register drift. Final line’s "steel canyons" recharges motifs without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesizing port tropes: the labyrinth-worker premise transforms shipping containers into a character-specific pressure chamber, while "key with no lock" reconfigures spy-genre clichés through Lena’s quiet agency. Emotional truth in her competence/flaw balance (storm disrupts her skill) avoids safety-hedging. Risk-taking (no confrontation, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
