<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in alchemist’s embodied restraint ("didn’t flinch") versus fierce curiosity; Elias’ soot-streaked tears externalize guilt without therapy-speak. Final choice—transforming guilt into pigment—earns closure via prior causality (revaluing currencies of light).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands impeccably: shell transfer crystallizes options (burden/bridge) with visceral cost (tears on soot). Accumulative lens holds through density escalation—ember glow deepening to molten crimson then amber mirrors emotional reweighting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Nautilus shell constrains every key choice: palette source, grounding device, alchemical vessel. Final image ("pocket-sun humming against ribs") charges closure by evolving from "spiral whispering" to active compositional tool, reweighting prior motifs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guilt as story-ending weight) tightens via Elias’ whispered secret, narrowing options to transformation or rupture. Cost is undeniable: tears tracking "clean paths through soot" as physical manifestation of emotional purification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through "revaluation" motif: "presence isn’t passive—it’s chosen. Again and again." Final image (painting "next chapter together") offers resonant non-literal answer—guilt as pigment—without moralizing, reweighting "currencies of light" with earned complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: alchemist notices "hues no prism could replicate" while Elias’ "scuffed boots" reveal pacing anxiety. Voice modulates from scientific ("logarithmic perfection") to lyrical ("liquid starlight") without register drift under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in opening ("spiral whispering of logarithmic perfection") slightly dulls immediacy, but "bruised indigo/ghost of green" achieves high density. Zero loops; final line’s "composing the next equation" avoids closure muddle with crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms alchemy tropes through "scientifically romantic" lens: logarithmic shells measure "density of presence." Risk-taking (guilt as pigment) heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity ("columella curl") makes emotional calculus feel freshly inevitable.</comment>
