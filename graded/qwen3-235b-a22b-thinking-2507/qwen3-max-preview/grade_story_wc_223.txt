<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in concrete gestures (baker weighing flour, child bowing) avoids therapy-speak; contradictory impulses act simultaneously as crisis actor documents truth while unbinding from performance. Final choice to spell "listen" for sovereign earned by prior causality with conceptual cost of pawns' permanent absence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing where "interregnum was not emptiness, but incubation" reweights history's engine with undeniable cost ("missing pawns? They were never meant to return"). Accumulative lens holds—each added survivor deepens gesture-archive pressure toward sovereign confrontation without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Whispering gallery’s acoustics actively constrain choices (echoes dissolving chains), while pawnless chessboard functions as micro-setting charging closure when placed before sovereign. Final penumbra pooling at feet recharges "luminous absence" with environmental consequence, meeting 9+ gate through object-driven tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when widow’s unbinding gesture forecloses performance-as-survival path, forcing protagonist’s shift to "historian for presence." Escalation driven by protagonist’s agency (walking patterns summoning others) with conceptual cost legible in "absence was the point," though internal/external conflict interweaving lacks depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Final image ("luminous absence of all small gestures that held world together") offers resonant non-literal answer to central question without moralizing. Theme emerges purely through embodied particulars (ring on chessboard = unbinding), avoiding Thematic Echo despite profound lines by anchoring insight in action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature evident in "silences shaped like breaths" and compression under stress ("placed... began my walk"). Purposeful patterned diction taught early (chessboard refrains) pays off in closure, though "benevolently ruthless" slightly drifts from POV lexicon in peak beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "penumbra thickened, not with darkness, but with clarity that hurt" advances theme, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Rhythm varies organically from reflective ("It was a relic...") to staccato ("They watched me walk"), with no figurative muddle in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms "whispering gallery" trope into active archive of gestures; "historian of small gestures" premise feels fresh through concrete cultural logic (pawnless chessboard = spent common lives). Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, scoring +0.3 risk distinction.</comment>
