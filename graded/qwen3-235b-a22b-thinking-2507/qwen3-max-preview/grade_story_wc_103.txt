<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority masterfully embodied through sensory metaphors ("grief was coarse"); micro-choices like photograph abandonment earn renunciation. Lacks secondary character dynamics but unnecessary for single-POV scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance with visceral cost (photos disintegrating); Accumulative lens holds through sensory density buildup. Orientation clear by "moss-slicked arches" opening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Living bridge garden functions as micro-setting charging final image (tears sprouting silver flowers); hyperbolic geometry constrains choices. Body/tool integration elevates beyond atmospheric description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Dominant stake (texture of time) tightens through disintegration event; cost legible in vanished photographs. Single escalation suffices but abstract stakes slightly diffuse pressure early.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete sensory reweighting ("joy, unexpectedly porous"); final image answers central question without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite lyrical density.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("fingertips brushing leaves that pulsed like veins") controls focalization; rhythmic variation mirrors temporal distortion. Zero head-hopping despite complex interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion flawless except "thrumming like a plucked nerve" risks mixed metaphor; no loops but high-pressure beats lean slightly purple. Final image retains clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Time-as-texture synthesis feels inevitable; transforms tropes through horticultural specificity. Risk-taking (hyperbolic geometry as emotional lexicon) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
