<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara’s "desperately jocular" trait manifests in her spiced tea ritual and softening genuineness, with micro-choices like unwrapping the rock showing contradictory impulses (logistician control vs. emotional risk). Secondary characters apply immediate pressure through traded stories, but Mrs. Hargrove lacks distinct voice. Cost is embodied in the man’s dust-streaked tears.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the stone’s mundane warmth after the man’s confession crystallizes reciprocity’s cost (his trembling ceasing). Orientation is anchored instantly by the ivy-draped station. Accumulative lens holds through density of story exchanges, though moon rock rumors slightly abstract the escalation. Cost is visceral in "tears streaking through dust."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The disused station actively pressures choices: ivy shapes "polite anarchy," Platform 3 constrains Elara’s setup, and the moon rock’s coolness charges the climax. Final image of "rustle of ivy in wind that smelled like rain" reweights abandonment into possibility. Could deepen sensory constraints on tactics (e.g., how rusted rails limit movement).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (curing loneliness via reciprocity) tightens through Elara’s agency: her "Tell me, and I’ll tell you mine after" forces mutual vulnerability. Cost is felt in the man’s hospital vigils and canned-goods birthdays, altering tactics when he accepts warmth. Rumored moon rock properties slightly dilute causal pressure, but the man’s trembling cessation proves earned trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: Haitian starfish constellations, Nepalese grief-singing, deaf painter translating recipes. Final image of "warmth, transferred, reciprocal, real" answers the central question without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by having the stone *not* magically crack—truth lives in "Me too" moments. No abstract statements mar the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elara’s logistician eye notices "thermoses and mismatched mugs," her philosophical side frames "symbols rearrange human hearts." Rhythmic control shifts from lyrical ("draped in ivy like a forgotten cathedral") to sparse dialogue under pressure. Moon rock’s "lunar loneliness" edges toward thematic abstraction but remains voice-coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose avoids loops with varied syntax ("boots crunching on gravel and brittle leaves" → "world tilted just enough to let light in"). High density: "folding table near Platform 3" conveys setting and stakes. Minor deduction for "rumored to pulse with lunar loneliness"—slight thematic echo in a high-pressure beat, but redeemed by later disavowal of magic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "loneliness cure" trope through disaster-relief logistics: reciprocity as operational rule, moon rock as catalytic symbol. Fresh inflection in "polite anarchy" framing and deaf painter translating recipes into brushstrokes. Avoids safety-middle by making the rock’s magic explicitly false yet meaningful. Risks pay off without gimmickry.</comment>
