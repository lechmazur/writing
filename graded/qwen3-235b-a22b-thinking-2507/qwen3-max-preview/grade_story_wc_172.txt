<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "amoral philanthropist" vs. secret sentimentality; micro-choice of placing (not burying) the egg reveals value hierarchy. Slight flaw: mother backstory feels convenient rather than altering present stance via on-page choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is flawless Charged Poise—"felt clean" crystallizes stance with undeniable cost. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds from opening imagery to fading echo. Minor deduction: map mechanics lack causal grounding in the ritual’s resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Salt flat as micro-setting constrains every choice—kneeling on "cracked earth," salt "crunching like shattered glass." Final image ("salt flat held its breath") directly charges closure. Egg’s iridescence and dimming fulfill 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("preserve echo" vs. legacy of silence) tightens through density increase—the glowing cracks narrow options to pure resonance. Cost is unmistakable: "let it carve its hollow melody into his ribs." Slight deduction for drought’s creation feeling distant from present pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action, not statement: "echo was enough" reweights extinction without moralizing. Final image ("ghost of a bird’s song clinging to his collar") answers central question with earned resonance. "Fractured grace" phrase borders on thematic echo but avoids explicit moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: "mineral crust," "thunder like lullaby." Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure—staccato for ritual ("He didn’t bury it. He didn’t smash it."), lyrical for release. Single hairline slip: "amoral philanthropist" label slightly tell-y despite immediate demonstration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "salt crunching like shattered glass" exemplifies textural specificity. Final line ("ghost of a bird’s song... like perfume") achieves propulsion without overwriting. Minor deduction for "trembling trill that sounded like wind through crystal reeds" slightly muddling the vehicle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "guilty billionaire" trope through "preserving echoes not life" specificity. Salt flat as sacred ground for manufactured drought is fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Slight deduction: core premise remains recognizable despite brilliant execution, missing full 9.5 risk distinction.</comment>
