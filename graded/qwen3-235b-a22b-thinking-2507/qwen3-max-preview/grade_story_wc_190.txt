<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Operator’s micro-choices (exhaling, shifting weight) reveal contradictory impulses under pressure; passenger’s embodied grief avoids therapy-speak. Final renunciation of words earns closure through prior causality with visible cost in "shoulders dropped half an inch."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "tear without shame" crystallizes stakes with felt cost. Accumulative lens holds throughout; orientation clear within 120 words via prism terrace/storm glass. Cost proof evident in physical release preceding storm glass’s "clear as mountain air."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prism terrace actively constrains choices (thermal drafts move gondola; tiles hum in response). Storm glass functions as micro-setting charging closure—its "warm, golden, complete" pulse reweights the final image beyond atmospheric decoration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>One dominant stake (silence as vessel) deepens through textural escalation: woman’s "dense fog" shifting to "silver eddies" narrows options under Accumulative lens. Cost legible in her physical unraveling ("fingers loosened," tear "without shame"), driven by operator’s agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "silence as presence" crystallized by the tear tracing "without shame" and storm glass’s clarity. Final image reweights premise without moralizing—no thematic echo, only earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("brittle snap of anxiety," "subsonic lullaby") modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control evident in vial’s "coiled and uncoiled" spirals; no head-hopping. Single-POV stability amplifies emotional precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion ("gondola tilted toward chime-trees"). Figurative language serves pressure ("dense fog—gray, heavy, unmoving") without muddle. Final line’s "The work continued" resolves with perfect cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence as active comfort via storm glass mechanics avoids abstraction. Emotional specificity in "knuckles white, jaw clenched" transforms situational trope. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry—conceptual integrity holds through closure.</comment>
