<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when she "winnows deeper, separating grief from guilt" amid embodied trembling—no therapy-speak, only chess-player precision dissecting her own unraveling. Final renunciation ("carry it lightly") earned by tapestry work with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: fog absorbing "I see you" then dissolving into acceptance reconfigures meaning with visceral cost in her recognition tremor. Accumulative lens holds as woven hush intensifies pressure toward crystallized stance without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Platinum labyrinth constrains every choice—walls soften only as she decodes threads, and final rain "coaxes seeds from stubborn soil" charges the ending image. Sensory hierarchy flawless: chess tutor notices tension in frayed threads, not generic village details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (self-forgiveness) tightens through her winnowing—each thread decoded narrows escape routes until mirror confrontation. Agency drives escalation: her choices reknit tapestries, forcing irreversible stance crystallization with felt cost in trembling hands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from tapestry threads reknit "stronger at broken places," rejecting tidy morals. Final image answers central question: mistakes "learn to breathe" without stating a moral, earned through baker’s regret and unsent letters woven into action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "fingers fidgeted productively—brushing dust... tracing air as if resetting invisible pieces." Rhythm modulates perfectly: staccato during tension ("She entered."), flowing cadence in resolution. Zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops—every sentence propels story ("Leaves stirred. A dropped coin clinked."). Only microscopic flaw: "woven hush" repetition risks density in high-pressure beat, but payoff in tapestry sigh justifies it. Final line’s "carry it lightly" epitomizes earned concision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms self-forgiveness trope via chess tutor’s gambit mindset—labyrinth as "feints, sacrifices" makes emotional arc inseparable from profession. Risk-taking (frozen time) heightens stakes: rain’s return charges closure without gimmickry. Freshness in baker’s regret as lived detail.</comment>
