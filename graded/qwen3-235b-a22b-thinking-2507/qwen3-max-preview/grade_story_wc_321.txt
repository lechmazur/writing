<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation crystallizes cleanly but lacks deeper internal contradiction; resilience reads as trait not struggle. "Grinned while scrubbing" embodies emotion yet avoids layered conflict beyond surface positivity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with resonant Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "knew timelines would fray again" but conceptual weight slightly undercuts visceral impact at convergence climax.</comment>
