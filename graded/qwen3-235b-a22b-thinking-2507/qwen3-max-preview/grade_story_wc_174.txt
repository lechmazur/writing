<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("veneer for moral evasion") and embodied micro-choices (sweeping glass with brush) earn change; Mira's absence limits relationship pressure but calligrapher's self-puppet crystallizes internal conflict with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "serenity wasn’t cultivated—it was earned" reconfigures moral evasion into accountability through the stick’s "charred lines," fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens with cosmic hush intensifying pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Radar dome’s "skeletal ribs" and story stick constrain choice (puppet-building materials) and charge closure; "rivets into eyes" projection during candlelit rehearsal shows environment mirroring internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through puppet-show consequences (beer bottle incident), narrowing options toward accountability; cost legible in "turning embers into light," though "heated argument" timeframe lacks live-clock pressure beyond atmospheric hush.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Final image ("story wasn’t over... finally being told right") offers non-literal answer to ethical storytelling, avoiding moralizing; "illuminating who lit the match" reweights theme through prior particulars (villains weeping, poison as calligraphy).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in textural details ("velvet fog," "Morse code from ghosts"); rhythmic control under pressure via fragmented clauses during epiphany ("characters whispered... endings unraveled") with no head-hopping in single POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops but near-miss thematic echo ("aestheticizing harm") risks diagnostic label-speak; "cosmic pulses" slightly overwrites, yet "shattered mirror eyes" and "blood and honey" maintain concrete propulsion through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Cold War tech with Navajo wisdom transforms ethical storytelling trope; "subversive puppet shows" avoid gimmickry by charging every beat (veteran’s bottle, recycled manuscripts) with authentic stakes.</comment>
