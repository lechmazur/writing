<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; "regret, hope, or unresolved grief sings a frequency" shows embodied contradiction. Final choice earned by childhood crossroads vision, but mother's backstory reflection slightly over-abstracts the cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: bunker collapse + "You were always the path" reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost ("surrender to forest"). Orientation clear by word 20; Accumulative lens (density shift in dream visions) holds through final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vine-draped bunker functions as micro-setting: roots swallow structure, altering outcome. Wafer seal constrains choices (avoiding alarms, dream-trigger), charges final image as "newborn bird." Sensory details reflect urgency ("boots clicked against corroded grates").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (why paths choose walkers) tightens via dream-state escalation. Cost legible in bunker's collapse as conceptual surrender, but storm's role remains atmospheric rather than pressuring tactics despite "punctuation" metaphor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "wafer seal dissolving into honey then obsidian" and "roots softening steel," avoiding moralizing. Final image ("walkers become the road") reweights pathwalker paradox without stating morals, though "regret/hope/grief" phrasing edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "symbols bled meaning" filters reality through dream logic. Rhythm modulates perfectly—"half-dance, half-defiance" under stress—without syntactic monotony. No head-hopping in single-POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; "honey to obsidian" metaphor deepens closure. "Precisely playful step" avoids overwriting by serving action. Slight density risk in "pulse with scent of damp moss and rusted steel" compensated by later tactile economy ("brushing soil from her knees").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Synthesizes military AI decay with pathwalker philosophy into fresh emotional logic. "Paths choose walkers when essence resonates with hidden architecture" transforms trope through specific embodied stakes, avoiding derivative "chosen one" narratives.</comment>
