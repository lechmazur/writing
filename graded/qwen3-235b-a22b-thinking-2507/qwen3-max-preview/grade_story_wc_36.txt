<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "harvest insights from failure" motivation; embodied precision ("fingers trembled not from fear but from precision") avoids therapy-speak. Minor flaw: "hollow eyes of abandoned realms" edges toward stock imagery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("some collapses are necessary"); Accumulative lens holds via density increase in realm collapses. Orientation clear by 40 words; no causality breaks despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Driftwood markers constrain choice (calibrated to "wind’s memory"), charging final image. Sensory specificity ("silence so dense it pressed against eardrums") reflects urgency without checklist. Environment actively shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist’s agency: each realm’s collapse reveals distinct failure mode. Cost crystallizes in "let failures be honored" with visible consequence (flute abandoned). One tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: Verdantis/Silmara/Khyren collapses avoid moralizing. Final image ("doors stay open by staying closed") reweights premise without stating moral. No thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature evident in geomantic lexicon ("harmonic node," "resonance against leylines"). Rhythmic control under pressure ("thin as spider silk, and the world flickered"). Zero head-hopping; voice modulates with intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffolding; "avalanchingly quiet" and "spider silk" similes avoid cliché through context. One paraphrase loop ("recording not what was lost, but how it unraveled") prevents 9.2. Propulsion flawless in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms relic trope via "keeper of thresholds" premise. Specificity anchors universals: "handwritten regrets" on flute avoids quirkiness. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
