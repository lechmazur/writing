<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via embodied taste method (copper/ozone/honey), but the storm-carrier's underdeveloped motivation weakens secondary pressure. Final shift to trust earns cost through relinquishing the compass ring, though his "archive" rationale lacks prior contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "taste earth now" crystallizes surrender with visible cost (ring pocketed), under Accumulative lens. Orientation anchors within 120 words; aurora’s pulse and soil contact sustain causal pressure toward convergence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lavender bluff constrains choices (soil contact for tasting) and charges closure ("lavender swayed, forgetting storm"). Micro-setting (taste method) directly alters tactics—copper prompts movement, ozone confirms position—fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via sensory escalation (copper→ozone→honey), narrowing options to convergence. Cost is unmistakable: skeptic’s "luminous skepticism" surrenders to trust as ring spins down, reweighting agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "terrestrially cosmic" reprise in final line—"carry less, taste more"—avoiding moralizing. Forest elections embody cosmic stewardship; honey taste offers non-literal answer to "why carry weather" without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("taste changed with proximity") modulates under pressure; rhythm shifts from lyrical ("pulsed like celestial heartbeat") to staccato ("copper. ozone. honey.") during convergence. Zero head-hopping in single-POV frame.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "honey—thick, golden, impossible" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Final image ("walked into the dawn humming with terrestrially cosmic grace") avoids figurative muddle while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ecological elections and personal weather transforms tropes; "taste-based navigation" feels inevitable. Risk-taking (mycelial democracy) heightens stakes without gimmickry, fulfilling 9+ quick test.</comment>
