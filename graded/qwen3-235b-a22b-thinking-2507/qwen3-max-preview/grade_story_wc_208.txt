<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority shines through embodied contradictions (salt-crusted boots vs. critics’ pressure), but the final renunciation lacks visceral cost—her walk inland feels unearned without showing sacrifice of deadlines or monetization struggles.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: villagers’ ritualized lantern-lighting crystallizes the cost of modern disconnection. The "Simplicity is architecture" whisper reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost, though the storm’s dimming slightly strains causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Storm-tossed archway constrains every choice (carving in wet sand, lantern against gale) and charges the final image—projected hands on cliffs. Micro-setting (waterlogged plank) forces surrender to driftwood’s resistance, embodying the theme physically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly: GPS failure → artistic crisis → timewoven revelation. But Elara’s internal/external conflict (deadlines vs. legacy) lacks tangible cost—her choice to walk inland avoids showing what she forfeits (e.g., gallery deadlines).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically through "hands" motif, culminating in the non-literal answer: "light passed hand to hand." Avoids moralizing, but "Simplicity is architecture" borders on thematic echo—saved by being marrow-deep, not stated outright.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: "turbine-hum reverie" filters every detail through Elara’s sculptor’s senses. Rhythmic control under pressure ("rain needled... wind tugged") mirrors her meditative carving, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "salt-crusted boots," "waterlogged plank" show via concrete texture. Minor deduction: "turbine-hum" repetition risks thematic overstatement, though payoff justifies it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "art saves the world" trope via specific, verifiable detail (salvaged projector, drowned lighthouse chest). Risk-taking (lyric time-weaving) heightens stakes without gimmickry—the villagers’ ritual feels inevitable.</comment>
