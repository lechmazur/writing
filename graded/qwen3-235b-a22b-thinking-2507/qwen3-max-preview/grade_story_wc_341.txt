<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "quietly explosive" embodied through unsaid words and frayed cloud edges, but husband remains abstract despite pivotal backstory. Micro-choices in cloud classification reveal value hierarchy with salt-stained ledger as perfect pressure point.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "smiled—not because the pain was gone, but because she’d proven... empty spaces remember" crystallizes stance with felt cost. Accumulative lens holds through spooled wholeness pattern; Altocumulus #112 dissolution tightens options via atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Brass telescope constrains every choice—from adjusting aperture to cradling as relic—and charges the final image. "Powdered memory" starlight and coffee-stained ledger integrate tactile specificity that mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving emptiness remembers) tightens through cloud classifications; #112’s dissolution forces memorialization as renunciation of doubt. Cost is visceral in "scent of pine and unfinished conversations," though secondary conflict with colleagues lacks on-page escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through cloud epitaphs ("furious love," "resigned acceptance") with final image reframing "courage" as categorizing absence. Avoids moralizing via concrete stakes—Altocumulus #112’s dissolution proves memory’s persistence without abstract claims.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful: clouds filtered through grief ("cumulus as grief"), telescope absorbing sky’s secrets. Rhythmic control under pressure ("frayed, the fragmented, the floating") with no head-hopping; lyric compression taught immediately via "spooled wholeness."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-perfect propulsion, but "frayed, the fragmented, the floating" slightly loops cadence. Figurative language ("sky wept in patterns") remains precise in peak beats; "charcoal pencil worn to a nub" exemplifies textural specificity that charges closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via meteorological precision—clouds as emotional archives. "Spooled wholeness" synthesizes science and sorrow into fresh premise; the gondola’s "fraying cables" mirror frayed memories without cliché. Risk-taking elevates stakes coherently.</comment>
