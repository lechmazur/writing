<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in reimagined dialogues versus lived trauma, but "gloomy cheerfulness" risks thematic echo; micro-choices like shell-to-cello transfer reveal value hierarchy, though competence slightly overshadows struggle in climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands flawlessly when compass points "straight down" to "core of her own silence," with undeniable cost in shattered compass and cracked shell; Accumulative lens holds through vibrational density escalation without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Observatory setting provides atmospheric pressure (wind, shattered glass) but lacks causal constraint on choices; micro-setting of cello soundboard charging the shell elevates specificity, though cliff location remains postcard-like without tactical impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through cello’s hums narrowing emotional options to the devastating CR; protagonist’s agency in retelling dialogues directly forces the cost of shattered compass and cracked shell, with "core of her own silence" crystallizing the irreversible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from shell/cello mechanics to "What do you bury when you refuse to speak?"—no moralizing, only resonant closure in "lullaby for riddles she’d learned to live beside"; avoids sentimentality through embodied cost of humming shell fragments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels in sound-centric noticing ("resonant hums," "cracked bells"), but "ephemeral compass" slightly verges on thematic convenience; rhythmic control sustains pressure through fragmented cadence during climax without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "wind howling through cracked domes like a choir of forgotten astronomers" exemplifies purposeful density, though "reimagined past conversations—dialogues rewritten by longing" edges toward abstraction without immediate tactile grounding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope via cello vibrations as emotional compass; "core of her own silence" reconfiguration feels inevitable yet fresh, avoiding derivative safety with bold stakes in "refuse to speak" moral calculus that reshapes the premise.</comment>
