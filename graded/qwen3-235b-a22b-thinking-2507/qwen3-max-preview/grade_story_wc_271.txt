<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied trauma ("phantom twinges," "salty air tastes like gunpowder") avoiding therapy-speak; contradictory impulses (seeking calibration vs. resisting healing) culminate in earned micro-choice to stop counting tears, with visible cost in the tear scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: "carry the pearl... in my pulse" crystallizes stance with visceral cost ("cry without counting tears"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory accumulation to dewdrop epiphany, reconfiguring stillness as "the eye within chaos."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Body functions as micro-setting (barefoot grounding, somatic markers) constraining choices; final image charged by recurring objects (photo’s weight shift, spiderweb dewdrop) that reweight trauma into compass-like guidance without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("anchor optimism in realism") tightens through protagonist’s agency in choosing witness over escape; escalation via sensory deepening (freeze moment) narrows options to "holding coexistence of ruin and regrowth," with unmistakable cost in uncounted tears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (moss spirals, spiderweb pearls), avoiding moralizing; final image ("stillness is not absence of chaos but the eye within it") offers resonant non-literal answer to central question, reweighting trauma via pulse metaphor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("paper fibers memorized tremors," "salty air tastes like gunpowder") modulates rhythm under pressure (freeze’s suspended syntax); voice remains consistent without clinical drift despite "somatic markers" near-clinical phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("phantom twinges flare when storms brew") with clear propulsion; metaphors coherent (pearl/shell) even in peak beats, though "quietly talented" slightly abstract but redeemed by immediate action ("draw gnarled roots").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms trauma tropes via somatic lens: "pearl of stillness" avoids cliché through concrete execution (dewdrop→pulse); risk-taking in quiet climax pays off with emotional specificity ("tears without counting"), resisting safety-middle abstraction.</comment>
