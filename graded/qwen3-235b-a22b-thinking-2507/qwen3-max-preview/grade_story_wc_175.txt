<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "transiently rooted" paradox and deliberate knots that suggest pauses rather than security; micro-choices like not touching the monarch reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost in the indentation left behind.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the unraveling shrine’s "indentation in moss" crystallizes earned cost of impermanence, with lens (Accumulative/Textural) held through density of ritual actions culminating in the monarch’s silent benediction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Verdant grotto functions as micro-setting—moss, lichen, and dew-slick stone constrain her ritual, charging the final image where rain "loosen[s] the knots" and wind "scatter[s] the threads," making environment indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens: pressure tightens through ritual density (knotting, breathing, stillness) until the monarch’s descent forces crystallization of stance—honoring vanishing without claiming it—making the felt cost of impermanence undeniable in the "indentation."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the shrine’s dissolution reweights "overlooked histories" not as moral but as iridescent ghost-wings in moss, with the final line’s "grotto blushed deeper" offering resonant non-literal answer to honoring vanishing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exquisite—"light filtering gold-green," "ferns curling inward as if shy"—with rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping, and compression ("village elders... voices thin as dried petals") taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion but minor overwriting in "velvet dark of collective amnesia" slightly dulls closure’s physical immediacy; otherwise, zero loops, high density, and precise verbs ("threading vine through root") elevate tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms elegy trope through specific, grounded ritual—knots as "pauses" not security, moth wing as "relic of nocturnal grace"—with the risk of lyrical compression paying off in closure’s "indentation," avoiding abstraction while feeling inevitable.</comment>
