<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in reverence-vs-fear hesitation before the door; embodied emotion via mapping shame "without judgment, only geometry." Slight abstraction in "frequency of honesty" prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "she was remade. And in her pocket...a single silver needle—warm, humming, waiting." Accumulative lens holds with cost legible in "pavement whole—but she was not." Flawless escalation via arrow multiplication.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Starlit vault functions as micro-setting that charges the final image ("threshold," "bruised dawn"); phantom punch evolves from tool to key to dissolved artifact. Minor overwriting in "starlight pooled like liquid mercury" prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the dare: "unraveling mysteries was her vocation, but this one would unravel her." Cost is unmistakable in "she was remade," though mystical escalation slightly edges past pure protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the pavement arrows' meaning shift: "they didn’t point to secrets. They pointed to readiness." Final image reweights the premise without moralizing. Near-miss for 9.5 due to faint "hour divides bad habits" abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in mapper's lexicon ("sketched paths like symphonies," "emotional triangulation"). Rhythmic control peaks in the dissolution sequence. Slight register drift in "resonance, a frequency of honesty" prevents 9.5.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion via concrete verbs ("crawled," "vibrated," "shattered"). "Mist clung like regret" avoids cliché through character-specific perception. One borderline overwritten phrase ("starlight pooled in hollows like liquid mercury") costs 0.1.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of route-mapping profession with truth-seeking; "mapped her shame as deftly as sewer tunnels" transforms tropes. Risk-taking in making truth a chorus elevates stakes. Falls just short of 9.5 due to faint echoes of mythic quest frameworks.</comment>
