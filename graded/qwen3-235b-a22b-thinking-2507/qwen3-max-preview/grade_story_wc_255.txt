<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s colorblindness drives his texture-based perception and micro-choices (e.g., arranging plants by stem stiffness), but Marta’s sudden shift from amused observer to student lacks sufficient friction; her recognition feels earned yet the "innocently cunning" spark reappears too neatly without deeper struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: Marta’s "we wake the kiln" crystallizes the courtyard’s awakened pulse with conceptual cost (trading perfection for ruined beauty), though the Accumulative/Textural lens slightly obscures early stake escalation beyond atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The reed tongue and courtyard flora actively constrain choices—wedging the reed triggers the dew-filled birdbath—and the final hum charges the closure image; sensory details (moss’s "damp velvet," maple’s "brittle crackle") are purposefully filtered through Elias’s POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elias’s plant arrangements altering the courtyard’s behavior, but the dominant conflict (finding beauty in brokenness) lacks tangible opposition beyond Marta’s initial skepticism; the cost—trading honey for "soul-stuff"—feels abstract rather than viscerally paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Elias’s actions: the reed’s hum and Marta’s sunflower arrangement reweight "ruined" as resonant, avoiding moralizing; the final line ("bartered awakenings traded not for perfection") offers a non-literal answer through concrete action, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in Elias’s texture-driven narration ("red the brittle crackle of autumn maple"), though Marta’s dialogue ("Teach me") risks thematic echo; rhythmic control sustains tension during the reed’s activation ("rosemary twitched... ivy uncurled").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops and high density ("ash-patterns on the east wall and a silence thick with rebirth"), but "fiercer than wonder: recognition" slightly elevates diction beyond Elias’s lexicon; final image ("courtyard hummed in agreement") avoids closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via specific synthesis: colorblindness reframes beauty as resonance, and "bartered awakenings" feels inevitable through honey/lullaby trades; risks poetic structure yet maintains clarity, with Marta’s sunflower arrangement delivering a fresh inflection.</comment>
