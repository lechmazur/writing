<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "She hadn’t come to fix. She’d come to listen," earned by tactile micro-choices (gloved fingers brushing relic, jamming arrow into fissure). Slight deduction for epiphany feeling compressed without sufficient struggle preceding the shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "the song lingered" crystallizes options with cost (abandoning fixing/harvesting for listening), under Accumulative/Textural lens. Archive mention risks expositional drift but is anchored by present action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orchard planet constrains every choice (inversion window, dew-trail navigation) and charges closure: "arrow tip...glowed steady — no longer broken, but rooted." Moss-draped shelf that "an hour ago, had been ceiling" exemplifies lived-in specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Temporal pressure of gravity inversion ("minutes" left) narrows options, driving the deepening where agency (jamming arrow into tree) transforms stakes. Cost is undeniable: "not to pilot... but to echo with it" forecloses her prior identity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: arrow’s transformation (broken→rooted) embodies "resilience is recalled." Final image ("to echo with it") reweights premise without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo via sensory integration ("song vibrated in Elira’s bones").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: notices "water flow," "scent of nectar-thick air." Rhythm modulates perfectly under stress ("Not fruit, not leaf. Metal.") with zero head-hopping. Syntactic compression during crisis ("She banked hard, skimmed...") heightens pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; "whirling silence that pressed against her eardrums like deep-space vacuum" shows density without muddle. Slight deduction for "bio-harmonic convergence" bordering on jargon, but justified by archive context and never repeated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orchard planet’s gravity inversion transforms familiar tropes: resilience as memory ("the orchard remembered every storm") feels inevitable through specific mechanics (dew-trails, echo-anchors). Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
