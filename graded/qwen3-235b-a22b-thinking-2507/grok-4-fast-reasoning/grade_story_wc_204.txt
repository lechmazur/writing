<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to compress eternity drives every choice, with embodied emotion in "trembling fingers" uncorking the vial. Lacks contradictory impulses under pressure—no hesitation or internal conflict during the pivotal rupture despite centuries of equilibrium.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the library achieves "timeless stasis" with visible cost ("fragments of frost-laced panes rained into the abyss"). Lens holds as Accumulative/Textural, but the cost proof test barely clears with "infinite weight of untold stories pressing into one resonant moment" feeling slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The glass orchard setting constrains choices (frost patterns guide discovery) and charges the final image ("glass remnants gleamed eternally"). Micro-setting mastery: crystalline branches and ink-stained hands directly shape Elias's tactics and the rupture's progression.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through accumulating sensory pressure ("rustling awakenings intensified") under the Accumulative lens. Agency is clear but the cost—systemic collapse—lacks personal sacrifice; Elias achieves his goal without meaningful forfeiture beyond the library's destruction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the bottled whisper's destabilization, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("captured essence of all time") reweights eternity as stasis, not triumph, but "destabilized perfection" risks thematic echo in the last line, slightly muddying resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices "filigrees like forgotten scripts" and "papery sigh" of the whisper. Rhythmic control peaks in the rupture sequence ("pages fluttered open unbidden, illustrations animated"), with no head-hopping in this single-POV piece.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops in closure beats, but "whispers in the wind" is a cliché and "trembling as if breathing" slightly overwrites. Final image ("frost's patterns immortalized in ink") achieves crystalline propulsion, though minor artifacts prevent 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of "letterpress operator compressing time" feels inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "bottled whisper" edges close to familiar magical-object tropes despite transformative execution.</comment>
