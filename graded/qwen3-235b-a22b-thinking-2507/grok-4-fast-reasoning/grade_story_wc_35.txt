<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (craving connection vs. fearing emotional overload), but transformation lacks visible cost—absorbing centuries of remorse requires no tangible sacrifice, making endurance feel unearned despite strong embodied details like "sand in a wound."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis works (refined memories foreclose haunting), but cost remains abstract—"sturdy yet no longer brittle" tells rather than shows the price paid, failing the cost proof test for 9.0 despite the Accumulative lens holding through the coral pavilion climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: rainwater pools guide Elara’s discovery, and the coral pavilion’s ice directly constrains her absorption ritual; bioluminescent veins charging the final image ("desert fortress gleaming anew") perfectly reweights the "brittle" motif with environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from "remorse that threatened to crack her" to absorbing orbs, but the cost lacks concreteness—no tradeoff (e.g., lost time, energy, or part of herself) alters tactics during the climax, weakening the pressure under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "sandpapering rough memories," with the coral pavilion’s orbs offering non-literal resolution; avoids moralizing despite the slight thematic echo in "heal rather than haunt," which barely skirts final-paragraph sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tasting memories," reading pools "like broth") deepens under stress, with rhythmic compression during the digging sequence; psychic distance tightens flawlessly as she enters the pavilion, avoiding any head-hopping in this single-POV piece.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion stumbles only in peak beats: "brittle" repeats three times (ground/memory/resolution), and "remorse flooded her—flashes..." slightly abstracts the absorption, though vivid verbs like "grinding away jagged regrets" maintain density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chef-as-memory-taster with desert magic realism elevates tropes; coral pavilion beneath dunes transforms "stored remorse" into visceral stakes, though orbs feel familiar—specificity in tidal pool analysis and sandpaper metaphor saves it from derivative territory.</comment>
