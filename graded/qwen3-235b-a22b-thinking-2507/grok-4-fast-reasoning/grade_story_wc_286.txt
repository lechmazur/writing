<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion ("zen breath evening out the tremor") and micro-choices under pressure, but lacks contradictory impulses—Elias consistently phototropes toward kindness without internal struggle, weakening the flaw-driven causality required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable cost ("understanding was not possession, but a gentle release"), but lens ambiguity at midpoint (Accumulative vs. Causal) prevents 8.8+; orientation is solidly anchored within 120 words by "dunes of ash" and "chimney smoke."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting (lantern glass) constrains choices and charges the final image ("vibration fading into soil"), with sensory details like "thorny blooms" reflecting urgency; only deduction for slight overwriting in "crumbling hives like ancient sentinels."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resistance through kindness) is signaled early and deepens through visions, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the thrumming visions happen *to* Elias rather than arising from his choices, missing the band guardrail for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars ("roots delve deep enough to hold the light"), avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights the premise with conceptual cost (kindness as active resistance), satisfying the 9+ quick test without stated morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sun patterns mapped a path like veins") and rhythmic control excel, but "phototropic to kindness" breaks POV plausibility as botanical jargon forced into emotional metaphor during peak pressure, triggering a -0.4 flaw.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with high density ("visions fractured the air around him: timelines splintering like cracked pottery"), but minor synonym loops in "thrumming" descriptions (repeated 3x with slight variation) prevent 9.0 despite no closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic tropes through beekeeping pottery metaphors, but "phototropic" metaphor feels derivative; risk-taking in fractured timelines earns +0.3, though not quite hitting the 9+ quick test's inevitability.</comment>
