<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "logically emotional precision" vs "protective fervor," but motivation lacks personal stakes beyond duty; crypt keeper's warning feels externally imposed rather than organically earned through Elias's history.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: ice stabilization shows cost via fading key glow and Elias's drained state. Causal lens holds perfectly—"vibrational matching" creates direct cause/effect chain with no coincidences resolving threat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Drift ice actively constrains choices (emitting "mismatched vibrations" requiring counter-frequencies) and charges final image as "prismatic halos." Sensory details like "lap of waves like hesitant breaths" evolve with plot pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully as ice encroaches, forcing Elias to adapt his engineering skills. Cost is visible in physical exhaustion and depleted key, but sunset timeframe lacks mechanical urgency—time pressure is atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "sonic absolution" reweights chaos into harmony without moralizing. Final image of stabilized ice charged with prismatic halos offers resonant answer to "fleshly ethereal" tension, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature evident in engineer's frequency-focused noticing ("ice's fractures emitted low, rumbling frequencies"), but phrases like "fleshly shiver rippled into ethereal awareness" risk overwriting and register drift in peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Filter-verb cluster in climax ("Elias knew he must act, adapting...") dulls immediacy. Overwritten phrases ("nomadic ghosts," "fleshly ethereal") occasionally muddle propulsion, though final image's clarity salvages closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of engineering physics with mystical artifact avoids cliché; "vibrational matching" transforms trope through tactile specificity. Risk-taking in blending logic/emotion elevates stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
