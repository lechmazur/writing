<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("cheerful gloom") embodied through micro-choices with glass/seeds; flaws drive inevitable dissolution of paths. Final renunciation of permanence earns cost through vine withering imagery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orientation clear by line 5; closure is Earned Stasis with undeniable cost in "seeds to wither in foreign soils." Accumulative lens holds as density shifts from conjecture to acceptance, reweighting stakes via transliterated script.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crater glass constrains choices (script gaps demand catalysts) and charges final image ("Embrace the scatter"). Geode walls actively pulse approval, making environment inseparable from thematic charge at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via protagonist's agency: conjecture evolves from passive wondering to active seed-planting. Cost crystallizes in "choices abandoned mid-flight" withering vines, narrowing options to embrace transience under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing via final transliterated script reweighting prior material. Theme emerges from concrete particulars (crater glass gaps, seed failures), though "seeds of potential" risks near-abstraction in mid-beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct ("sea foam recollections," "soul's map"); rhythmic control shifts from languid cave descriptions to urgent seed-planting. Zero head-hopping; compression taught early via memory-fade motif.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>No closure-touching artifacts; "bittersweet fog" slightly clichéd but redeemed by concrete action. Near-loop in "fragile and quick to dissolve" / "slipping away" deducts minimally. Final image clarity intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-as-geology with emotional transliteration. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative lens) heightens stakes without obscuring closure; "cheerful gloom" transforms from descriptor to earned philosophy.</comment>
