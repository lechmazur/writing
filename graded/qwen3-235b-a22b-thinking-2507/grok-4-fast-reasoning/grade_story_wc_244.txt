<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority avoids therapy-speak; loneliness manifests in brittle jokes and micro-choices like slipping away at dawn. Crowd characters lack depth beyond Elias, thinning reciprocity’s crucible despite his embodied contradiction (giving aid but yearning for exchange).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: moon rock catalyzes revelations but Elias’s departure proves reciprocity’s cost—connection without permanence. Orientation anchors by para 2; minor flaw is his abrupt vanishing lacking deeper causality for leaving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ivy evolves from "choking" to "polite frame," actively constraining choices (rusty stairs, lantern-lit tower) and charging the final image. Disused station isn’t backdrop but pressure—meets 9+ gate, though capped due to Q2 <8.8.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Loneliness vs. nomadism creates authentic tension; rumor spread escalates pressure through Elias’s agency ("trade for your best bad joke"). Cost is felt in his departure, but crowd’s collective resolution slightly diffuses his personal stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Cure’s in the sharing" emerges organically from the rock exchange, reweighting ivy’s meaning without moralizing. Final image resonates as non-literal answer to solitude, though capped per high-band gate due to Q2 <8.8.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice has distinct texture ("courteous vines," "rumor spread like ivy"), but crowd voices converge under stress—librarian/artist lack differentiation. Elias’s "desperately jocular" cadence modulates well, yet minor register drift in "logistician’s mind mapping" dulls immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong propulsion with vivid specifics ("cracking like brittle ice" embodies facade), but "polite anarchy" repetition borders on template cadence. Mixed metaphor ("cracking like brittle ice") slightly muddles peak beats without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "lonely wanderer" trope via logistics framing and "polite anarchy" lens; moon rock as reciprocity catalyst feels fresh. Avoids sentimentality with Elias’s unresolved ending, though capped due to Q2 <8.8.</comment>
