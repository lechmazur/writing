<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interiority leans abstract; "certify wonder" borders on thematic statement rather than embodied contradiction. No visible trade-offs for synesthesia despite high stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with the statue's emergence, but cost remains conceptual ("capacity to marvel" restored) without tangible loss. Accumulative lens holds through sensory escalation, yet stakes lack visceral threat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice cavern actively constrains action (waiting for chisel-strike moment); micro-setting of frost-rimed stone ledge directly enables bell placement. Final image charged by ice-veined boulder cracking—environment shapes closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("certify wonder") never materializes as concrete pressure; no narrowing of options or trade-offs. Escalation relies on sensory density alone without protagonist-driven choices that risk failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges through prism-songs melting "ethereal restraints," but final paragraph's "proving wonder essential" states the moral outright, triggering Thematic Echo penalty (-0.7) in peak beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless: every detail filtered through synesthetic lens ("emerald waves," "scarlet spirals"). Rhythmic control mirrors bell chimes; no head-hopping despite single POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "synesthetically blessed" repetitions; "oscillating repose" refrain risks cadence loops but pays off in closure. No closure-touched artifacts—prose propulsion aligns with bell-striking urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "artist reviving lost work" trope via synesthetic mechanics; specificity of prism-songs melting "ethereal restraints" avoids abstraction. Risk-taking heightens coherence but safety-middle hedging in conflict execution.</comment>
