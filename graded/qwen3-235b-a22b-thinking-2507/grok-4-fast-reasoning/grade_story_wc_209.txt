<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority remains poetic but abstract; "quiet drive" lacks contradictory impulses or visible struggle under pressure. Epiphany feels earned through reflection but misses embodied micro-choices during pivotal realization ("she pieced it together" lacks tension). Strengths: motivation rooted in grandmother's postcards, grief woven into artistic identity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: "flowers bloomed at night to claim their own light" reweights premise with conceptual cost (accepting hiddenness as strength). But escalation lacks meaningful deepening—realization emerges passively without testing stakes. Orientation strong (amber pavilion established by para 1), yet accumulation never tightens options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amber pavilion and etched glass function as micro-setting that charges final image ("umbral tenderness" motif culminates in "blooming certainty"). Sensory details (sodden leaves, honeyed glass) reflect urgency but environment doesn't constrain choices—snow melts passively rather than hindering action. Misses 9+ gate as setting mirrors rather than alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding night-blooming flowers) signaled early but pressure never escalates: no complication or deepening of conflict. Stakes remain abstract (emotional understanding) without visceral testing—snow melting is backdrop, not active constraint. Agency is observational, not active choice-making; cost (tears, peace) felt but not earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of hidden resilience emerges organically through night flowers and grandmother's life without moralizing. Final image ("hidden blooms would always find their moment") resonates as non-literal answer to central question. But lacks complexity—no counterpoints to "quiet defiance" insight, and wisdom arises from passive observation rather than earned struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines: artist’s light/shadow fixation shapes diction ("amber hues," "umbral warmth"). Rhythmic control elevates tension in cathedral scene with purposeful fragments ("Pressing close"). No head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early ("umbral tenderness" motif) and paid off in closure. Minor register drift in "reckoned it was more than botany" avoids diagnostic pitfalls.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sodden leaves," "thinning white crust" exemplify textural specificity. Every sentence multi-tasks (e.g., "pooling into rivulets that carved paths" advances setting/mood/theme). Near-flawless rhythm variation—longer sentences in reflection, clipped phrases during discovery ("One panel depicted night flowers"). Final line’s "blooming certainty" slightly clichéd but redeemed by earned resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of art, grief, and botany through specific nocturnal lens avoids stock tropes. Emotional truth in "loving fiercely in hidden ways" feels lived-in, but premise (artistic epiphany via family artifact) lacks bold risk. Transformation through "umbral tenderness" motif elevates familiarity, yet doesn’t fully escape safety middle—resolution avoids messy contradictions.</comment>
