<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in embodied action (chalk smudging, trembling hands); contradictory impulses (seeking permanence while forgetting) drive credible closure with visible cost as fog lifts slightly after recording.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly under Accumulative lens; cost legible in "longing ebbed slightly" after capturing the hum. Minor friction: precognitive flashes verge on convenient but serve density escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fog garden actively constrains choices (chalk dissolves, driftwood navigation) and charges closure; cassette tapes' "magnetic ghosts" evolve from atmosphere to captured hum, meeting 9+ gate for recurring object shaping final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias' agency (rearranging driftwood to channel sound), narrowing options with felt cost in trembling hands and fading visions. Price charges final image via temporary relief in thickening fog.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (chalk, driftwood decay), not abstraction; final hum reweights "tidal longing" as non-literal answer without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers in whether solace is sustainable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("magnetic ghosts murmuring") and rhythmic control mirror Elias' fragmented cognition; voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; high density ("bones settling into wisdom") with propulsion. Minor deduction: "static longing" slightly mixed metaphor but doesn't obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "aging" trope through tactile sound motif; risk-taking with Accumulative structure pays off via driftwood mechanics. Avoids generic sentimentality through junkyard specificity.</comment>
