<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in concrete action (kneeling in tide pools), but "unused courage" abstraction slightly undermines embodied motivation; micro-choices like tracing the ticket card earn the transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens (dissolving leash ghost, glowing card), but cost lacks visceral punch—dissolution feels conceptual rather than felt in the pivotal embrace beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ridgeway’s damp earth "cradling hesitant strides" and tide pools mirroring the moon constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory specificity mirrors internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through pressure of indirect routes (cliffs vs. curves), but the guides’ sudden appearance lacks causal friction—coincidence complicates without testing Elara’s agency sufficiently mid-journey.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tide pool vision (unleashed self) without moralizing; avoids thematic echo despite "courage waits" line by embedding insight in concrete action at the cove.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mist clung like forgotten dreams") and rhythmic control under pressure; "gently persistent" refrain deepens texture without monotony, taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "boots sinking into damp earth that cradled each hesitant stride," though "veils of fog" edges toward cliché without sufficient novelty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synthesizes spiritual-guide trope through specific ridgeway mechanics and star-stamped tickets; risk in Accumulative lens pays off with the tide pool vision’s emotional specificity.</comment>
