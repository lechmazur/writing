<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority grounded in storm-recording habits ("boots whispering against mossy tiles"), but "credibly curious" phrasing edges toward diagnostic label-speak. Contradictory impulses lack simultaneous action in pivotal moments; follower threat remains abstract without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with conceptual cost ("solitude as the forge of unyielding honesty"), but the follower's threat lacks visceral legibility. Orientation flawless; lens (Accumulative/Textural) inferred early and held through atmospheric escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Courtyard setting pressures choices (observing pigeon while tracking follower), with "mossy tiles" and dovecote constraining movement. Micro-setting (message tube) charges final image, but environmental constraints on tactics could be sharper for 9+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes (integrity vs. zone's corruption) signaled early, with pigeon message tightening options. Agency strong in lateral communication plan, but follower threat remains under-embodied; cost needs more tangible pressure at closure to enter 8.8+ band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through storm records and encoded messages; final image reweights "nurture integrity" without moralizing. Avoids Thematic Echo penalty, but conceptual cost requires slightly deeper integration with physical stakes for 9.0+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("barometric pressures," "amber and shadow"), with rhythm modulating tension. Slight register drift in "intuiting their retreat" during high stress prevents 9.0; otherwise exemplary voice control under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Near-flawless density ("damp stone and fading jasmine"), but "credibly curious nature" triggers diagnostic label penalty. No loops in closure beat, though "pulse steadied" edges toward bodily cliché; momentum preserved through concrete verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of storm recorder as resistance figure avoids rogue-zone tropes. Specificity ("message tube glinted faintly") elevates, but "layered tranquility" phrasing slightly overused in literary fiction; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
