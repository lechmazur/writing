<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via dance-as-weaponizing-grief; micro-choices like dice rolls reveal vulnerability-to-strength hierarchy. Minor flaw: Liora's restoration lacks embodied cost beyond conceptual "tearless wonder," slightly flattening the closure's emotional charge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise—sisters ascending with "more webs awaited" reweights freedom's cost. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via sensory density tightening pressure. Cost proof solid in "vulnerability encrypted as strength" but conceptual price slightly oblique at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken lab functions as micro-setting constraint: water pressure shapes heartbeat rhythm, silt-covered panels demand tactile navigation. Final image charged by transformed sea ("oppressive" to "gentle currents"), meeting 9+ gate through environmental reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes viscerally felt through grief-as-"raw ache," escalating via dance decryption deepening knowledge. Agency crystallizes in calm defiance (twirls encrypting torment), with unmistakable conceptual cost in "more webs awaited." Pressure tightens through density, not false reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: dance transforms grief into weapon, dice invert fate. Final line ("spider's web dissolved into freedom's vast expanse... more webs awaited") offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting vulnerability as ongoing struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in kelp-like sways and binary poetry; syntax compresses under pressure ("Alarms bubbled faintly, but her defiance remained calm"). Zero head-hopping, with psychic distance modulating seamlessly from journal intimacy to dance expansiveness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold—sentences multitask ("fingers fluttering as if spinning silk from vulnerability's thread" advances plot, theme, and setting). Figurative language precise even in climax; final line’s rhythm variation ("carried them in gentle currents") delivers closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: code-breaking as dance, vulnerability as armor. Avoids sci-fi tropes—liberation via sea-shanty ciphers feels earned. Transformation test passed: swap "sunken lab" for spaceship and emotional core collapses, proving specificity’s necessity.</comment>
