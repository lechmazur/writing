<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but "aberrant mercy" remains thematic label; forgiveness of arsonists lacks embodied cost despite strong micro-choice tracing tessera chips. Diagnostic phrasing "retrocognitively trapped" triggers -0.5 penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (retro-cognition shifting from chains to tool), but felt stakes lack visceral specificity. "Steps lighter" implies cost without dramatizing emotional/physical toll of renunciation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Shattered sky and tessera create potent atmosphere, but setting doesn't constrain choices beyond symbolic resonance. Micro-setting (mosaic stone) charges final image yet fails to actively pressure decisions during ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes clear (empathy vs. ruin), but escalation lacks meaningful deepening—retro-cognition shift happens abruptly without narrowing options. Forgiveness moment feels unearned as no trade-off or tactical cost materializes on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "warm coldness" motif, but final paragraph's "quiet rebellion" states moral instead of showing earned resonance. Avoids sentimentality yet loses points for near-thematic echo in "thrived in quiet rebellion."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("auroras of ash," "warm coldness") with rhythmic control; retro-cognition visions taught early and paid off. Slight register drift in "aberrant mercy" but elision remains legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops but "warm coldness" repetition (4x) creates synonym churn. "Aberrant mercy bloomed" in climax triggers -0.6 for thematic echo; otherwise exceptional density and propulsion through concrete verbs ("cradled," "stirred," "wove").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retro-cognition and renaming ritual feels inevitable; "arms of steel" metaphor transforms cliché through specific stakes. Derivative risk in "shattered sky" motif partially redeemed by tactile tessera mechanics and emotional authenticity.</comment>
