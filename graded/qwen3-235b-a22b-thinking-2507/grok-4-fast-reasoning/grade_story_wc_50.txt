<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (locksmith precision vs. irrational wonder) is embodied in micro-choices like filing gears to match marble, but "echoes of loss" phrasing veers into diagnostic label-speak during breakthrough, undermining visceral grief. Motivation crystallizes cleanly yet emotional progression lacks specific embodiment beyond metaphors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (bottled wonder as emotional vulnerability), but the exact cost image—"locking away his own echoes of loss"—remains abstract without concrete sensory anchor, failing cost proof test. Accumulative lens holds through density increase in reflection studies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marble walls function as micro-setting that constrains choice (angles dictate echo capture), charging the final image where "diagrams of angles" become vessels for wonder. Sensory hierarchy excels: quartz veins pulse, drips refract sharply, yet "wounded season" remains vague weather cliché undercutting specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes (healing wounds through bottled wonder) tighten via protagonist agency—studying angles alters tactics—but pressure lacks escalation; rusted gears pose initial obstacle yet no meaningful setback occurs before breakthrough. Cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: timer mirrors refracting drips become metaphor for storing grief, with final line ("harvest was his own reflection") offering resonant non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing but "cellar of reason" phrasing edges toward thematic echo without sufficient subtextual weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "peripherally focused" noticing (fractured edges gleam first), with rhythmic control under pressure via short clauses during breakthrough ("timer whirred faintly"). No head-hopping, though reflection fragments slightly blur present/future tense in "when wounds began to mend."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops with high density ("tools scattered like stars on the veined floor"), but "season hung wounded" creates mixed metaphor (hanging vs. bleeding) that muddles physical logic. Final image's "bruised purples" avoids purple prose through precise textural specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms "echo harvester" trope through locksmith's tactile precision—gears filed to match marble's reflective variances—yet "wounded season" relies on familiar decay motifs. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes, but emotional specificity lacks verifiable detail (e.g., war's toll remains abstract).</comment>
