<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but "positively wistful" recurs as label-only trait; tears at closure show embodied cost but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with tears tracing sand paths showing cost; Accumulative lens holds through sound-layering escalation, though survival stakes remain under-tested beyond metaphor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dunes actively constrain sound-capture method and muffle external world, charging the golden-hued final image where setting becomes generative rather than decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single stake (bridging generations) tightens through sound-pouring sequence, but cost remains purely emotional; no tangible loss (e.g., a jar breaking) limits escalation depth despite lyrical pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through jar mechanics and fractured melodies; final image reweights "lonesome splendor" without moralizing, though "gleaned redemption" phrasing risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "vagrant penny poet" lexicon, but "positively wistful" repetition creates register drift; rhythmic control frays when poetic diction overrides character plausibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density falters in final third with "positively wistful" paraphrase loop and "lonesome splendor" echo; minor scaffold reduces propulsion though imagery remains texturally precise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-capture mechanics with generational translation; avoids sentimentality but music-box trope lacks sufficient transformation to breach high-band gates.</comment>
