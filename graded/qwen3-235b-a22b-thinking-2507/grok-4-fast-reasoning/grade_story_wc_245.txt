<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "quiet blaze" vs absorbed trauma; micro-choices like kneeling at the pool earn closure. Slight competence edge (no physical struggle in forest) prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise RR lands perfectly: pool reflection reconfigures pain/peace with conceptual cost. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds from "pause of shifting constellations" through crescendo. Cost proof: "dipped hands... absorbing forgiveness" crystallizes trade-off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest constrains every choice (vibrations as map); crystalline pool charges final image by reflecting "raw essence of feeling." Micro-setting (compass ring) alters tactics via "subtle pulses." No white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (emotional navigation) tightens via musical trail deepening; guilt of survival becomes felt cost when memories surface. Agency-driven escalation flawless, but visible physical cost (e.g., exhaustion) missing to reach 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through mapmaking metaphor: "etching emotional odyssey" answers central question without moralizing. Final image ("pain and peace intertwined") reweights premise with conceptual cost. Zero thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature impeccable: "skin prickled with absorbed phrases" shows tactile POV bias. Rhythmic control under stress ("Hours blurred... stars holding vigil") avoids uniformity. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("dowsing rod carved from resonant wood" does triple duty). "Silent screams within her soul" edges toward label-speak but redeemed by immediate concrete action (kneeling at pool). Closure beat pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Blind mapmaker premise transformed by ultrasonic forest logic; "absorbs languages through skin" feels fresh, not quirky. Emotional specificity avoids templates. Risk-taking (sound-based reality) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
