<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Harlan's grief-driven motivation ("translate distance into closeness") is embodied through the leaf ritual and micro-choices like tracing cylinder grooves, but bloodhound intuition remains tell-not-show ("metaphorically sniffing authenticity"). Contradictory impulses lack active scene manifestation despite strong embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Harlan's realization of Elara's survival ("revelations settling like dust") carries felt cost through the leaf's "heartbeat" warmth and lighter steps. Accumulative lens holds throughout with atmospheric pressure building toward crystallized final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Scrapyard setting actively constrains action ("labyrinth of twisted metal" shaping Harlan's search), while the wax leaf evolves from memory object to talisman charging the finale. "Rust's bite" and "bent fencer curved like lover's sigh" show purposeful sensory filtering through bloodhound POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes (reconnecting with Elara) deepen through "tinted revelations" but lack concrete on-page cost escalation; cylinder pursuit never risks survival or forces trade-offs. Pressure accumulates texturally yet misses visible price that narrows options despite strong thematic convergence at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "tinted revelations" and echo metaphor, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("steps lighter... echo bridging what war had torn") reweights separation as reluctant heroism, though "wild heart" phrasing risks slight abstraction near closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines: bloodhound POV filters debris as "ghosts of decay," fenders as "lover's sigh." Rhythmic control under pressure ("sun bled orange across cracks") avoids elision issues. Minor register drift in "conceptual cost" phrasing prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "shack lit by salvaged lantern's flicker" compresses setting into action. Docked 0.3 for borderline mixed metaphor ("tinted revelations began to unfold; the cylinder's authors... had encoded warnings"). Zero loops or scaffold in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bloodhound skills applied to textual archaeology avoids trope recycling. "Tinted revelations" reframes war narratives through survivor bias, with specificity like "maps led to ambushes" anchoring universals. Lacks one transformative risk to reach 9.0.</comment>
