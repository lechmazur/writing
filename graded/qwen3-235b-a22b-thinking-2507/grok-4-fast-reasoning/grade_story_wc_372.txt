<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in "gently meticulous" focus sharpening against void, but cost of endurance remains abstract; micro-choice of slide adjustment lacks visible tradeoffs beyond generic "unyielding care." Motivation ("conjure meaning from oblivion's edge") isn't dramatized through specific conflicting impulses in peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with library's "frost sighing in relief," but cost remains conceptual rather than legible on-page; no exact sentence/image where oblivion's price is felt beyond atmospheric relief. Orientation strong ("frozen library above clouds" anchors by word 10), but cost proof test fails per Q2 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Quartz hush" evolves from sensory detail to micro-setting that charges closure ("frosted sigh"), while the magic lantern slide's physicality constrains every action—fingertips tracing runes, crystal probe insertion, gauge ticks—making environment inseparable from Elara's choices under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes (vows' decay) tighten through 432Hz crisis, but escalation lacks tangible narrowing of options; Elara's solution (infusing "stabilizing echoes") resolves the threat too cleanly without visible sacrifice. Agency feels unchallenged—no tradeoff when recalibrating the lantern despite "fracturing like ice under strain."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment><comment>Theme emerges through "luminous vows" reweighted at closure: their reignition isn't victory but fragile stewardship ("oblivion's edge yielded to enduring light"). Avoids moralizing by embedding wisdom in the lantern's mechanics—sampling frequencies as metaphor for salvaging meaning—but final image lacks the conceptual cost needed for 9.0+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines via crystalline lexicon ("quartz hush," "fleeting diamonds") reflecting Elara's archival mind; rhythm modulates from measured ("deliberate grace") to urgent ("pulsed erratically") under pressure. Single-POV stability avoids head-hopping, though reflection on her "own luminous vow" slightly over-explains interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Quartz hush" repeats four times in final paragraph without deepening, creating paraphrase loops that dull closure's charge. Otherwise exemplary propulsion: "inserted the probe... capturing pulses... registered on her ornate gauge" compresses action into kinetic syntax. Final line’s "frosted sigh" avoids sentimentality through concrete texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms archival tropes via crystalline physics (vows as measurable frequencies) and "edge of oblivion" as literal decay. Fresh inflection in treating preservation as spectral engineering—sampling light harmonics—but risks undercut by safe middle; the library’s stakes never feel viscerally threatened beyond aesthetic loss.</comment>
