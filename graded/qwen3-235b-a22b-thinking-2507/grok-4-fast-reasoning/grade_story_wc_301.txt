<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines as Elias dissects guilt through map references while embodied by ivy-brushed shoulder and callused fingers tracing lines; micro-choices like sitting on cold floor to "daringly methodical[ly] dissect" prove change through concrete action, though brother's absence limits relationship crucible depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "weight lift, not erased but redirected" crystallizes stance with undeniable cost via river-channel metaphor; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density of meaning in graffiti/accordion beats without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ivy-choked station functions as micro-setting—vines block paths yet supply "green blood" veins guiding movement; accordion's flaking tape constrains final choice and charges closure image, fulfilling 9+ gate via environmental pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) tightens through three pressure points: timetable references trigger memory surge, graffiti crystallizes insight, accordion enables action; cost legible in "weight lift, not erased," though discovered items slightly dilute pure agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through river-channel metaphor reweighting at closure ("redirected like a river finding new channels"), avoiding moralizing; final image offers non-literal answer to "how to heal" via accordion's "mournful wheeze" as earned wisdom from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "tattered notebooks," "riverine symbols," and "raw solace" reflect chronicler's lexicon; rhythmic control peaks in "daringly methodical" repetitions that modulate with emotional intensity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ivy tendrils curled like accusing fingers" shows embodied metaphor, but "raw solace" repetition in paragraphs 1 and 4 risks synonym churn, slightly dulling final image despite contextual depth.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of river chronicler + railway decay creates emotional specificity; risk-taking with Accumulative/Textural structure heightens stakes, though "daringly methodical" trait lacks sufficient transformation beyond label.</comment>
