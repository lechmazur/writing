<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in bitterness-to-amusement shift; brother's absence motivates micro-choices like pocketing the arrowhead. Thorne lacks depth as secondary pressure, slightly flattening relationship dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara's metamorphosis crystallizes stakes with visible cost (bitterness dissolving into cosmic acceptance). Orientation anchors by word 40, lens holds as accumulative/textural with density increase toward "laughter like cracking ice."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Underground garden constrains every choice—roots as obstacles, fungi light guiding discovery—and charges the final image with levitating herbs. Body (frostbitten hope) and tool (arrowhead) reconfigure closure, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's agency: static confessions force her metamorphosis, narrowing options from investigation to transformation. Cost is legible in "bitterness dissolving," though escalation lacks one tangible trade-off beyond emotional shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "cosmic joke" reframing—final image of arrowhead-as-star reweights loss without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; brother's fate becomes invitation via concrete metamorphosis, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "frost-kissed herbs" and "gravitationally playful" physics; rhythm modulates under pressure. Slight register drift in "reshaping resentment into wry amusement" edges toward abstraction mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero closure artifacts; "laughter like cracking ice" charges final image. One paraphrase loop: "bitterness dissolving... reshaping resentment" risks synonym churn but saved by concrete action ("veins glowing with untamed light").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cryptids as transformative forces, not horror. Emotional specificity in "puckish nudge" avoids tropes; risk-taking with physics (levitating herbs) heightens stakes without gimmickry, meeting 9+ quick test.</comment>
