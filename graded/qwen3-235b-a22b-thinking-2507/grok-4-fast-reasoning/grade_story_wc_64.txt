<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but lacks contradictory impulses; "blithe" trait dominates without visible struggle against gloom. Final realization feels earned yet underweighted by concrete cost—Elias’s cheer remains unchallenged, muting stakes. Micro-choices (tweezers, humming) reveal character but don’t test limits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: "shape of intentions was not rigid, but fluid" reweights premise with conceptual cost. However, cost remains abstract—no felt consequence in Elias’s actions or garden. Lens inferred early via sensory density, but payoff lacks visceral anchoring.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Velveteen gloom" and silo create immersive atmosphere, yet setting never constrains choices—silo is passive backdrop, not tactical resource. Tapestry fragment charges closure, but micro-setting (dew-kissed grass, crates) lacks causal pressure. Sensory richness elevates, but environment doesn’t alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stake (decoding intentions) tightens via Elias’s methodical decoding, narrowing options as threads reveal symbols. Agency is passive—uncovering, not choosing—but pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual (abandoning rigid interpretation) yet feels unearned; no visible price paid in his actions or garden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through tapestry’s unraveling: intentions as fluid, not fixed. Final image ("garden of echoes") resonates without moralizing, but insight borders on abstraction—"tenderly organized by time’s hand" lacks concrete embodiment of cost. Earned through particulars yet slightly detached from visceral stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("velveteen gloom," "uncharted echoes") modulates rhythm to match Elias’s methodical focus. Prose texture mirrors his blithe patience—"tweezers fashioned from old wire" shows character through detail. Near-flawless control, though "tenderly organized" borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffolding, but "tenderly organized" repeats without deepening, nudging toward synonym churn. "Elias smiled blithe as dawn’s first light crept in" leans summary-like, dulling closure’s charge. Otherwise, rhythm varies purposefully; no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess, tapestry, and cemetery tropes avoids cliché through specific stakes ("shape of intentions"). Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off—lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure. "Fluid intentions" reweights premise inevitably, with emotional specificity in Elias’s quiet resolve.</comment>
