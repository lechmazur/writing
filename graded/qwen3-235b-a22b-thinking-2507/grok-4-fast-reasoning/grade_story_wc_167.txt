<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through Elias' "patient endurance" versus "disruptions yet to come" embodied in ripples; micro-choice of pocketing pebble shows earned endurance with visible cost. Overly poetic "noctilucent reckonings" risks abstraction but redeemed by concrete action of adjusting the atrium panel.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: ripple patterns intensify pressure through density increase, culminating in Earned Stasis where "fragile yet enduring" realization forecloses spiritual uncertainty with conceptual cost of impending storm. Closure lands via Elias' adjustment of the loose panel amid spectral light.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: prism atrium's refracted light actively constrains Elias' epiphany ("splintering light into spectral arcs that bent toward the pond"), while damp earth grounds his kneeling. Final image of "harbor's soul whispered through every ripple" charges closure through prior particulars.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through ripple interpretation: "hidden currents of regret" in his craft versus "harmony" in mundane magic. Agency-driven escalation via stone-throwing ritual narrows options to enduring fragility, with felt cost in "before everything shifted" foreshadowing. Dominant stake tightens cleanly once.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reframing: "simple pane could capture dawn's fire" becomes resonant answer to central question. Final image of "fragile glowed with purpose" delivers Conceptual Repricing without moralizing, reweighting glasswork's worth through prior ripples and prisms.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless: glazier's occupational lexicon ("panes," "refracting") filters dawn observations. Rhythmic control under pressure shown in fragmented syntax ("Concentric rings bloomed outward...") contrasting lyrical density during epiphany. Zero register drift despite poetic diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line propulsion excels: "He adjusted a loose panel, his touch reverent" shows rather than tells transformation. Minor artifact in "noctilucent reckonings" repetition risks overwriting but redeemed by closure integration. No loops; final line's "weight of illuminated truths" charges motif without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of occupational specificity (harbor glazier) with universal theme avoids tropes. "Fragile glowed with purpose" transforms mundane labor into spiritual practice through prism physics, resisting abstraction. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
