<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction lacks active tension; "patiently strategic" trait informs decoding but isn't tested under stress. Final planting choice earns closure with visible cost, yet emotional complexity remains underdeveloped beyond stated motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds impeccably: arrow distraction enables escape, scattering keys forces enforcer hesitation. Closure achieves Charged Poise as planting seeds reconfigures division's legacy with conceptual cost ("resilience would bloom from ashes") made undeniable by soil and moonlight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival functions as micro-setting that constrains choices: ribbon-fletched arrow enables recognition, toppled counter provides cover. Final image of seeds in "dry soil pierced by moonlight" charges closure through environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (preserving resilience against opportunists) tightens meaningfully when enforcers' attempt to impede backfires via Elias's arrow distraction. Cost is visible in chain-breaking on rubble, though "impede" action slightly externalizes pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: seeds as resilience symbols avoid moralizing. Final planting action reweights division's legacy without stating a moral, offering resonant non-literal answer through "kernels of wheat and wildflowers" blooming from ashes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("scent of rust and faded cotton candy") shines, but "staggering grace" repetition creates mechanical rhythm under stress. Psychic distance modulates effectively during decoding yet converges in escape sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Staggering grace" repeats three times with identical phrasing, triggering template-cadence penalty in high-pressure beats. Otherwise crystalline prose; "brass keys scattered across velvet" exemplifies textural specificity, but scaffold loops dull climax momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms Cold War tropes through agricultural resilience angle. Specific details (carnival ribbons on arrows, heirloom seeds for poisoned soil) synthesize into fresh vision. Bold risk in climax being planting—not fighting—heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
