<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation (decoding to aid lost travelers) drives tangible choices; embodied emotion via callused fingers tracing misaligned joints avoids therapy-speak. Apprentices lack depth but single-POV focus holds interiority strong under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Decisive Change lands cleanly: drone's flight carries conceptual cost of "mended hope," with Accumulative lens holding through vibration-refraction synthesis. Minor softness in temporal pressure from anchor lift limits escalation intensity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Harbor brine in water basins actively bends light to reveal fractures—environment constrains repair method and charges final image ("jewel in calm dawn"). Micro-setting (oak workbench's "ghosts of fixes") shapes tactile choices without ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes (decode drone before ship departs) tighten via anchor's chain-song and clarifying vibrations under Accumulative pressure. Cost ("heartfelt ache") feels slightly abstract versus physical toll; escalation lacks one visceral tradeoff to hit 8.8+ band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Final drone flight reweights "broken wonders" motif into earned hope without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite "mended hope" phrasing—resonance stems from iridescent wings' tactile repair, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: heat patterns as "liquid mirrors" replace sight uniquely. Rhythm modulates from "low groan of locomotives" to "triumphant" horn. One register drift ("magnetic calm") barely dents otherwise flawless sensory bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or artifacts; "prismatic veils" and "stitching into wing's core" fuse image/action. Final line recharges opening's "broken wonders" with crystalline propulsion. Overwriting risk in "whisper of his soul" averted by concrete context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Blindness refracting light via harbor brine transforms repair trope with emotional specificity. Risk-taking (sensory substitution method) heightens stakes coherently—no gimmickry. Freshness anchored in brine-altered refraction physics.</comment>
