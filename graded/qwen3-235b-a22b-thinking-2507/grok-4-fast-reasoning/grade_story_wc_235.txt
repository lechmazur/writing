<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "envied that younger self, so fiercely it burned" and "jealousy of past selves... propelled him to capture chaos." Micro-choice to write on birch bark reveals hierarchy of values (art over comfort) with embodied cost ("floorboards creaking like old bones"). No secondary characters to penalize relationship bullets.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "weight of past selves no longer a chain but a wind beneath his imagined wings" crystallizes options with felt cost (hollowness transformed but not erased). Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density increase ("roots twisted upward... soar above pines") with pattern break at "jealousy eased into understanding." Cost legible in "hollowed by years" now "tamed into lines of ink."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Birch bark scroll functions as micro-setting that charges final image ("rolled carefully, its weight a talisman"). Frost-laced panes and resin scent filter through Elias' urgency ("chronologically confused" state narrows perception to tactile details). Tool constrains choice—ink on bark absorbs "wildness" paper cannot, directly enabling closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency: "getting jealous... fueled his pen" narrows options to writing as rebellion. Dominant stake (confronting mortality through nostalgia) tightens via "feral nostalgia surged... each version more alive than the man he was now." Cost visible in "hollowed by years" becoming "tamed into lines," reweighting final image under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "birch bark" motif: "absorbing wildness without judgment" → "tamed into lines of ink" reweights nostalgia as creative fuel. Avoids moralizing via concrete action (writing the scroll), but "jealousy into flight" edges toward thematic echo, slightly muddying resonance. Final image ("wind beneath wings") answers central question without stating moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: "taste of damp earth," "cabin's wooden walls groaning" reflect Elias' sensory prioritization under stress. Rhythmic control peaks in "roots twisted upward, pulling him not down but into the air" with intentional compression. Zero head-hopping; single-POV consistency anchors all lyricism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: "jaded wonder blooming as he glimpsed the cabin below" layers emotion and action. Minor scaffold in "a raw, untamed yearning for the boy he'd been" (redundant after "feral nostalgia"), but no closure-dulling artifacts. Figurative language ("wings of memory unfurled") stays consistent with Elias' voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis: "feral nostalgia" as active force (not passive feeling) transforms mortality trope. Specificity in "birch bark harvested from slopes" grounds universal theme. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off—closure reweights "grave" from endpoint to "gateway" through earned lyric reprise.</comment>
