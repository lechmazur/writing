<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied action ("cradled it gently" vs. "haunted ambitions surged"), but "physics of transition" motivation edges toward thematic abstraction rather than concrete struggle. Micro-choices under pressure (speaking to empty air, planting seed) earn the quiet resolution with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as flawless Charged Poise: the sprout's emergence reconfigures "haunted ambitions" into "guides" with palpable cost ("spirit's leaving had severed"). Orientation anchors by 80 words; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through magnetic hum's evolution from "lonely pulse" to approving resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor isn't backdrop but active constraint—levitating platform enables her work, conductive vines spark during analysis. Final sprout in "magnetic soil" charges closure by making the ethereal physical, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment charging the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding transition physics) tightens through her analogical method, culminating in the planting decision that forecloses ghostly longing. Cost is legible in "peace settled over her like a soft veil"—the earned shift from ache to quiet resolve under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete particulars: cuneiform analogies become the non-literal answer to "transition isn't loss but reconfiguration." Final sprout image reweights "haunted ambitions" without moralizing, perfectly fulfilling the 9+ test for resonant closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful: a translator's precision shapes every observation ("unfamiliar grooves that reminded her of archaic scripts"). Rhythmic control under pressure ("roots would draw from magnetic soil, analogizing the spirit's path") avoids lyric excess while deepening stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "woven from conductive vines that sparked faintly" exemplifies high-density propulsion. One near-miss: "wove a tapestry of understanding" slightly overwrites, but the final image ("bridge rebuilt through thought and time") avoids figurative muddle, preserving closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cuneiform scholarship with quantum metaphysics avoids derivative tropes. Risk-taking with Accumulative structure pays off through the magnetic arbor's evolving hum, transforming familiar grief into a tangible "bridge" without gimmickry—exemplifying the 9+ synthesis test.</comment>
