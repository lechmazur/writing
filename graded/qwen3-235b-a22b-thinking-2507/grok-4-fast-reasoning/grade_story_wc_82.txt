<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: grief clawing "like thorns hidden in silk" while folding paper birds embodies simultaneous hope/despair. Micro-choices (selecting amethyst, whispering incantations) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost in trembling hands and lingering shadows. No diagnostic labels; embodiment avoids cliché.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "fragile peace" crystallizes options with felt cost in "shadows of doubt lingering but no longer binding." Orientation anchors by line 3. Accumulative lens holds, but paradoxical island motion doesn't deepen pressure—missed chance to constrain choices during crane release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tea garden functions as micro-setting: mist-kissed fibers become dream-weave paper, directly constraining Elias's crane-folding tactics. Basilica's refracted light charges final image as cranes ignite "tea leaves in soft, golden fire." Specificity avoids generic fantasy tropes through tactile details like chamois cloth with diamond dust.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (alchemizing grief) tightens via Elias's agency—polishing gems, folding cranes—narrowing options from desperate ritual to fragile release. Cost legible in "torment eased fractionally," but paradoxical island motion feels decorative rather than deepening pressure; could have constrained crane-release timing for sharper escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through cranes as vessels: "weaving loss into flight" reweights grief without moralizing. Final image avoids sentimentality by emphasizing "not erasure, but fragile peace." Ambiguity lingers in "shadows of doubt," but Lira's absence resolves too neatly for maximum thematic complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "silver-leaved bushes whispered secrets," "laughter echoing like wind chimes" filter world through Elias's grief. Rhythm modulates under pressure—short clauses during gem polishing ("friction singing softly") contrast lyrical release sequences. No head-hopping; single-POV consistency exemplary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold: "grief clawed at his chest like thorns hidden in silk" followed by "grief folded inward" risks subtle repetition. "Luminous torment" recurs without sufficient evolution. Propulsion strong in polishing sequence, but minor synonym churn ("fractured light"/"golden fire" on tea leaves) slightly dulls closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lanterns as "delicate cages for captured dreams" transforms grief ritual into tangible craft. Emotional specificity ("thorns hidden in silk") avoids generic templates. Risk-taking with Accumulative lens heightens stakes, though shadow detachment leans on familiar trope without full transformation.</comment>
