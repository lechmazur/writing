<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "hopeful melancholy" and dent-as-wisdom reframing, but simultaneous contradictory impulses lack visceral tension in peak correlation moments; micro-choices like pressing the stone anchor motivation credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "exile not an end, but a board reset" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (dent as badge), though the Accumulative lens inference slightly delays until 40% mark.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Basalt worry stone constrains every choice and charges the final image ("dent a badge of endurance"), with magnetic pulses woven into action; sensory hierarchy flawlessly mirrors Elias’s tactical focus under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via density—silence correlations narrow options toward moonrise deadline—with unmistakable cost in the dent’s reweighting; agency-driven deepening elevates stakes beyond abstract covenant repair.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Beauty unveiled itself in the difficult" emerges purely through charged particulars (dent, silence translation), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights exile’s meaning without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable ("gaps between magnetic pulses tugged at his veins"), with rhythmic compression during correlations; no dialogue to test distinction, but voice modulates precisely with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "bruising into purples" and "silences spoke volumes" exemplify textural density without muddle; final line’s cadence ("beauty unveiled itself in the difficult") recharges the motif flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Synthesizes chess strategy and magnetic mysticism into fresh emotional calculus, but exile trope risks familiarity; specificity of "basalt worry stone" and silence-translation method elevate it beyond archetype.</comment>
