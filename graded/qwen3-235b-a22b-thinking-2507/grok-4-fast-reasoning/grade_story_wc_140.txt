<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation for discovering memory texture is concrete and embodied through micro-choices like crouching to eavesdrop and clutching the poison label, though internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses during pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with conceptual cost ("void, now textured with borrowed histories"), but orientation debt in the labyrinth's spatial choreography slightly obscures pressure flow during tide transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shipping containers function as micro-setting that charges the final image ("collector of whispers"), with barnacles and rust textures constraining movement and mirroring memory erosion—environment actively shapes the protagonist's tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation but lack mechanical escalation; tides provide rhythm without tightening decisions, missing the "live clock" pressure needed for high-band escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the poison label's transformation into "bitter tang of forgotten lives," avoiding moralizing while reweighting erasure via the final "jagged, salty layers" image—resonant without stating the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("seeing ghosts of erased histories") sustains voice under pressure, though the transition phrases "As the tide ebbed..." create a template cadence run that briefly dulls immediacy in mid-story beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops in closure beats but minor propulsion drag from filter-verb stacks ("they noted," "they committed") during overheard fragments; "dissolved into the sea's indifferent embrace" exemplifies high-density lyricism without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bureaucratic erasure and memory-as-tapestry feels inevitable, with the port's "ink's mistakes" framing transforming clichés through specific sensory details like "cryptic codes" on containers.</comment>
