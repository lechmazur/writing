<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "nervously confident" vs. "heart stuttered" under pressure; final act of nailing the relic earns redemption with embodied cost ("wept into the fog"). Lacks secondary pressure depth due to minimal character interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the nailed copper relic crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost ("spongey dread softened, absorbing into tentative hope"). Causal lens holds tightly from discovery to reversal affirmation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Weather station's failing generators pressure tactics (decoding during generator hum), but the copper nail's micro-setting constrains choices most powerfully—aligning with journal pages to unlock coordinates. Final image charged by relic nailed to map.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via protagonist agency: decoding journals forces query transmission under storm threat. Cost is visceral—"spongey dread" transforming to "tentative hope" as the station endures, narrowing options to legacy redemption.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through copper nail's evolution from "drowned secret" to "talisman," answering "why do the waves still hide the guide?" via final act. Avoids moralizing; closure reweights exile as enduring courage without stated morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in weather-soaked lexicon ("spongey dread," "jagged permanence") and stress-modulated syntax during decoding. No head-hopping; single-POV consistency elevates rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; high density ("bloated with seawater" conveys decay and urgency). Minor deduction for "nervously confident" repetition (0.1), but propulsion remains unbroken through peak decoding scenes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms disaster tropes via archival obsession—copper nail as decoder reframes historical redemption. Fresh inflection: "reversible exile" becomes active stake rather than passive theme, synthesizing weather science and legacy with emotional specificity.</comment>
