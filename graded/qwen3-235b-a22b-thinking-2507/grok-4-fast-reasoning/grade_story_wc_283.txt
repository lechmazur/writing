<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation burns clear but lacks contradictory impulses; "yearning to offer choices" remains thematic rather than embodied struggle. No visible trade-off when sealing the jar—endurance feels passive, not earned through conflicting desires.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as Elara carries the jar outward, with cost in the "freedoms won from silence" line. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, but orientation drifts slightly—amber warehouse anchors early, yet temporal urgency ("truth unraveling") lacks concrete pressure points.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Amber sap" quill and hourglass sand constrain cataloging choices, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy shines: "dust-moted pedestal" filters through Elara’s tactile focus. Micro-setting (buttons) directly shapes tactics, meeting 9+ gate despite minimal occupational detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes ("world chained to predestined paths") remain abstract; no visible price paid during escalation. Button cataloging deepens knowledge but lacks narrowing options—escalation feels gentle rather than urgent. "Cliffs groaning" hints at environmental pressure, yet consequence stays conceptual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</comment><comment>Theme emerges through "lost buttons" motif, but decoded prophecy’s literal line ("choose not the foretold") risks Thematic Echo. Final image—"freedoms won from silence"—resonates non-literally, yet wisdom dissemination leans toward statement over earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("amber-encased buttons holding imprints of choices") sustains voice under pressure. Rhythmic control falters slightly in climax ("her heart raced in the unearthed silence" verges on abstraction), but compression of time ("seasons" of collecting) teaches pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ochre ones from desert nomads, symbolizing endurance" integrates action/image. Final line’s abstraction ("freedoms won from silence") dulls closure’s texture slightly, but no figurative muddle in peak beats. High density with clean propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Amber-entombed time fragments transform prophecy tropes through tactile specificity. "Lost buttons" mechanism feels fresh yet organic, but "unearthed silence" leans familiar. Risk-taking (cataloging as decoding method) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though safety-hedging in flawless execution limits boldness.</comment>
