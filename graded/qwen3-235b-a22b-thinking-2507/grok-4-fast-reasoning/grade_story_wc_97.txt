<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (wistfulness vs strategic creativity) act simultaneously in repurposing the clock; final choice to play "in bold interruption" earned by embodied micro-choices under pressure. Slight deduction for off-page secondary character limiting relationship crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable conceptual cost in "fate caught off guard" and spinning clock hands marking "new rhythm." Minor escalation gap between reel discovery and projector assembly slightly blurs causal linkage under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tidal arbor actively constrains choices (vines for projector, tides for rhythm) and charges the final image where "tidal branches curling protectively" reconfigures sanctuary into launchpad. Micro-setting qualifies as environment shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias's agency under Accumulative lens: repurposing objects narrows options toward the piano performance. Cost unmistakable in "fate caught off guard" and compasses locking toward "dawn unseen," reweighting the dominant stake of temporal defiance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through flickering compasses as "paths unchosen," with final image ("compasses locked northward") offering resonant non-literal answer to reclaiming time. Avoids moralizing while charging closure through "unscripted encore" as earned wisdom from concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bioluminescent fungi pulsed like hesitant stars") and rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift in "strategically creative" momentarily disrupts voice consistency during high-stakes decision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-loop in "turning discord into hidden harmonies that surprised even the indifferent heavens" followed by similar melody phrasing; template cadence in opening "He sought... but from..." sentences. Zero artifacts in closure beat preserves high-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time/fate motifs through tactile objects (clock with embedded compass); tidal arbor transforms generic refuge into active narrative engine. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscurity, passing transformation test decisively.</comment>
