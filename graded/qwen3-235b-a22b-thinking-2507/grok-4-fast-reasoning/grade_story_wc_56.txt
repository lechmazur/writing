<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias's self-deception about his errant pursuits, but motivation lacks friction—his "architecture of lies" goal stays abstract without testing his flaw during the chest discovery, weakening causal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the sundial's absent shadow in darkness crystallizes conceptual cost of truth's elusiveness. Orientation is flawless, but the hindsight epiphany edges toward telling rather than full dramatization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Twilight canal functions as micro-setting that charges closure—the water's chill and silty bottom directly enable the chest's discovery and reappear in the final tide metaphor, constraining choice and deepening theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when Elias dives, risking physical cost (burning lungs) for truth. But the internal conflict—self-deception versus revelation—lacks visible tradeoffs beyond the epiphany, muting escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from map hoaxes to self-deception, but the final line ("bridge he'd finally crossed") veers toward thematic echo, risking moralizing despite strong lyrical resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: Elias's "trained instincts" filter canal details through salvage expertise. Rhythmic control under pressure (e.g., "bubbles rising around him") avoids ventriloquism, with no head-hopping in single-POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "serene upheaval" repetition earns credit as patterned diction. Final image ("sundial's shadow now absent") achieves crystalline clarity, though "hindsight clarity" phrasing slightly over-tells in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "legend seeker" trope through specific waterway salvage mechanics and the sundial's reprise. Fresh inflection lies in lies-as-architecture metaphor becoming self-revelation, avoiding abstraction via tactile details.</comment>
