<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (enthusiasm vs. stellar doubt) drive key choices, but "wavelength align" borders on diagnostic label-speak; coin-sweeping action shows micro-choice with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost (abandoned coins, lingering doubt); drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) inferred early and held through distillation climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ambered observatory functions as micro-setting: coins constrain choice, receiver enables distillation, and final image recharges amber light with rebirth/doubt tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara’s agency (distillation process), but "universe’s death" remains abstract; cost (sacrificing coins) visibly alters tactics yet lacks visceral physicality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: coins as fragmented pasts charge the final sweep; no moralizing, only resonant image of doubt amid rebirth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("static bursts," "honeyed panes") with rhythmic control under pressure; lyrical compression taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; high density ("coins clinking like distant echoes") with clear propulsion; metaphors serve pressure without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cosmic collapse framed through intimate ritual; foreign coins transform trope via specific empires; risk-taking (backwards prophecy) heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
