<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority rich but lacks contradictory impulses; motivation clear yet static with no earned change or visible cost during discovery. Sensitively perceptive trait shown via actions but no struggle or tradeoffs under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "to dream anew in its wake" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost in "void after humanity's last dream." Accumulative lens holds throughout with diary/tapestry discoveries tightening the resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silo library functions as micro-setting: bioluminescent fungi enable reading, fireplace yields diaries, bronze-hued quiet charges final sigh. Tapestry fragment constrains Elowen’s choices and reweights closure. Body/tool specificity elevates beyond atmospheric catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover axis displacement) signaled early but lacks escalation; discoveries deepen knowledge without narrowing options or raising cost. Pressure accumulates texturally yet misses protagonist-driven tightening—no meaningful trade-offs or tactical shifts during the beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through tapestry’s sorrowful dragons and "dream anew" realization. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing: stories persist not to restore but to imagine beyond oblivion, charged by the silo’s sigh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bronze quiet," "brittle as autumn leaves") modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control weaves sensory details into character-specific noticing; lyric compression taught early pays off in closure’s resonant simplicity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("air hung heavy... broken only by soft creak") prevents 9.0, but density remains high. No figurative muddle; every line advances atmosphere or character. Final line’s "hush of bronze eternity" delivers crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</comment><question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "historian of ruins" trope via silo-library setting and dragons as axis guardians. Emotional truth in collecting echoes after last dream feels fresh, though risk-taking stops short of structural boldness that heightens stakes.</comment>
