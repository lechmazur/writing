<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied trauma (sweat, vibration felt in bones) and contradictory impulses (fear vs. resolve), but capsize memory lacks visceral sensory flashbacks to deepen internal conflict beyond label-like "unspoken terror."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully: "survival was not endurance alone, but this alchemy" reweights the premise with undeniable emotional cost (tears, shared resilience) under a consistent Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory functions as micro-setting—bioluminescent vines syncing to vibrations charge the final image, while thermal heat-maps actively constrain communication tactics in the silent world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias' agency (striking the fork despite trauma) narrows options to translate silence; cost is visceral (sweat, internal echoes), but the tech's problem-solving feels slightly frictionless for high-band stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through heat-maps transforming trauma into harmony; final "alchemy" image avoids moralizing while reconfiguring silence as fertile ground, though "unshaken marvels" risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (sound translated to vibration/heat) modulates under pressure; minor register drift in "rectified into minor chord progression" slightly clashes with Elias' embodied voice during crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts; lyrical density ("panes gleaming like frozen stars") serves momentum, but "perpetual twilight" borders on cliché without character-specific filtering in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence-as-canvas through heat-mapping tech avoids post-apocalyptic tropes; risk-taking heightens stakes, though emotional resolution leans slightly toward tidy universality.</comment>
