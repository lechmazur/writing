<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (control vs surrender) manifests physically in transformation; micro-choices like pressing the leaf earn the hybrid resolution with felt cost in "fingers elongating into tendrils." Avoids diagnostic label-speak through embodied struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: "no longer just an observer but a participant" crystallizes the Accumulative/Textural lens with visible cost in her hybrid state. Storm pressure tightens through sensory accumulation without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mossy trellis constrains every pivotal choice—from spotting the leaf to final leaning—and charges the dawn image. Sensory hierarchy reflects her botanical focus, with rain intensifying pressure on her surrender.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stake (understanding through surrender) tightens via her physical metamorphosis, but the cost of losing human form could resonate more viscerally in the climax. Agency remains compelling under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "participant not observer" reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image answers the central question through her enduring hybrid state, avoiding thematic echo in the quiet dawn resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in botanical specificity ("veins like sap," "meandering like roots"); rhythm accelerates during transformation. Voice modulates perfectly from observational calm to urgent surrender without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts; lyrical density serves momentum ("moss glistened like emeralds"). Final line’s "metamorphosis would endure" recharges the premise without overwriting. Minor rhythmic opportunity in mid-transformation beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms metamorphosis tropes through "circuitously sincere" specificity and storm-season science. Emotional truth in her scientific motivation meeting spiritual surrender avoids generic eco-romance, though premise edges familiar.</comment>
