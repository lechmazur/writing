<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation ("latent blaze of discovery") but lacks contradictory impulses; micro-choices like tracing doodle reveal values yet interior conflict remains abstract rather than simultaneous struggle under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "pockets heavy with seeds" and "fire within burned brighter" crystallize cost (physical/emotional burden) under causal lens; inversion sequence tightens options with gravity shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Serpentine grotto constrains choices (climbing inverted walls) and charges final image (sealed entrance/heavy pockets), but sensory detail over-indexes on visual, missing tactile mist or stone textures during crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>Stakes tighten via gravity inversion timeframe ("as the inversion neared"), narrowing options to one decisive reentry, though external pressure lacks personal trade-offs beyond physical risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "seeds of vigilance" reweighted from abstract concept to embodied duty in final image; avoids moralizing but secondary "forgotten combinations" motif lacks integration with core vigilance stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("prism-minded" cognition refracting chaos) with rhythmic control, though "clandestinely luminous" repetition risks becoming a hollow tic under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong propulsion but "clandestinely luminous" appears 4x with near-identical phrasing; synonym loops ("latent blaze"/"inner fire") dilute closure impact despite vivid final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of archive tropes with physics-based magic (gravity inversion); "seeds of vigilance" avoids cliché through literal artifacts yet archivist protagonist leans toward archetype without sufficient idiosyncrasy.</comment>
