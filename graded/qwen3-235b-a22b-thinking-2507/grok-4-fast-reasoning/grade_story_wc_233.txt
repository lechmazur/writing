<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction underdeveloped; "disenchantment" stated but not embodied through conflicting impulses. Lirian's late arrival limits relationship-as-crucible development despite strong final incantation moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Orientation debt past 120 words ("throne room" anchors delayed) triggers -0.4 penalty. Accumulative lens holds but closure cost ("forever marked") remains conceptual rather than viscerally legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cobalt grotto described vividly but fails micro-setting test; environment doesn't constrain choices (thorns snag but don't alter tactics). Orientation penalty caps category at 7.0 per rubric.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (break curse vs. succumb) clear, but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—climb obstacles are generic (thorns, breathlessness). Final conceptual cost lacks visceral legibility under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "bleeding starlight" motif, but final line ("queen reborn yet forever marked") edges toward thematic echo. Avoids moralizing penalty by 2 words but lacks non-literal resonance for 9+ band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature strong ("gown whispering like veiled threat"), but orientation penalty caps category at 7.8. Consistent Accumulative lens with no head-hopping, though "shared exhale" phrasing slightly overwrites peak moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Near-flawless rhythm but "breathing starlight" metaphor repeats consecutively in paragraphs 4-5, risking synonym churn. Final image ("ridge's whisper") avoids closure artifacts while maintaining propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Transforms fantasy tropes through specific sensory details (acrid ember scent, fireflies' "tiny warnings"), but premise remains derivative. Lacks the bold risk-taking required for 8.5+ despite coherent emotional truth.</comment>
