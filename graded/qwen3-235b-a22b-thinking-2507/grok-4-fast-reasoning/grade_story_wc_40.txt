<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in crystal handling; weathered innocence shown via tactile micro-choices like shelving the artifact. Final renunciation of despair (smile at "seed") earned by prior causality, though secondary pressure lacks human antagonists.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: dawn light gilding prisms crystallizes linguistic resilience with conceptual cost (obsolescence embraced as growth). Accumulative lens holds; "suspended hush" reweights meaning through Elias’s decoded pattern, avoiding explain-everything resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Library functions as micro-setting: crystal’s sonic reflection constrains testimony method, charging final image where "shadows preserved the hush." Dawn progression (dust motes to birdsong) mirrors linguistic evolution without symbolic shouting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elias’s agency: fractured sequences reveal language’s resilience, narrowing his path from decoding to testifying. Cost (lifelong reticence) feels conceptual but legible when crystal "shattered the sequence" during digitization trauma.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from crystal’s sonic reflection: "growth was not linear conquest" reweights prior material without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite final whisper; ambiguity in "fragile, echoing artifacts" lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes through linguistic obsession: "words as living entities" refracts via scholar’s POV. Rhythmic control under pressure in testimony sequences; no head-hopping despite mosaic shards taught early by "fractured sequences" motif.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "sonically reflective like a frozen echo chamber" integrates metaphor with function. Near-purple prose ("words bloomed and withered like ancient vines") avoids muddle by serving Accumulative lens. Final line’s "illuminating the path" risks sentimentality but earns resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic trope through linguistic specificity: dictionary’s "final testament" made visceral via crystal’s sonic decay. Fresh inflection in "hushed evolution" concept, though "weathered innocence" borders on archetype without secondary character friction.</comment>
