<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's internal contradiction (registrar logging others' truths while hiding his own) manifests concretely through the lens's warmth and hesitant doodle strokes; the final choice to draw his vulnerability feels earned by prior causality with visible cost in "weight of his guarded heart thawing."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: dawn's light on shared understanding crystallizes options with undeniable cost ("weight of his guarded heart thawing"), while the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through refracted light and evolving doodles without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt actively constrains choice—quartz amplifies pencil scrapes enabling eavesdropping, rain puddles mirror Elias's fractured state, and the crystals' "hum" during climax directly charges the final image of evaporating mistrust.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (Elias's mistrust vs transparency) escalates through agency-driven beats: lens discovery fuels eavesdropping, which catalyzes his doodle—a meaningful tightening where the cost ("weight of guarded heart thawing") visibly alters his logging practice at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the doodles' evolving meaning ("locked chest" to "spilling light") offers a non-literal answer to trust's possibility, avoiding moralizing while the lens's refraction embodies perspective's role in understanding without abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fractured stars" in puddles mirroring his state) and rhythmic control shine under pressure—the syntax tightens during climax ("stepping from shadows... extending the lens") while "resonant hush" refrains deepen texture without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence multiplies meaning ("droplets clung like forgotten tears" establishes voice and theme), with "ambiguously clear" accruing weight across beats. Final cadence ("logged the night not in isolation, but in connection") achieves propulsion without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes through specific mechanics: doodles' margin-space limitations and the lens's refractive flaws create authentic constraints, while the registrar's logging duty reconfigured as connection feels inevitable yet fresh, avoiding safety-hedging.</comment>
