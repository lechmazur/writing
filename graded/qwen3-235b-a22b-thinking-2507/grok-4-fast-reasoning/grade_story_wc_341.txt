<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in cloud-emotion categorization, but "quietly explosive tension" veers into diagnostic label-speak. Micro-choices like obsessive telescope wiping reveal grief’s physicality without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: "voids weren’t empty; they were archives" reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost (oxygen deprivation, rewound wholeness). Orientation anchored by word 45; accumulative lens held through atmospheric deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dusty starlight evolves from visual detail to thematic anchor, charging the final image ("dusty starlight promise"). Brass telescope’s silver-edged patina constrains Elias’s memorializing ritual, meeting 9+ gate via object-as-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through atmospheric pressure (oxygen scarcity) but lack visible trade-offs; "quietly explosive" tension remains internalized without altering tactics. One meaningful deepening suffices, yet cost feels conceptual rather than tactical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Spooled wholeness" integrates seamlessly with closure’s "rewinding the spool," avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights emptiness as archival space without stating theme—earned through cloud-labeling particulars like "stratocumulus as regret."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: meteorologist’s selective attention ("cirrus wisps evoked sorrow") shapes description. Minor register drift in "spooled wholeness" lexicon, but rhythmic control sustains tension during oxygen deprivation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero closure artifacts; "dusty starlight" repetitions avoid scaffold through evolving context. Slight overwriting in "patina of countless gazes skyward" but density remains high. Final line’s "sky’s memory lingered" crystallizes momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via scientific lyricism: "empty spaces remember" gains freshness through meteorological precision. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens emotional truth without gimmickry, though sky-gondola setting edges toward romantic familiarity.</comment>
