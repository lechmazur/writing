<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "execute a flawless goodbye" drives tangible choices, but Elena lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; her reconciliation reads as passive acceptance rather than earned internal conflict despite vivid sensory embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with visible cost in "Elena smiled, exhaling into peace," but daughter's unannounced arrival relies on coincidence to resolve the central conflict, violating "coincidence may complicate but not resolve" under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The vinyl shard functions as micro-setting, constraining choices through tactile handling and charging the final image; scent of hope from hidden gardens actively alters emotional tactics when "infused Elara's song," satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen meaningfully around reconciliation, but escalation hinges on daughter's coincidental arrival rather than protagonist agency; the blood work timeframe tightens urgency yet fails to create a "live clock" altering Elara's real-time tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars like "hymning the mundane" transforming "creak of floorboards" into emotional resolution; avoids moralizing with resonant final image of "hope's fragrance lingered" reweighting goodbye's meaning without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "scent of hope" synesthesia, but "pulsing stillness" repetition (4x) creates a patterned loop that dulls immediacy during high-pressure beats like the daughter's arrival.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with lyrical propulsion falters in the final third where "pulsing stillness" scaffold loop ("amplifying the soft strums like a heartbeat") obscures emotional immediacy; otherwise precise verbs like "reunifying" avoid overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms hospice tropes through "scent of hope" mechanic and vinyl shard specificity; "hymning the mundane" offers fresh inflection but risks sentimentality that's narrowly avoided by concrete sensory grounding in Elena's tactile memories.</comment>
