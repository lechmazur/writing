<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong (tracker's patience vs wild resolve), embodied anger through physical details, but motivation lacks friction—pursuit of "why time slows" remains single-minded without sufficient internal conflict deepening under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: "time slowed to forge survivors' resolve" reweights trauma with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds, but the "cosmic mercy" insight feels slightly unearned without prior thematic groundwork in the climax beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Wind-carved setting pressures choices (sand for ink patterns, hollowed paths for movement), and the drone functions as a micro-setting object charging the final image. Canyon lacks tactile specificity, missing the 9+ gate for environmental constraint during the pivotal vanishing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully as Elara uses ink patterns to evade the sorcerer, with conceptual cost in redefining trauma. But escalation lacks trade-offs—the resolution feels convenient, missing a visible price that alters tactics beyond the immediate victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through ink's ephemerality mirroring time distortion, culminating in the non-literal CR ending. Avoids moralizing, but "cosmic mercy" risks thematic echo by stating rather than fully dramatizing the insight through action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("wind-carved spires," "serene anger simmering") and rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift in "alchemical brew traded from shadowed apothecaries" disrupts voice consistency during reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong propulsion and specificity, but scaffold appears in the raid explanation ("During the totality... time itself betrayed them") and slight synonym churn ("shrouded"/"hush"). Final paragraph's abstraction ("cosmic mercy") dulls closure density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time distortion with disappearing ink ritual avoids tropes through Windweavers' cultural specificity. Bold CR closure heightens stakes, but "sorcerer of forgotten arts" leans generic, slightly diluting risk distinction.</comment>
