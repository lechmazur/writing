<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (guarded vs. seeking truth) drives micro-choices under vortex pressure; embodied emotion avoids labels but "heart a battlefield" borders on cliché during crisis beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: "guarded heart... now straightening" shows visible cost of understanding; Accumulative lens holds through expanding circles motif with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard vortex constrains every choice (robe-tugging pull, branch arcs) and charges final image ("cursed orchard now an ally"); sensory hierarchy reflects urgency with ice-floe faces and numbing feet.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency (unbend method) with felt cost in heart's "straightening"; dominant stake ("truth beyond sight") materializes viscerally in sorcerer's guilt vision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "raw, unvarnished guilt" reweights mirrors' deception without moralizing; final image ("serene deception" → "ally in quiet vigil") offers non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("warlike serenity," "froth for any sign") with rhythmic control; elision of backstory taught via "frozen confession" note paid off in visions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("shards glittered like fallen stars amid churning fruit-laden limbs" weaves setting/action); no figurative muddle in climax where seed "thrummed like captured heartbeat".</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via specific logic: flesh-eating seed binds rather than devours as earned consequence; "truth beyond mirrors" premise synthesized through cursed lake's guilt mechanics.</comment>
