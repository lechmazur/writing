<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s colorblindness drives authentic micro-choices (painting flaws, plant arrangements) that escalate to the barter exchange. Thorne’s traded awakening feels earned through guarded solitude, though "quiet flame" phrasing edges toward abstraction without sufficient embodiment in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the concertina’s flawed resonance enables the awakening exchange with undeniable conceptual cost (bartered fragments). Accumulative lens holds through plant arrangements and glass imperfections, reweighting stakes via density without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The courtyard’s glass shards directly constrain choices (Elias paints imperfections, Thorne’s warped bellows) and charge the finale—warped panels scattering sound crystallizes the theme. Micro-setting functions as active constraint, not backdrop, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias’s escalating plant proposals (daisy to laurel), narrowing options toward the concertina collaboration. Conceptual cost of bartered awakenings is unmistakable in the exchange, though the "no loss" for Elias slightly softens the felt weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: flawed glass and plant language reject perfectionism. The finale’s "beauty’s resilient core" resonates as earned wisdom, avoiding moralizing while reweighting the phoenix’s legacy through the concertina’s fractured sound.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias’s perceptual signature shines ("subtle gradients of shadow"), with syntax tightening under pressure ("Thorne, intrigued... left a reply"). Near-duplicate phrasing ("resilient borders"/"resilient core") slightly blurs the distinct voice in reflective moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is largely crystalline ("iridescent glass shards"), but scaffold dilutes momentum: "bartered awakenings had become the hidden currency" feels expositional. Minor synonym churn ("resilient borders"/"resilient core") prevents 9.0 despite strong closure imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via specific logic: colorblindness reframing imperfection as strength, bartered awakenings as conceptual currency. The reed tongue’s integration feels inevitable, with risk-taking (plant language) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
