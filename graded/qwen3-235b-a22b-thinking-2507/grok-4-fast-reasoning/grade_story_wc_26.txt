<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority leans on abstract labels ("luminous regret") rather than embodied contradiction; river stone provides concrete anchor but "Great Fade" backstory lacks present-moment micro-choice to tilt stance. Diagnostic phrasing triggers penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly—preserving the shadow forecloses permanence with visible cost ("momentary victory") under Accumulative/Textural lens. Backstory fragment violates BRR by exceeding 20% without altering present tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Blooming library actively pressures choices (floating walkways, cloud currents); river stone functions as micro-setting that charges the final image ("pocketed once more"). Environment constrains action and reweights closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving hope's shape) tightens via video comparison, but cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt; "momentary victory" implies ongoing struggle without concrete forfeiture in the beat. Agency clear but stakes lack visceral weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Final image of stabilized shadow offers resonant, non-literal answer to commodification of hope; avoids moralizing while charging "luminous regret" with earned complexity. No thematic echo in closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines through "dusk noticer" lens and floral holoprojector details; rhythmic control modulates under pressure ("clouds billowing like pages"). Zero head-hopping in single-POV execution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("softly deliberate" x3, "luminous regret" x2) and filter-verb stacks ("clutched... noticed... had always found") dull immediacy in peak beats. Prose density suffers despite vivid imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-sharing trope via stratospheric library and floral tech; river stone's earthiness creates irreplaceable contrast with airy realm. Transformation passes proximity check without derivative echoes.</comment>
