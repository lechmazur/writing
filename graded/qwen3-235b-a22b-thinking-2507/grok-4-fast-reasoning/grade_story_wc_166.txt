<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Motivation clear (defying nostalgia ban) but lacks contradictory impulses; pain is embodied yet interior struggle remains abstract ("essence rooting into earth" feels conceptual rather than visceral. No visible trade-offs in her renunciation of exile.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural closure succeeds via Charged Poise: the fledged verse reconfigures exile with conceptual cost (pain as "dark rose"). Orientation solid early, but cost—while present—lacks deepening; the anchoring "gift/curse" isn’t tested under pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Twilight garden’s luminous fungi and obsidian paths create vivid atmosphere, but environment doesn’t constrain choices—it’s backdrop, not active pressure. Moonstone dust (micro-setting) charges the final image, yet dominant setting misses 9+ gate requiring tactical constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes (defying ban through art) signaled early, but conflict lacks meaningful escalation: "observing gaps" method works flawlessly without resistance. Pressure accumulates texturally yet never narrows options or forces adaptation, missing the band guardrail for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "voids where light retreats" imagery, avoiding moralizing. Final stars "etching approval" offers resonant non-literal answer to exile’s cost. But nostalgia ban’s implications aren’t interrogated deeply—theme stays lyrical without sufficient complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("callused from dancing waves") and tidal rhythm shine, yet climax cadence subtly falters: three near-identical "by observing gaps..." phrases dilute pressure. No head-hopping, but minor syntactic repetition under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lush and precise, but "pain bloomed like a dark rose" creates mixed metaphor (pain doesn’t bloom like a rose), and template cadence in the fledging sequence ("by observing gaps...") slightly dulls climax. No closure artifacts, yet hairline slips prevent 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Fledging" cosmic verse transforms nostalgia into fresh metaphor, and obsidian grace motif elevates the premise. But elective exile and nostalgia ban feel like familiar tropes without radical reconfiguration—lacks the risk-taking synthesis for 9.0.</comment>
