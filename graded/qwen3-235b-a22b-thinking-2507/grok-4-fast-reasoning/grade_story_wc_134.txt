<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses during climax; "panic surged" relies on label over embodied struggle. Motivation for touching pearl feels under-conflicted despite strong setup. No visible trade-off between magic amplification and self-preservation during critical beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost but lens ambiguity weakens escalation. Shadows' threat emerges too late without prior causal hints; possession lacks meaningful tightening through Elara's choices. Final image's cost ("forever changed") remains slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cave functions as micro-setting that constrains action (crystals drown cries, sync with pearl) and charges final image. Bioluminescent quartz and singing crystals directly pressure choices, though "coral-like formation" detail feels ornamental. Meets 9+ gate via environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (amplify magic vs. self-preservation) signaled early but escalation lacks protagonist agency. Possession driven by external forces, not Elara's decisions; no visible price altering tactics. Band guardrail for 8.8+ unmet as final image lacks tangible cost demonstration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: pearl symbolizes dangerous allure of power, "bright darkness" finale reweights premise without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; wisdom earned via struggle. Final image ("seeing unseen forces within") offers resonant non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature ("luminous gloom that played tricks") with consistent focalization. Minor tense drift ("she had arrived" vs. present action) creates slight disorientation. Rhythmic control under stress excellent, but "mineral tears wept by stone" overreaches lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clean prose but scaffold loops ("steadily unpredictable" x3) and minor purple prose ("mineral tears"). Final paragraph's "forever changed" slightly sentimental. No closure artifacts, but "overlapping shadows" description in climax has density issues obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh geological magic system transforms possession trope, but "clairvoyant outwitted" premise lacks bold risk. Emotional truth elevates it; cave's sonic logic feels specific. Transformation test passed – wouldn't work with generic seer – yet missing one truly unconventional structural choice.</comment>
