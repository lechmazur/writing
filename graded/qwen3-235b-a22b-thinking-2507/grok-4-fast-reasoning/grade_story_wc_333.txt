<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels ("improbable longing") without concrete embodiment; diagnostic phrasing like "fear had disoriented her" triggers -0.5 penalty. Locksmith effectively pressures Elara's choice but lacks distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with the retied ribbon, but cost remains conceptual rather than dramatized—no visible sacrifice or irreversible change on page to satisfy cost proof test. Orientation disorientation pays off at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Starlight and nexus create vivid atmosphere, but setting never constrains choices; cosmic backdrop remains decorative rather than functional pressure. Micro-setting opportunity (hair/ribbon) missed for tactical impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes stay abstract ("fear trapping ideas") without visceral test; the ribbon unwinding lacks tangible cost—no struggle, hesitation, or consequence alters tactics. Tightening occurs but without earned trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through cosmic reunion motif, but final "quiet resolve" edges toward thematic echo; avoids moralizing yet misses non-literal closure by stating transformation rather than charging it through image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct cosmic lexicon ("hush of possibility," "twilight hues") sustains Accumulative lens, but repetitive "enveloped secrets" phrasing in climax creates scaffold loop. Psychic distance shifts flawlessly with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops: "enveloped secrets" repeats 4× with near-identical phrasing in critical beats; "disorient/disorienting" appears 5×. Final paragraph's synonym churn ("unlocked at last"/"heart unlocked") dulls closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms reunion trope through cosmic texture and Earned Stasis closure; avoids safety-middle with bold "fear trapping ideas" metaphor. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies—conceptual fear-lock echoes common tropes without fresh inflection.</comment>
