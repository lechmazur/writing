<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("dream of solitary life" vs "empire's call") intensifies through embodied "mulberry ache" and micro-choices like hesitating over violin strings; final choice earned by plant telepathy's pressure and coffee stain visions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "destiny no longer perforated but purposefully porous" crystallizes stance with felt cost (regret→resolve), but lens ambiguity in midpoint ("propagate destinies" ritual feels causal in accumulative design) prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Velvet observatory micro-setting constrains choice (violin's coolness against summer swelter) and charges final image ("velvet embraced her"); "mulberry ache" motif evolves from abstract sorrow to resolved texture without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("weigh dream against empire") tightens through coffee stain visions and plant telepathy's pressure, but empire consequences remain abstract; "mended horizon" reflection provides conceptual cost yet lacks visceral tactical shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of "perforated destiny" resolves through final image ("purposefully porous") without moralizing, but coffee stain visions over-explain ("crown splintered by thorns" literalizes metaphor), diluting earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mulberry ache," "frozen light pulsing") modulates under pressure; psychic distance shifts intentionally during violin play; no head-hopping despite plant telepathy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops but "mulberry ache" reused as sensation/metaphor in adjacent lines; "propagate destinies" explanation momentarily stalls momentum with reflection, though closure remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of provenance research + ice violin prophecy feels inevitable; "perforated destiny" trope transformed through coffee stains and telepathic plants, though midsummer observatory risks cliché without velvet/plant specificity.</comment>
