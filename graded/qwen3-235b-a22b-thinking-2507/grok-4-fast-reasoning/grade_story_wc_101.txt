<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation (intergenerational legacy) drives every choice; her embodied restraint—pulling the girl into the arbor while murmuring warnings—reveals contradictory impulses: protect youth yet empower them. Flaw: "heart swelling with motivation" edges toward label-speak without deeper physiological contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bell’s dawn ringing crystallizes their shift from anonymity to alliance with visible cost (escalated drone risks). Orientation clear by para 2; Accumulative lens holds as food runs deepen into intergenerational pacts. Missing micro-choice during declaration slightly blurs causality at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor’s "weathered benches" and "parched earth" constrain choices—Elara uses its "embrace" for safety—while the bell’s patina charges the final image. Sensory specificity ("rustle of leaves," "distant hum of drones") mirrors internal states without cliché; environment actively pressures tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sanctions tighten options meaningfully: anonymous runs → formalized pacts with heightened risk. Elara’s agency drives escalation (gathering community, declaring pacts), but "risks mounted—drones swept closer" lacks on-page demonstration of narrowed tactics, softening the cost’s immediacy before closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: bell’s shift from relic to covenant symbol reweights "amplified quiet" as resilience, not silence. Final image—"survival into strength, anonymity into alliance"—resonates without moralizing. Near-miss: "threads stitching grandparents' tales" slightly over-explains legacy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "lives measured in whispers," "patina whispering of festivals" filter setting through Elara’s exile lens. Voice modulates perfectly under pressure—breathless youth dialogue contrasts her "gently persistent" cadence. No POV slippage; rhythm accelerates during runs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion excels ("steps soft on the parched earth"), but "amplified quiet" repeats three times with diminishing returns; third instance ("air held that amplified quiet") becomes scaffold. Near-closure density stumbles slightly on rhythmic monotony during the declaration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sanctions reframed as intergenerational test rather than political allegory. Specific details (scavenged potatoes, weaver’s family donations) ground universal themes. Risk-taking elevates stakes—the formalized pact’s vulnerability feels earned, not gimmicky—but "exiled valley" lacks distinctive geography.</comment>
