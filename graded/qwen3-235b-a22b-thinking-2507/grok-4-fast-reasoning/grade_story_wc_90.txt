<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority lacks embodied contradiction; pacifism stated but not tested through physical micro-choices when facing violent shadows (e.g., no system override or hesitation during stitching).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the tear-fractured light key and ghosts' release reconfigure options with conceptual cost ("shadows recede like mist before dawn"), though emotional cost remains slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Recycled spaceship micro-setting constrains every choice: low gravity enables buoyancy shift, cracked viewports filter starlight for the method, and decaying systems pressure the ritual’s urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via Elias’s lightness—a visible price that alters tactics (rising complicates chamber work)—but the cost feels underweighted against the cosmic scale of "locked dimension" resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tapestry stitch: "weaving pain into understanding" avoids moralizing, while the final image of ghosts finding peace answers the central question without stated morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("shadows lingered—unresolved fragments"), with syntax tightening under ritual pressure; no head-hopping despite multi-POV potential in shadow visions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor density issues in ritual description ("faint shimmer of long-dried tears on faded photographs" slightly overwrought), but propulsion remains strong with zero loops in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of pacifist AI and shadow work feels inevitable; "gravitationally lighter when happy" transforms cosmic horror tropes through emotional specificity.</comment>
