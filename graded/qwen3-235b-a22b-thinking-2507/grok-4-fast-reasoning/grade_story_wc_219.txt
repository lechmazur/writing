<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Galileo bust moment ("why bow to stars that now conversed back?"), but final epiphany edges toward thematic statement ("rebellion academic no more") slightly undercutting embodied cost. Micro-choices like footprint analysis reveal values cleanly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: Elara setting down the amber with envoys' nod crystallizes "rebellious fusion" with felt cost (skepticism transformed). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through bronze-thread motif; rain's return charges final image with renewal cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tower setting actively constrains choice—mud slows ascent, alcove enables discovery—while rainwashed stone and amber resin charge the final image. Sensory specificity ("ochre footprints," "metallic tang of rain-slicked iron") filters through Elara’s academic lens flawlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding homecoming chemistry) tightens via amber discovery, but envoys' convergence resolves tension through coincidence rather than protagonist agency. Cost (academic identity surrender) is legible in smile "doubts alight," though escalation lacks meaningful protagonist-driven complication before climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "rebellious fusion" crystallizes via amber's dual origin, rejecting binaries. Final image (rain washing tower as world "converged toward dawn") resonates without moralizing. Avoids "thematic echo" by embedding insight in tactile action (setting down amber).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exquisite—academic skepticism colors every observation ("dismantle fragile truths"). Rhythmic control peaks in climax: short clauses ("She set the amber down") mirror resolution. Zero head-hopping despite multi-POV envoys; their silence maintains focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose soars with purposeful density ("cosmic whisper that had shattered old certainties"), but "luminous skepticism" repeats as near-synonym ("luminous like her own skeptical fire"), triggering minor scaffold penalty. Final line’s "unspoken dawn" avoids overwriting while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms first-contact tropes via "chemistry of homecoming" premise—alien biology in amber reframes reunion as molecular echo. Bold risk: quiet resolution without dialogue. Derivative guardrail avoided by anchoring wonder in academic rebellion ("rebellion academic no more" feels earned).</comment>
