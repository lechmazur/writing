<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (gift/curse of ghost-sight) and embodied emotion (calloused hands steady despite chill) drive micro-choices like dust analysis. Final renunciation of ghosts' burden earned through ledger discovery, but "light release from burdens that float eternally" edges toward thematic echo in closure beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with dust-pattern density shift reweighting stakes. Charged Poise closure crystallizes options with felt cost (ghosts' sighs), but intrusive "Wait, that's over—adjusting for count" disrupts causality in the critical ledger-reveal beat, muddying the cost legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dust motes as micro-setting constrain every choice (kneeling analysis, tracing patterns) and charge the final image ("dust patterns mapping escape routes"). Recurring object-as-setting meets 9+ gate by evolving from visual detail to investigative tool that directly enables closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Protagonist agency drives escalation: dust analysis narrows options to ceiling panel, leading to ledger discovery. Conceptual cost (ghosts' embezzlement-caused torment) is unmistakable in "burden lifting" moment, though fluorescent buzz's time pressure isn't fully leveraged beyond initial disorientation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (dust trails, barrel engravings), avoiding moralizing until the final phrase "light release from burdens that float eternally" risks thematic echo by stating the resonance rather than letting the barrel-ledger-gesture sequence imply it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (technician's precision in dust analysis) modulates under pressure, but "Wait, that's over—adjusting for count" breaks focalization with intrusive meta-commentary, undermining voice consistency at the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong opening rhythm and textural specificity ("ticket stubs scattered like confetti") degrade under scaffold loops ("Wait..."; "No, recount properly") clustered in the closure beat, dulling the final image's propulsion and triggering −0.7 artifact penalty for closure-touched prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elevator tech/ghost-seer in abandoned circus avoids trope clichés through specific occupational lens (dust-pattern forensics). "Ceilings hide burdens" premise transformed by tangible mechanics (barrel as key), though fluorescent buzz timing lacks distinctive inflection.</comment>
