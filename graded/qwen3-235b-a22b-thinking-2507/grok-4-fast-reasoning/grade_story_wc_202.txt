<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction manifests physically ("breath caught") as grief and duty collide; final choice to unfasten seal is earned through childhood trauma and scars aligning with painting, with visible cost in merged timelines.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when barriers dissolve—"childhood and now merging... anchors finally whole" reconfigures loss into connection with undeniable emotional cost, under Accumulative/Textural lens sustained from opening "eternal instant" motif.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse lens fragment functions as micro-setting: its physical handling (tracing, holding to eye) constrains choices and charges closure when warming during dissolution, transforming from memory object to active tool that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single deepening—painting's hidden details—narrow options through protagonist agency (whispering translation), with cost crystallized in "childhood and now merging" where acceptance of permanent loss reweights the stakes under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image ("between-worlds no longer a chasm but a shared breath") reweights the central question through concrete action (unfastening seal), avoiding moralizing while embracing complexity—honoring history requires integrating loss, not erasing it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "gut's quiet pull" and "elusively tangible" phrasing; syntax compresses under pressure ("breath caught") while maintaining rhythmic control that mirrors emotional shifts without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line multiplies meaning ("lanterns flickered as if breathing" establishes setting, foreshadows dissolution, and modulates tone), with figurative language precise even in climax ("warming as barriers dissolved").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "lost parent" trope via concrete synthesis: between-worlds translation theory fused with physical artifact (lens fragment), where honoring history requires accepting irreversible loss—risk-taking elevates stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
