<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority avoids labels but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; micro-choices like stone-throwing don't reveal value hierarchies with visible cost. Final renunciation feels intellectually consistent but emotionally untested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with density escalation via ripple patterns, but cost proof fails: the "might not return unchanged" warning remains abstract without concrete on-page sacrifice. Orientation anchors by word 40.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sycamore shadows and stone weight constrain choices (e.g., ripple patterns = aging inversion method). Final image charges the pond as micro-setting where "vanishing became the gateway," meeting 9+ gate via closure linkage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reversing aging through surrender) tightens via ripple revelations, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—truths emerge passively in trance. The withheld warning deepens stakes but conceptual cost feels unanchored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ripples as aging inversion method, avoiding moralizing. Final line ("vanishing became the gateway") offers resonant answer without stating moral, though "teach vanishing to appear" edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains meditative rhythm with character-specific perception ("sycamore hush," "woven moments"), but stress-response fails: syntax stays uniformly ornate during high-pressure climax instead of compressing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Figurative density blurs stakes in climax ("broadest and slowest ring held a withheld warning"); 80% of final beat uses stacked metaphors. Template cadence in ripple descriptions ("first ring whispered... deeper rings revealed") dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chronal science and spiritual surrender via lodestone grotto, with emotional specificity in "failed serums" backstory. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
