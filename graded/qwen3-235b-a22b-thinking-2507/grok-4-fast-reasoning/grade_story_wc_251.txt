<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in Elias's "humble rebellion" versus town conformity is embodied through tactile chess king cradling; micro-choices like recruiting shopkeepers via "subtle nods" reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Mira's arrival lacks sufficient status dynamics to deepen relationship-as-crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with stars wheeling overhead as the grotto "hummed, drawing in unspoken words of thoughtful revolt"—reconfiguring stakes with conceptual cost. Orientation Test fails: no temporal anchor by 120 words (modern? historical?), capping Q3 at 7.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cobalt library's mist and magnetic grotto constrain choices (Elias reviewing map in fractured light), but setting details like "lodestone tugging compasses" remain decorative. Orientation penalty applied in Q2 caps score; environment doesn't charge final image sufficiently for 9+ band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias's agency in organizing displays, with cost legible in Mira's "unspoken fears" and elders dismissing rebellion as "evening haze." Escalation lacks meaningful on-page reversal—window displays ignite without showing Elias's active choice during execution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges through "forests of second thoughts" motif reweighted at closure: saplings of change become "thoughtful revolt." Avoids moralizing but Mira's "strategy outmaneuvered silence" borders on thematic echo (-0.3 penalty), preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cobalt veins," "amplified quiet") filters sensory details through Elias's coaching lens. Minor register drift when describing elders as "watching from their spire" feels narrator-imposed rather than character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with "fractured light" and "doubts blooming into curiosity," but "forests of second thoughts" repeats verbatim three times with synonym churn ("germinating," "saplings"), triggering -0.4 artifact penalty in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms rebellion trope through specific "synchronized window displays" and magnetic grotto's lodestone physics. Fresh inflection in using chess coaching as metaphor for societal change, though "robed elders" verge on stock imagery.</comment>
