<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via embodied choices: trembling hands selecting pockmarks while lungs burn, quilting regrets into resolve with visible cost. No diagnostic labels—only sensory stakes like "sting of loss, not erased but gilded." Final endurance as earned stasis lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: workshop steadies as Elias exhales "in creation," sea recedes, charm dims—cost legible in "forever changed" with conceptual weight. Orientation nailed in opening line; Accumulative lens holds through memory quilting. Minor lurching workshop beat slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Acid sea actively gnaws workshop edges, constraining every choice—pontoons hiss, gears grind as tide rises. Micro-setting triumph: key ring charm’s runes glow/dim, charging final image. Would collapse without this environment’s visceral pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (meaning vs oblivion) tightens through Elias’s narration choices as acid rises. Agency drives escalation: selecting pockmarks narrows options, "workshop lurched" beat shows cost altering tactics. Sea’s encroachment reweights stakes relentlessly under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "quilting regrets into resolve" reweights kintsugi as earned wisdom, not stated moral. Final image ("narrated scars now a beacon") resonates non-literally with conceptual cost—no thematic echo, only concrete particulars charging closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes via alchemist’s gaze: "tarnished trinket etched with forgotten runes," steam vents threading voice. Rhythm modulates under pressure—short gasps during lurching workshop. "Dire enchantment" repetition slightly dilutes peak tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion via concrete verbs ("acid gnawed," "gears whirred"). Every sentence multi-tasks: "key ring charm dangled... suspending time" advances plot/atmosphere. Near-perfect density—only "dire enchantment" phrasing borders on repetition in final beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms kintsugi from trope into narrative engine: memory quilting physically mends soul via pockmark matching. Acid sea setting isn’t backdrop but active pressure—fresh synthesis where "fraying life" meets "venomous tide." Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
