<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation "to articulate unspoken needs" remains told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; no friction between her "seldom-heard" nature and bold graffiti act. Critical absence of contradictory impulses during encoding sequence undermines closure weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost as ghost emerges, but "driftingly alert" trait fails Orientation Test—promised function undemonstrated when she "stumbles" upon artifact. Lens ambiguity in midpoint weakens accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cloud-blossoms as micro-setting charge closure: pigments enable graffiti encoding, then "mending" action transforms them into legacy. Mist spatially choreographs ghost’s emergence, making environment indispensable to final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through atmospheric pressure (lightning intervals), but ghost’s release lacks tangible cost—no trade-off when bolt plate merges with mural. Agency feels unearned as encoding succeeds without struggle or sacrificed option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Mending unspoken voids" skirts thematic echo but avoids moralizing via concrete action. Final image reweights "bolted dreams" into luminous freedom, though "mending" slightly overstates the earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "luminous cloud-blossoms" and "binary blooms," but "driftingly alert" repetition creates template cadence. Voice modulates well under pressure yet converges during thunder’s approach.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Final paragraph’s "mending the unspoken voids" uses therapy-speak that violates balladeer’s lexicon. "Tinkersong wonder" repetition and "driftingly alert" cadence loops dull immediacy near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "ghost in code" trope through brass-and-bloom synesthesia; "bolt plate as canvas" reconfiguration feels inevitable. Risks lyric compression but pays off via cloud-blossom pigments charging closure image.</comment>
