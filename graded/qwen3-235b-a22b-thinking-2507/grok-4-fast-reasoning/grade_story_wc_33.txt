<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "respectfully rebellious" shines via micro-choices (pocketing envelope), but widow's off-page absence limits relationship crucible; final realization avoids epiphany cliché by rooting in drone's physical cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "mail became memory's bridge" reconfigures premise with conceptual cost of years-long absence; causal escalation holds from drone activation to patrol evasion with tangible risk ("crackle echoing faintly").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cobalt arcade constrains every choice (neutral launch zone, rationed power masking drone sounds) and charges the final image as "sanctuary of secrets"; sensory details ("ozone from flickering screens") reflect mailman's professional attention.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single escalation—drone breaching patrol scans via bottled storm—narrows options meaningfully; cost is visceral in "tension coiling" and crackle echo, though secondary stake (sibling bond) lacks sufficient friction against primary mission.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "linking absences" literally weaves hope, avoiding moralizing; final line "mail became memory's bridge" reweights prior material without abstraction, earning resonance through drone's physical journey.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cobalt veins pulsing faint blue," "mosaic floors") filters all details through mailman's eyes; rhythmic control tightens under pressure ("wings whispering as it lifted") without elision artifacts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but "respectfully rebellious" label repeats without deeper embodiment; minor overwriting in "thunderstorm in a bottle" description risks diluting high-pressure beats despite purposeful metaphor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms war-trope via specific mechanics (bottled storm powering drone, "linking absences" method); emotional truth in small acts (pocketing envelope) avoids sentimentality while risking lyrical density in closure.</comment>
