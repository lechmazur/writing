<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elowen's contradictory patience/action drives choices, but Thorne's motivation lacks embodied conflict; "understood" tells rather than shows internal shift during pivotal step-syncing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis succeeds with conceptual cost (spiritual revival vs physical decay), but "rebuild complete in spirit" edges toward thematic echo, narrowly avoiding final-paragraph penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cobblestones function as micro-setting constraining every choice; vibrations charging the final image satisfy 9+ gate, though archway runes lack causal integration beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via accumulating footsteps altering vibration density, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—Elowen merely guides, never confronts resistance to pressure buildup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through resonant particulars (footsteps as community), but "balance restored" in final line triggers near-thematic-echo penalty (-0.6) by stating the answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("wild hush woven into vibration") shines, but uniform lyrical cadence flattens emotional peaks; no head-hopping but stress compression feels unearned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Figurative density muddles key beats ("shard of midnight" + "heartbeat dormant" in one sentence); paraphrase loops on "wild hush" persist into final third, disallowing 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound physics and community collapse avoids tropes, but "ghost town revival" framework lacks sufficient risk-taking to breach high-band gate.</comment>
