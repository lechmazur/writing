<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion through shell-tending and feather handling, but lacks contradictory impulses before epiphany; motivation to find beauty in incomplete is consistent yet resolves too neatly without prior struggle against competing desires.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with visible cost ("heart catching" at snapped string) and conceptual repricing of the feather; drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through "woven dawns" motif, though kite loss resolution feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cobalt lagoon functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (reflecting "quiet resolve"), but doesn't constrain choices; sensory details are purposeful yet lack causal pressure on tactics during key beats like the kite launch.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through kite string snap's felt cost, narrowing Elara's options to acceptance; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, but agency feels passive at climax where external wind—not character choice—triggers the pivotal loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "woven dawns" reweighted by the feather's broken iridescence; final image ("art of harmonizing what remained") delivers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("burnished hush," "warmly attentive") modulates with emotional intensity; one filter-verb ("she felt the burnished hush deepen") slightly dulls immediacy during peak pressure of the snap.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythm ("But as the wind gusted sharper..." accelerates tension), though "harmonizing the discord" repetition risks slight cadence echo in final beats without deepening pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Woven dawns" synthesizes familiar concepts through specific shell/feather/kite details; risk-taking in quiet closure pays off, but shoreline poet trope lacks transformative freshness in core premise execution.</comment>
