<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias' "fortified vulnerability," but "diagnostic label-speak" in "fortified vulnerability defined Elias's approach" risks therapy-speak. Final shard-pocketing choice earns closure through prior causality, though emotional progression edges toward tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost: "vulnerability cracked open; the vulnerability of Clara’s escape fortified his determination." Orientation anchors by word 40, lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through the lantern’s memory-triggered reconfiguration of stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tunnel setting constrains choice via "shallow puddles," "rusted walls," and the lantern’s weight. Final image ("ignite his own liberty’s flame") charges the recurring object with cost, though "mold and unearthed soil" sensory details occasionally stall momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs bureau control) tightens via Elias’ agency: his empirical observation reveals sabotage. Cost is visceral in "vulnerability cracked open," but the lantern’s warmth transition feels slightly convenient, softening escalation’s pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("flashlight cutting through humid gloom like a hesitant blade") persists under pressure. Rhythmic control in the vision sequence ("Clara’s fear reverberated through Elias") avoids head-hopping, though "fortified vulnerability" phrasing momentarily disrupts voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops in closure beat; "shard of the lantern’s glass as talisman" shows textural specificity. Minor overwriting in "hinge worn smooth by countless furtive opens and closes" slightly muddles a high-pressure beat without harming propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drought-ravaged subway with Underground Railroad history avoids trope. "Liberty’s Flame" motif transforms generic symbolism through specific causal pressure, though entangled memories device edges toward familiar territory without full reinvention.</comment>
