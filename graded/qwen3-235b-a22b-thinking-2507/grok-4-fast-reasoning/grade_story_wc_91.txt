<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in destitution vs. generosity is concrete, but motivation ("texture of transformation") remains abstractly told without sufficient embodied conflict during key choices; micro-choices (detour, releasing bugs) reveal values yet lack deeper friction between want/fear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: Elias's realization ("gritty silk of change") reconfigures stakes with visible cost (ongoing destitution), but the prophecy coincidence risks resolving rather than complicating pressure; elder's legend appears too late to feel earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Black sand beach constrains choices (detour path, releasing bugs) and charges the final image ("beach's black grains etched with glow"); sensory details (sulfur/salt air, phosphorescent shells) are purposeful and POV-filtered, avoiding generic symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding transformation) tightens via Elias's actions, but resolution leans on external prophecy coincidence rather than protagonist agency; cost (enduring destitution) is legible yet the accidental fulfillment undercuts escalation's causal integrity under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from fireflies' release and phosphorescent shells; final image reweights "transformation" as gritty renewal without moralizing, though "vibrant hush" repetition occasionally borders on thematic echo without deepening complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("callused fingers brushing cool glass," "pockets echoed with emptiness") modulates rhythm under pressure; no POV slippage despite elder's off-page observation, maintaining consistent focalization on Elias's sensory experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, but stacked modifiers ("slow dance of celestial bodies—stars wheeling in silent pirouettes") risk figurative muddle in opening; final image avoids overwriting yet "gritty silk of change" slightly over-articulates the earned insight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of destitution/prophecy through specific details (bottled fireflies as "living lanterns," obsidian paths), but celestial prophecy trope slightly softens risk; emotional truth in Elias's quiet endurance elevates beyond familiar templates.</comment>
