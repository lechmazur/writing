<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority rich but "denote" jargon breaks causality; "expectantly resigned" trait lacks visible tradeoffs despite strong embodied emotion in choir breakthrough scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("uncertain chord") lands with conceptual cost; orientation perfect but "across unlearning hatred" timeframe ambiguity caps escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Velvet library constrains choice (zither placement on cushioned table); autumn setting charges final image yet "traveled stillness" overuse dilutes sensory specificity in middle beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via subtraction method but "denote" vagueness weakens agency; pressure tightens meaningfully though cost remains abstract until final image crystallizes uncertainty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through zither rosette braiding metaphor; avoids moralizing but "vanishing arts" concept stated too directly in climax, nearly triggering thematic echo penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("crimson drapes pooling like spilled wine") yet dialogue convergence at emotional peaks flattens character voices during breakthrough scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Overwritten climax ("denoted the crescendo by subtracting final noises") with synonym churn; strong opening rhythm derailed by template cadence in unlearning sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "vanishing arts" via zither's fragility yet stock trio (poet/worker/violinist) limits risk; emotional specificity in unlearning elevates beyond template.</comment>
