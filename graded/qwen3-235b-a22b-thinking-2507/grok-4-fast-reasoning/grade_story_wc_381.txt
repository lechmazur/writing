<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "tranquil blaze" recurs as static tic without genuine struggle. Strength: embodied cost (sweat, trembling wing) during ritual. Weakness: no visible flaw complicating choices or friction between wants/fears.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Orientation perfect (who/where/when anchored by line 3), closure valid Earned Stasis with cost (sweat, sealed wing). But escalation fails: ritual proceeds without meaningful resistance or deepening—brook "responds" but never opposes. Two distinct non-closure issues (-1.5 cap).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Brook constrains choice (water's flow channels ritual) and charges final image ("flow now a testament to peace"). Sensory details reflect urgency: crisis narrows to "invisible lines" traced. Avoids overt symbolism—environment evolves causally (current quickens, carries code fragments).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early but pressure static: prophecy threat never manifests concretely. No tightening—ritual unfolds predictably without narrowing options. Cost (sweat) lacks emotional/strategic weight. Agency passive; brook "responded" rather than Elar overcoming resistance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "smoothed hush" reweighted in closure (brook's flow as peace). Avoids moralizing; final image offers non-literal answer. Weakness: "terrestrially cosmic peace" skirts thematic echo. Strength: prophecy's dissolution shows complexity—no tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("moonlight danced like fleeting spirits") with rhythmic control in calm moments. But high-pressure ritual sequence defaults to uniform "He [verb]" cadence ("closed... began... visualized... completed"), dulling immediacy under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong opening rhythm, but climax overwrites: "cosmic threads wove... stars mirroring runes" stacks metaphors during high-pressure beat. Template cadence in ritual sequence ("He closed... began... visualized") triggers -0.5 artifact penalty. Final line resonates cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Terrestrially cosmic" transforms familiar summoner trope through specific execution (origami wing, mapping silence). Fresh inflection: dissolving prophecy via brook's flow. But emotional specificity lacks—Elar's serenity feels unearned, risking safety-middle hedging.</comment>
