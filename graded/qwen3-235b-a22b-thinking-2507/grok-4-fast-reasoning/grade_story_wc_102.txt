<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion in healing sequence, but "spiritually curious soul" labels weaken interiority; micro-choices like breath-syncing reveal values, though old man lacks depth beyond plot function.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: petals weaving into skin shows visible cost; Accumulative lens holds through breath-synchronized projections, but healing resolution lacks sufficient struggle escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Twilight viaduct functions as micro-setting charging closure—luminous flowers actively mend flesh; "foggy lucidity" permeates sensory hierarchy and final image without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully through breath-synchronization deepening, but "unused love" abstraction dilutes visceral cost; pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens yet lacks concrete tactical tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through camera obscura projections and breath mechanics, avoiding moralizing; final image ("heart's quiet archive") reweights premise without stated moral, though Kwan Yin's tear borders on symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("foggy lucidity" as mental/state filter) with rhythmic control; minor register drift in "pilgrim of sparks" cliché, but voice modulates powerfully under healing pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density in projection sequence, but scaffold phrasing ("spiritually curious nature pulling her closer") dulls immediacy; no closure-impacting loops, yet synonym churn in bloom descriptions slightly slows momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of camera obscura mechanics with spiritual quest; transforms "unused love" trope through breathing-as-archive concept, though past-life romance element lacks sufficient risk-taking differentiation.</comment>
