<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in dice ritual and "balancedly daring" tension; micro-choices like equation sketching reveal hierarchy of values. Slight over-articulation in "proving that staircase's geometry hid a flaw" edges toward diagnostic phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with visceral cost ("fingers brushing phantom warmth"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density shifts. Midpoint ambiguity in lens teaching slightly weakens escalation before rupture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Staircase setting charges final image ("peeling back layers like onion skin") and constrains every choice; sensory details like "dust-caked step" and "sourceless light" reflect urgency. Chipped die's texture perfectly functions as micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through mathematical escalation ("rupture point... singularity"), narrowing options to one decisive act. Cost ("phantom warmth" of missed opportunity) charges closure, but internal/external conflict interweaving could be tighter pre-climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "texture" motif reweighted at closure; avoids moralizing while "captured possibility" resonates conceptually. Final image ("chipped one whole in palm") offers non-literal answer to regret without stating thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in mathematical diction ("differential equation balancing daring ascent"); rhythmic control under pressure. Slight register drift in "topological tear" momentarily jars Elias's plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in climax; "surgical rift" exemplifies precise propulsion. "Balancedly daring" adverb feels forced and unmotivated by voice, triggering −0.2 per patterned-artifact penalty in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mathematical regret and physical escape; "texture of missed opportunity" transforms perpetual motion trope. Risk-taking (abstract stakes made visceral) heightens coherence without gimmickry, fulfilling 9+ quick test.</comment>
