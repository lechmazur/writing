<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority leans on abstract labels ("hauntingly optimistic," "broken precedents") without embodied contradiction; micro-choices under pressure lack specificity despite strong motivation. Final communal shift feels earned but cost remains conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with villagers' arrival, but cost feels under-dramatized—conceptual "reverence" lacks tangible stakes. Orientation anchors swiftly (<120 words), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds cohesively through sewing repetitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting vividly anchors atmosphere (crimson cliffs, tide pools), but the labyrinth functions decoratively rather than constraining choices. The storybook plate qualifies as micro-setting charging the final image, narrowly clearing the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stakes ("ruin to reverence") remain abstractly declared without meaningful escalation—sleepwalking sewing encounters no resistance or tactical cost. Dominant stake signals early but pressure never tightens; villagers' arrival resolves without prior friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through weaving motif and cracked plate, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("labyrinth transformed into living poem") offers resonant non-literal answer, but conceptual cost of "broken precedents" lacks felt urgency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice maintains poetic consistency with distinct perceptual signature ("orchid solace," "mineral tears"), though rhythmic control occasionally falters in high-pressure sewing sequences. No head-hopping; focalization stays anchored to Elara's trance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high density and purposeful rhythm ("splintered docks and silenced songs"), with minimal scaffold. Minor synonym loops ("fractured world into something sacred"/"stitching the dark with light’s embrace") prevent 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ingenuity lies in sleepwalking as communal bridge, but "optimistic artisan heals ruins" trope lacks transformation. Specific crimson canyon details elevate, yet core premise echoes familiar renewal arcs without distinctive moral calculus.</comment>
