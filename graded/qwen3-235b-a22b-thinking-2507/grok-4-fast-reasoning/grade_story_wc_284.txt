<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "prudently daring" manifesting as cautious kneeling yet bold carving, but "unused courage stirred... awakening like earth" risks abstract labeling without sufficient embodied cost in that peak moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: Marcus's "hollow eyes" crystallize the betrayal's cost while their joint decoding forecloses isolation, with Causal lens holding through snow code mechanics and footsteps escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zephyr Bluff's snow constrains choices (kneeling to feel ridges, stylus use), while mist beading "like silver tears" charges the final image; avoids cliché through tactile integration with Elara's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's snow-tracing (agency narrowing options), with Marcus's arrival raising cost via his "hollow eyes"—though "fixing what's broken" could feel more viscerally urgent earlier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through snow codes and pillbox, but "To fix us" dialogue states the thesis too directly, slightly undercutting earned resonance of their silent decoding work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "mist clung like forgotten whispers" and pressure-appropriate compression; voice modulates perfectly from hushed anticipation to tense reunion without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or muddle, but "prudently daring" repeats 3x with diminishing concrete payoff, and "silver hush" overuse slightly dulls final image's freshness despite strong propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spy tropes via snow code mechanics and pillbox-as-bridge, though "tilt of earth toward spring" leans slightly on familiar seasonal metaphor without full transformation.</comment>
