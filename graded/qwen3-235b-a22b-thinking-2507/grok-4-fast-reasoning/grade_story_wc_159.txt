<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elowen’s motivation to preserve forgotten names is embodied through orchid care and chime mending, with regret deepening her endurance. However, "foxglove regret" repeats as label-only phrasing in peak beats, weakening embodied contradiction during the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as Elowen persists amid deepening regret, with cost felt in "weight of loss pressed like clouds below." Orientation is anchored by line 3, but the opal bead ignition lacks sufficient struggle to crystallize the cost proof test decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The glass orchids function as micro-setting that constrains choices (mending via song, not glue) and charges the final image as they "shimmer with borrowed light." Environment actively shapes tactics through tools like the quartz slab and phosphorescent bark.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elowen’s agency (finding tube → singing → lighting bead), but the bamboo chime’s "protesting abandonment" feels coincidental rather than earned escalation. Regret’s deepening cost is felt but lacks concrete tactical alteration in the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "Elyria" chimes evoking extinct feelings, with final image reweighting preservation as "fragile victory" against oblivion. No moralizing—only "weight of loss" and "quiet defiance" charge the closure without stated morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "dust like toxic blush of foxglove petals," but "gently systematic" repeats 4x without stress modulation. Rhythmic control falters during mending with repetitive stems ("she carried," "she prepared," "she closed").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, though "foxglove regret" and "systematically gentle" create minor synonym loops. No closure-dulling artifacts, but "fracture sealing not physically but in harmony" risks figurative muddle in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Museum of extinct feelings" transforms library tropes through specific mechanics (opal bead ignition, song-based mending). Emotional truth avoids novelty-for-novelty, but opal/cloud setting leans slightly familiar, missing full inevitability in hindsight.</comment>
