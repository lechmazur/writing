<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (loyalty vs freedom) drive blood ritual; cost visible in thorn surrender. No therapy-speak; embodied stakes crystallize through micro-choices like tracing key engravings.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with blood ritual cost; stalactite drip anchors time. Orientation clear by line 3; Accumulative lens holds through aurora's pulse reconfiguring stakes without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Marble sanctuary constrains every choice: water pools enable blood ritual, fissures channel aurora for writing. Final "pearl twilight of her soul's quiet dawn" charges closure with setting-as-body metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Internal stake (forgiving abandonment) escalates through deepening, not external events. Blood ritual narrows options irrevocably; cost legible in "thorn no longer piercing her resolve" as stakes transform from void to scar.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "calibrated treason" becoming forgiveness; final image ("forged not just documents but her own redemption") reweights prior material without moralizing. No thematic echo in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature evident in "pearl twilight glow" filtering emotions; rhythmic control during blood ritual avoids lyric drift. Zero head-hopping; voice modulates from trembling to "faint smile" under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ancient rhythm into shallow pools" demonstrates multi-jobbing prose. Minor deduction for "calibrated treason against her own heart" slightly muddling the scalpel metaphor in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synthesizes calligraphy forgery with soul-unlinking into inevitable emotional calculus. Risk-taking heightens stakes: pure interior journey transforms "treason" trope through specific blood ritual mechanics.</comment>
