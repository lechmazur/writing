<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clear motivation as voice of the unknown, but interior contradiction under pressure is underdeveloped; fossil discovery triggers immediate epiphany without struggle. "Diagnostic label-speak" in climax narration ("speak for the forgotten winds") undermines embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong orientation and Accumulative/Textural lens (emotional heat-map density), but closure lacks legible cost. Charged Poise ending crystallizes options yet fails "cost proof test"—no visible sacrifice or altered tactics after fossil discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, profession-filtered sensory details (bioluminescent algae, thermal signatures) anchor setting. Micro-setting (fossil) charges final image as "compass for the soul," satisfying 9+ gate despite not constraining choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving history for hibernators) signaled early, but pressure stagnates. Finding fossil deepens mission without narrowing options or raising cost—no meaningful tightening under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of bridging epochs emerges from particulars, but fatal "thematic echo" in climax: protagonist articulates thesis verbatim ("I speak for the forgotten winds..."), triggering -0.6 penalty for prompt-like moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (scent/sound mapping) and rhythmic control shine, but elevated diction ("factually mystical," "transitional object") during fossil discovery violates POV modesty under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong opening rhythm falters near closure: paraphrase loops ("smooth and ancient... perfectly preserved") and template cadence ("spikes of fear... pools of resolve") dull immediacy. Artifacts avoid closure-beat severity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of climate fiction via sensory cartography; "quantum echoes" transforms transitional object trope. Avoids derivative pitfalls through molecular preservation logic, though "voice of unknown" motivation edges toward archetype.</comment>
