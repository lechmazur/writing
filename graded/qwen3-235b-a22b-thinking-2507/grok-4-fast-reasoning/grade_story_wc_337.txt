<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("jealous of his freedom") and embodied emotion ("hands trembled") deepen motivation, but brother's spirit lacks tangible pressure; micro-choices during unraveling reveal values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: secret-sharing forecloses grief's path with felt cost ("peace as lucid as starlit prisms"), under Accumulative/Textural lens where unraveling knots reweights silence's meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary constrains choice (light refraction guides mask-reformation) and charges final image; tool (needle) evolution—from inherited object to dimmed instrument—directly shapes redemption's cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: each unraveled knot releases hush that accumulates pressure, narrowing options until confession's cost ("jealous of his freedom") crystallizes her stance with conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image reweights "lucid unrest" into earned peace without moralizing; theme emerges from net unraveling as metaphor for confronting regret, avoiding abstraction through concrete ritual actions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("salt-stiffened fibers," "prismatic halos") filters all description through restorer's tactile expertise; rhythmic control intensifies during unraveling beats with purposeful compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; high density ("interlaced hush thickened, accumulating silence like fog") propels momentum, though "lucid unrest" repetition risks slight overwriting in mid-beats without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms grief ritual trope through specific mask-restoration logic; "interlaced hush" as physical silence-accumulator feels fresh, though prism sanctuary leans slightly on familiar ethereal settings.</comment>
