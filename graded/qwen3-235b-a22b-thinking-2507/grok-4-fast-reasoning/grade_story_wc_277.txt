<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses (family legacy vs truth-seeking) drive her intervention; Quill's underdeveloped embezzlement motive weakens secondary pressure despite visible cost in his exposure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: pen's constellations disprove forged orbits with conceptual cost (Quill's hoax exposed), under a tight causal lens where Elara's logic forces the reversal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting (rosewood pen) constrains the climax—its constellations charge the final image; observatory's thin air subtly mirrors emotional exposure but lacks tactile integration during confrontation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's agency as she dismantles Quill's theory; cost is legible in his unraveling, though the embezzlement reveal lacks prior causal groundwork for full escalation depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</comment><comment>"Orbits of regret" evolves from metaphor to disproven construct, offering resonant non-literal closure; avoids moralizing but the final line risks slight thematic echo with "truths unveiled."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "broad-sheet sharp" voice, ink metaphors) sustains voice under pressure; minor register drift in "proof by contradiction" terminology slightly disrupts Elara's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold; "air thinned to a hush" exemplifies purposeful lyricism, but "playful symphony" in high-tension beat risks overwriting and dilutes immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of journalistic legacy with cosmic metaphor; transforms "orbits of regret" trope through specific pen-carved constellations, though embezzlement feels like safety-hedging for Quill's motives.</comment>
