<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "quietly deliberate" repeats as tic without emotional depth. Final endurance (bearing the key) lacks visible cost escalation beyond intellectual triumph.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with cadence shift as orrery activates; Charged Poise closure crystallizes options but conceptual cost ("means to close its greatest loop") feels abstract rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Nocturnal observatory constrains choices via crystal dome amplifying whispers and orrery mechanics; "iridescent crystal" charging final image elevates to 9-band threshold though micro-setting dominance barely clears gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("restore what spoons bent") without personal consequence; escalation through loop-closing deepens knowledge but lacks tangible cost on tactics beyond intellectual effort, missing high-band pressure requirement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</comment><comment>Theme emerges through shadow mechanics rather than moralizing, but "vital sanctuary" realization edges toward thematic echo; final image reweights shadows' purpose without stating moral yet lacks layered ambiguity for 9.0.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "fingers tracing faded inscriptions" and rune-focused noticing; rhythmic control falters in overwrought phrases like "ethereal winds wheeled in deliberate patterns," diluting pressure during key activation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with "brass filigree etched with interlocking gears" but figurative muddle in "shadows fled as if pursued by sun's unrelenting gaze" risks abstraction; minor scaffold in "quietly deliberate" repetitions limits 9.0 eligibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clockwork cosmology and shadow physics feels inevitable, though "spoons bend reality" premise risks quirkiness without deeper transformation; specificity in rune-binding mechanics elevates beyond trope.</comment>
