<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses in key beats; "spiritually curious" trait remains label without visible tradeoffs until climax. Final renunciation earned but prior vulnerability conflict under-dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with felt cost in "never fully faced his isolation," but orientation test barely passed at 112 words. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds cleanly through stellar descent imagery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tracking station functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (projectors for empathy), but nebula/hull details feel ornamental. Final image charges closure via lantern glass against viewport.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias's confrontation with isolation; "mended others' messes" crystallizes cost. Agency-driven deepening when lantern glass forces stance shift on vulnerability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through falling stars as vulnerability metaphors, but "flourishing stillness" risks abstraction. Final image reweights premise without moralizing, though "elegant silence" borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("primal grace," "elegant blades of forgotten light") modulates under pressure. Consistent first-person-limited lens with no head-hopping; rhythm varies naturally in climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong propulsion but "spiritually curious" phrase repeats verbatim (paragraphs 2/5), triggering synonym churn penalty. No closure artifacts, but scaffold weakens mid-story density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms cosmic janitor trope through specific vulnerability lens; "flourishing stillness" offers fresh inflection. Avoids safety middle via emotional complexity in isolation/endurance.</comment>
