<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority shines with concrete traits ("quiet precision," "persistently curious"), but Mira lacks depth beyond plot function. The "vulnerable voices" motivation lacks contradictory impulses—no internal friction between preservation and progress weakens the final choice's earned cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density ("damp velvet," "bruised purples") escalates to Charged Poise closure. However, the "vulnerable voices" cost remains conceptual—no tangible loss (e.g., Mira's sacrificed livelihood) makes the stakes feel visceral at the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium functions as active micro-setting: it softens physical edges while embodying the fragile echoes, directly constraining Elara's tactile discovery (condensation-fogged glass, coiled locket). Final image of pulsing hearing aid charges closure with environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes ("protect vulnerable voices") are clear but abstract; escalation lacks teeth as Mira's redevelopment threat feels distant until the climax. The hearing aid's pulse spike raises urgency, but no meaningful trade-off (e.g., Elara risking her own connection to the dead) narrows options with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>Theme emerges organically through "voices that endure" inscription and locket, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights the atrium as living archive without stating a moral, though "assures Mira of the voices' fragility" slightly over-explains the subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elara's caregiver lens filters details ("faded pamphlets on obsolete treatments," "rusted benches"). Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure ("pulses spiked, and a soft, disembodied murmur filled the hearing aid"), but Mira's dialogue lacks voice differentiation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Exceptional texture ("shadows clung like forgotten whispers") with minimal loops, though "reeling hush" repeats verbatim. Minor scaffold in "driven by an insatiable need to understand how the heart's rhythms persisted beyond the grave" slightly dilutes momentum before the inciting pulse.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "contact tracer for hearts" trope through tangible tools (hearing aid, locket) and emotional contagion stakes. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off, but the "unexplained vanishings" backstory feels derivative without deeper transformation.</comment>
