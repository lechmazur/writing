<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (anonymity vs. precision) drives micro-choices; embodied emotion in "faint indentations whispered of forgotten hands" shows character-particular perception. Final renunciation of abstract precision for soul's geometry earns closure with felt cost of enduring loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increase via coin-to-safe discovery deepens stakes. Closure as Charged Poise—demolition vibrations vs. completed mural—with conceptual cost (library's physical erasure vs. spiritual endurance) legible in "sky mirrored in wood". Orientation clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tree hollow constrains choice: bark grain guides safe discovery. Recurring coin's indentations charge final image ("tracing coin's indentations one last time"). Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—knothole "stars" ignored for tactile grooves during discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: coin discovery forces method shift from sky-mirroring to fractal portraiture. Visible cost in "first vibrations of demolition rumbled through the roots" as she completes work. Single deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image ("sky forever bloomed inside those walls") reweights "limits discovered" theme without moralizing. Theme emerges from concrete particulars: scars as "soul's geometry" reframes blindness as aperture. No thematic echo in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "fractally precise brushstrokes" and texture-focused POV replace visual clichés. Rhythmic control under pressure in discovery sequence ("grooves matched fractal-like whorls...revealing a concealed seam"). Zero head-hopping in single-POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fractally precise" avoids purple prose via concrete action ("render the subtle curve of a jaw's shadow"). Minor density in middle beat ("blending sky blues with subtle facial motifs") but no closure muddle. Final line recharges "hush" motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Face blindness transformed through fractal portraiture trope—scars as "unique maps" feels inevitable. Risk-taking (conceptual closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity: "centuries-old coin pressed by generations of secretive thumbs" avoids abstraction.</comment>
