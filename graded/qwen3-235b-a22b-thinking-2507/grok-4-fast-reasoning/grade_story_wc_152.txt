<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "disguised wisdom as foolishness" micro-choices, but "unheard stories" motivation lacks embodied conflict during pivotal synchronization; cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally shown under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens with cost in "wisdom masked in feigned clumsiness," but the felt cost of continued risk isn't dramatized sharply enough at the final beat to breach 8.8.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt observatory's micro-setting (embroidery hoop shadows, eternal candle flame) actively constrains choices and charges the final image; sensory details like "pop of the candle's eternal flame" embody urgency without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten effectively through synchronization, but "adjacent possibilities" method lacks causal teeth—it's intellectualized rather than tested through concrete failure/success, muting escalation's visceral impact during the conspiracy reveal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of "unheard stories as conscience" resonates through embroidered ciphers and candlelit revelations without moralizing, though the final line's "beacon for stories" risks slight thematic echo that caps near-band entry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("threads of silken starlight," "whispers no one else seemed to hear") modulates rhythm under pressure; zero head-hopping despite dense interiority, with elision taught through "echoed silence" motif.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves lyrical density with minimal scaffold, but "dancing quasars" and "errant stars" verge on mixed metaphor in high-stakes beats, slightly dulling closure's immediacy per Q7 artifact rules.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of embroidery as cosmic forensics transforms tropes; "adjacent possibilities" method feels inevitable in hindsight, though execution lacks the risk-taking (+0.2–0.5) needed for 9.2+.</comment>
