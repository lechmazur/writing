<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's embodied phobias ("claustrophobia that clawed") and adaptive dexterity during decryption create visceral contradiction; Marcus remains thin as a villain despite functional pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly when Elara stands at dawn—vulnerability transformed into strength—with visible cost in her shattered/rebuilt identity; seashell speaker feels convenient but doesn't break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Library actively constrains choices: claustrophobia flares in shelf shadows, rusted chains bind Marcus, stars frame evidence; "sagging shelves" and "corroded iron" charge the final image without static cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Marcus appears—truth vs. silencing—driven by Elara's agency in decryption and outwitting; cost is her identity's destruction/reconstruction, though embezzlement exposure feels slightly over-earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action ("vulnerability, embraced, was power incarnate" avoids direct statement), but final line risks thematic echo; resonance lies in seashell's silence after betrayal's ashes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("stars mocking," "rusty links clanging like applause") with rhythmic compression under stress; no head-hopping, voice modulates from trembling certainty to resolve.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "Firmly adaptive, Elara had learned..." and em-dash overload in seashell description, but no closure artifacts; propulsion remains clean with concrete verbs ("knelt," "traced," "sidestepped").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stunt-double phobias as tactical assets transforms identity-theft trope; emotional specificity in "stunt-honed dexterity adapting to the puzzle" avoids generic vulnerability narratives.</comment>
