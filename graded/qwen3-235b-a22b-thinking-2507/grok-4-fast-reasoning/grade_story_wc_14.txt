<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but lacks contradictory impulses; motivation clear yet passive endurance overshadows active choice under pressure, weakening the Earned Stasis closure’s causal foundation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens, with "void below" crystallizing conceptual cost, though the descent’s stakes lack tangible escalation beyond sensory accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bonsai setting charges the final image ("gilded leaves promised a new dawn") and constrains Elias’s method via refracted light, but micro-setting pressure on choices remains underdeveloped despite lyrical specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation ("textures of different times"), yet escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening; the lamp’s hum intensifies knowledge but doesn’t narrow options under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "invented histories" as tactile preservation, with the final image reweighting erasure through "textured dawn" without moralizing, though ambiguity on rebirth’s feasibility slightly softens complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("gilded fingers tracing lines") shines, but stress-induced compression falters—fleeing the plague retains ornate cadence, missing a crucial opportunity for voice modulation under duress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold, yet "incandescent restraint" and "prismatic shards" edge into overwriting during high-pressure beats, slightly muddling momentum without harming closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bonsai archives and textual history feels inevitable, but the stationer’s passive role risks template familiarity; risk-taking in Accumulative structure elevates stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
