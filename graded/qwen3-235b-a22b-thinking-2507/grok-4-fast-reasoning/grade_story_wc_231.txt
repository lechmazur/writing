<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in Elias's isolation creed versus his drawn curiosity to transient souls; micro-choices like plucking the boutonnière earn his final pinning gesture with visible cost. Stray abstraction in "voids where joy should bloom" slightly undermines embodied specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Elias pinning the flower reconfigures isolation into shared witness with conceptual cost ("witnessed isolation felt shared now"). Orientation anchors by 120 words, but stranger's fate risks ambiguity under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Opal dock's mist functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (trailing Elias like a shroud) and charges final image; Edelweiss' brittleness directly shapes Elias's investigation tactics. Sensory specificity ("salt-stiffened hair," "rhythmic sigh of waves") avoids cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (decoding the gesture) deepens through Elias's memory-borrowing, narrowing options to acceptance. Agency is observational, not active, slightly weakening pressure escalation under Accumulative lens despite coherent cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image—Elias pinning the Edelweiss—resonantly answers "why isolation?" without moralizing, reweighting purity as shared burden. Theme emerges from brittle petals and "gaps in borrowed memories," avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "minnow-like eyes," "mist clinging like lover's regret" filter world through Elias's eccentric lens. Rhythmic control tightens during memory sequences ("scents of pine faded into brine"), no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; "softly persistent" repetition in Q9D causes minor scaffold. Figurative language ("bruised indigo sky") serves pressure without muddle, though "shroud" metaphor slightly strains in final beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-borrowing trope through coastal isolation; specific Edelweiss detail transforms generic loss motif. Emotional truth in "release" gesture avoids sentimentality, though lighthouse keeper archetype risks familiarity.</comment>
