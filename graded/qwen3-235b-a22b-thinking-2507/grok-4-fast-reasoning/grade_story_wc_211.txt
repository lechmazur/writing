<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to archive emotional patterns is concrete through childhood memory and present action; his contradiction—binding others' feelings while hoarding his own—peaks in the chest-pressing micro-choice with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speech, only embodied realization: "loneliness of a scribe who bound others' feelings yet hoarded none."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: his quiet acceptance forecloses guarded isolation with felt cost. Orientation is immediate (rooftop orchard, foghorn silence), and Accumulative lens holds as sap immersion triggers prophecy. Minor deduction: foghorn's silence lacks full causal integration into the cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orchard micro-setting constrains choice—sap-infused rainwater enables prophecy—and charges closure ("apples glowing like embers"). Skyscraper context remains underutilized beyond "escaping sprawl," missing deeper urban pressure on the garden's fragility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (archiving emotional patterns vs. personal isolation) tightens via prophecy's revelation, forcing acceptance with undeniable cost: "his life's archive was incomplete without this accidental revelation." Elias's agency drives every escalation, from childhood theft to sap immersion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: pressing shaving to chest reweights "emotional patterns" as requiring vulnerability, not just archival. Avoids moralizing; prophecy's "hearts unraveling" mirrors his hoarded sorrow. Slight abstraction in "fracturing like foghorn's final note" lacks full closure integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("velvet disquiet," "robes trailing like forgotten promises") modulates under pressure. Rhythm shifts from lyrical ("whispering secrets to starlit skyline") to staccato during prophecy. Only flaw: "heart a drum" borders cliché but saved by context.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "loamy breath" and "genie's wish" show textural specificity. Propulsion accelerates during immersion ("soft hiss rose, like parchment unrolling in reverse"). Minor deduction for "gnarled apple trees" generic descriptor, though context redeems it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: oath scribe archiving emotional patterns via phonograph shavings elevates tropes through concrete mechanics. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off—prophecy emerges from sap/wax alchemy, not exposition. Avoids sentimentality via archival precision.</comment>
