<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "stoic wonder" tempered by resolve; micro-choices like sextant-as-gauge reveal hierarchy of values. But "equations for hope" motivation edges toward abstract telling without sufficient embodied struggle in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: terminal's reborn lights crystallize options with felt cost of solitude. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds perfectly as density of sensory details reweights decay into possibility. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Terminal setting constrains choices—vent alignments, confetti-obscured sextant—and charges final image. Sensory details reflect urgency: calm-moment star charts vs. crisis-tunnel debris. Recurring sextant piece qualifies as micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: sextant redirects flows, risking collapse in lounge. Cost is legible in "reluctant farewells" confetti and solitary satisfaction. One deepening suffices for length, though secondary stake (carnival aftermath) lacks integration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "equations for hope" becomes rerouted vents. Final image reweights "graveyard of dreams" into voyages yet to come without stating morals. Near-penalty for "wove despair into tentative optimism" bordering thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: engineer’s eye notices "alignment marks," "pressure differentials." Rhythm modulates from hesitant probe to revived hum. No head-hopping; elision of carnival’s departure taught early via confetti.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; high density ("dust motes like a hesitant probe"). "Reluctant farewells" risks sentimentality but saved by concrete confetti anchor. Final line’s "steady compass" avoids cliché through prior navigation motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: civil engineering as hope-crafting via fluid dynamics. Avoids genre tropes by grounding "interstellar dreams" in derelict vents. Specificity of sextant’s brass arc etched with obsolete stars transforms decay into charged possibility.</comment>
