<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority rich but "preemptively nostalgic" label repeats like diagnostic speak, risking over-tidiness; embodied contradictions in shadow measurements earn high marks despite minor abstraction in identity-sculpting motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly when Elara solidifies identity amid shortening shadows, with felt cost in preemptive mourning; Accumulative lens holds through shadow-length escalation but orientation test waiver slightly weakens causal anchoring.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—rain-slicked stones and refracting monuments directly charge the final image of "identity etched indelibly from stone," satisfying 9+ gate via environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist's shadow measurements narrowing options (fraying memory = identity loss), with visible cost in preemptive grief; escalation lacks one tangible price paid mid-scene to reach higher bands despite strong conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through shadow-length conjectures reweighting "collective memory" as fragile crystal, avoiding moralizing; final image offers resonant non-literal answer but "sculpt identity" phrasing flirts with thematic echo in motivation section.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "quill-point eyes" and crystal whispers; rhythmic control under storm pressure exceptional, though minor register drift in "conjectured wildly yet methodically" slightly disrupts voice consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Near-zero loops with high density ("lightning etched fleeting maps"), but "preemptively nostalgic" repetition creates synonym churn; figurative language serves pressure except where "raw clay of lived moments" risks purple prose in high-stakes beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of archivist-as-sculptor with storm-bound memory erosion feels inevitable; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though Cloudweaver lore edges toward derivative worldbuilding tropes.</comment>
