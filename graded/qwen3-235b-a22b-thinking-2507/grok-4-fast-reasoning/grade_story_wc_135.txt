<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority shines via embodied perception ("curl of spray against her skin") but harbor folk remain reactive props; their wariness lacks testing in pivotal moment where Elara heartens them, weakening earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as trumpet's hum ripples "unspoken yearnings" with rain-beaded stones reflecting cost, but "tentative laughter" lacks visceral specificity to make cost unmistakable on final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivory harbor’s rain-slicked stones bead the "rain's memory" during climax, charging the final image with tactile cost; leviathan-bone setting actively constrains restoration work through fragmented, eroded materials.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Elara navigates the valve's absence to reveal exile's forging, but harbor folk’s wariness resolves too cleanly—no visible resistance during climax undermines felt cost of rekindling trust.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Exile was not mere loss, but a forging" emerges from concrete fragments (log page, tooth oath), avoiding moralizing; final hum reweights "navigated absences" as paths forward without stating theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in "reactively visionary" lens ("glint caught her eye... visions seized her"), with syntax compressing under pressure ("spray misted... vision seized her") while avoiding head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; "tarnished brass relic half-buried" shows textural specificity, but "mosaic of half-remembered dreams" slightly overwrites in high-pressure beat without pattern-teaching payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "navigated absences" as active process (not metaphor) via tangible fragments; risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off through resonant valve payoff without gimmickry.</comment>
