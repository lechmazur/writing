<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Interiority relies on diagnostic labels like "steady curiosity" without embodied contradiction; activation choice lacks earned causality from prior struggle. No contradictory impulses shown in pivotal transliteration beat, reducing emotional complexity. Strength lies in clear motivation but undercut by unearned epiphanies about mechanical yearning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with bell's unheard resonance, but conceptual cost ("mocking the silence") remains abstract rather than pinpointed. Accumulative lens holds strongly through algorithm's evolution, yet cost proof test fails—no exact image concretizes the price paid. Orientation anchors flawlessly within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Acid sea and workshop described vividly but fail to constrain choices; no tactical impact from corrosive environment on transliteration process. Strength in sensory specificity ("bioluminescent fungi lamps"), yet final bell image isn't charged by setting—unheard promise floats free of atmospheric pressure. Micro-setting potential unrealized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (awakening mechanical sentience) signaled early and escalates through transliteration's deepening, driven by Elara's agency. But cost remains nebulous—"irreverent awe" lacks visceral weight, missing band guardrail for 8.8+ that requires price charging final image. Pressure coheres under accumulative lens yet feels emotionally unmoored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of mechanical yearning emerges organically through the algorithm's birth, avoiding moralizing. Final glider cart image reweights "unheard bell" into resonant answer about pioneering loneliness. Minor flaw: "ring a bell no one hears" borders thematic echo but escapes penalty via concrete execution. Earned subtext triumphs over abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("corrosive waves gnawed," "whispering brass") and rhythmic control under pressure shine. Minor filter-verb stacks ("she'd been piecing") dilute immediacy but stay voice-motivated. No head-hopping; kaleidoscope mechanics deepen focalization. Lyric compression taught early pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in high-pressure beat: "evolved into it... throughout the evolution... evolution of her work" triggers -0.2 scaffold penalty. Strong verbs ("thrums," "coalesced") offset minor synonym churn on "steady curiosity." Final image retains clarity despite lyrical density, avoiding closure-adjacent artifact penalties.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of steampunk and philosophical yearning avoids derivative tropes through concrete mechanics. Risk-taking with quiet closure (unheard bell) heightens stakes coherently. Transformation test passed—swap names/setting and emotional arc collapses. Specificity in "kaleidoscope transliteration" elevates beyond template.</comment>
