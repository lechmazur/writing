<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lira's dual allegiance manifests concretely in the juggler scene, but "orderly intuitive" remains labeled rather than embodied through micro-choices under peak pressure; cost of loyalty conflict lacks visceral specificity in climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with three-night escalation tightening community coordination, but privatization threat stays static external pressure without adaptive antagonism; closure's "desperate hope" lands with felt cost via the chip's return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The foundation stone chip functions as micro-setting—its weight grounds Lira during lantern-post scaling and charges the final image when returned to its niche, constraining choice while avoiding overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through graffiti's evolution from coordinates to defensive nets, but privatization patrols never adapt tactics to counter Lira's moves, making escalation feel predetermined rather than earned through protagonist-antagonist friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Dual allegiances" theme crystallizes organically in the phoenix mural without moralizing, though "desperate hope" abstracts the cost; final image reweights gentrification as navigable rather than erased, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical precision ("barnacle-crusted relic"), but under stress, prose fails to compress—"mapped her plan in quiet sketches" remains explanatory when syntax should fracture to mirror pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor synonym loops ("desperation laced... hope flickered") and rhythmic monotony in action sequences; avoids figurative muddle but loses propulsion during bartering rotations description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Raft-city gentrification resistance feels fresh through cultural mechanics (tide-readers vs fire-jugglers), though "foundation stone as talisman" trope slightly dampens risk; specificity in spiced kelp fritters and electric-blue vines elevates.</comment>
