<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's claustrophobia manifests physically ("clawed at her chest") and drives micro-choices (darting across trellis), but Thorne remains functional rather than dimensional; his obliviousness lacks specific pressure beyond thematic counterpoint.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis (hidden doll vs bunkers) with felt cost ("intangibly tangible burden"), but gravity inversion feels convenient rather than causally earned; the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density shifts during inversion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The porcelain doll functions as micro-setting that charges closure (warming surface, "intangibly tangible burden"); its fragility constrains Elara’s tasting method and reweights the final image against Thorne’s "enclosed worlds."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes (silence collection vs claustrophobia) deepen during inversion, but pressure lacks escalation; the gravity shift resolves tension rather than narrowing options, missing the "visible price" requirement for high-band entry despite thematic cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the doll’s evolving role—from "fragile fears" to "counterweight"—with the final line ("flavors of hush could forever sprout") reweighting silence as rebellion without moralizing; avoids thematic echo despite "stretch the silences" dialogue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in sensory specificity ("tasting of warm honey and aged gold"); rhythmic control tightens during inversion ("vines around her began to stir"), but Thorne’s voice lacks distinction from narrative voice in his sole line.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "gilded hush" metaphor risks overwriting ("opulent, with undertones of forgotten luxuries") yet avoids muddle through concrete taste verbs; final line’s "stolen hours" crystallizes momentum without dilution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence-as-flavor avoids trope through tactile execution, but gravity inversion borrows heavily from common speculative tropes; risk-taking (textural conflict) elevates stakes yet lacks transformative specificity for 9.0+.</comment>
