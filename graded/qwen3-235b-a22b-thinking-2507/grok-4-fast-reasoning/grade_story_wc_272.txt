<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in severing threads while haunted by memories, but "crestfallen spirit ached with luminescent glow" triggers diagnostic label penalty; embodied emotion strong in callused fingers working threads yet undermined by abstract phrasing like "hollowed by regret".</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "Elias emerged transformed" crystallizes stance with felt cost in "memories... each a thread he now severed," but reflection flattens pressure in paragraph 3; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density of sensory escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Forgotten library’s salt-crusted windows and splintered tarot box constrain choice (Elias pries box open amid closing walls), charging final image; micro-setting succeeds though "luminescent ache" repetition borders on white-room symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through rising tide’s murmur and deepening shadows narrowing options to thread-untangling, but "necessary darkness" motivation lacks visible trade-offs; cost is felt in severed memories yet agency feels passive during memory surges.</comment>
<question>5</question><question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Was reality truly shattered..." nearly triggers final-paragraph thematic echo penalty; theme emerges through tarot threads reassembled, but luminescent ache motif states rather than embodies the core question of fractured perception.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "salt-crusted windows" and "warped cards bleeding," yet uniform lyrical cadence dilutes stress under pressure; no head-hopping but rhythm flattens during memory surges where syntax should fracture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Luminescent glow... luminescent ache... glow of possibility" creates paraphrase loop in peak beats; high density in opening ("phantom footsteps... jagged pieces") lifts score, but metaphor repetition dulls closure’s final cord-binding image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tarot threads as psychological unraveling elevates trope, but lighthouse library setting feels derivative; risk-taking in Accumulative structure succeeds though "fractured reality" concept lacks non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>
