<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "confidently uncertain" and cloth-trembling micro-choice, but final shift toward resolve lacks sufficient struggle—grief's rawness dissipates too cleanly without enduring the void.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "quarry as archive" crystallizes stance with felt cost (cloth’s tactile promise against thigh), though backstory block slightly exceeds BRR ceiling without altering a present choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quarry functions as active micro-setting—Jack seeks its "tin-walled sanctuary" to appraise relics, directly altering his tactics; grille cloth’s scent constrains the final image, charging closure with "tactile promise."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose after loss) tightens through auction failure into quarry resolve, but cost remains abstract—Jack’s "softening longing" lacks visceral forfeiture beyond emotional recalibration, diluting escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: "purpose in quiet sifting" reweights "after the applause" without moralizing, yet "spotlight’s glare" line edges toward telling, narrowly avoiding Thematic Echo penalties in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("polyester blend from 1998") and rhythmic control ("valley-wide echo of yearning") persist under grief’s pressure; zero head-hopping, with compression taught early via auction humiliation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density ("hollow ache in his chest" mirroring quarry shadows), but "mechanical heartbeat echoing his pulse" strains metaphor logic, slightly dulling closure’s propulsion without artifact penalties.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of roadie grief with appraiser’s precision avoids trope—quarry as "archive" transforms loss into purpose—but "echo valley longing" leans on familiar musical metaphor without radical reinvention.</comment>
