<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied ("bare feet crunching shards") but lacks contradictory impulses; obsession drives action yet no visible struggle or tradeoffs weaken earned change. Flaws don't complicate choices—she succeeds unimpeded despite booklet fragility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: star's wink-out crystallizes cost ("plunging into true endless night") under Accumulative lens. Orientation strong early, but escalation lacks deepening—silences accumulate without narrowing options or raising stakes beyond atmospheric shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setting details ("shards mimicked pebbles," "gold leaf flaking like forgotten stars") are sensorially rich and POV-filtered, but fort/storm don't constrain choices—they're atmospheric backdrops, failing the 9+ gate for environmental pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping endless night) signaled early, but conflict lacks escalation: storm pauses conveniently, no antagonistic pressure tests her obsession. Cost remains conceptual (darkness) without visible tradeoff—fragile booklet threatens but never impedes her actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silences as map points reweight "endless night" from void to navigable space. Final image offers resonant answer without moralizing, but avoids complexity—no counter-argument to obsession limits thematic depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shards mimicking pebbles," silence as "breath of forgotten gods") and rhythmic control elevate tension. Minor register drift in "ambered hush" repetitions, but elision taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, but "ambered hush" synonym churn (4x) and "summarizing silence" template cadence in high-pressure beats trigger −0.4. Final image ("ambered hush settled") slightly redundant, dulling closure charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Summarizing silence" transforms mapping trope through tactile specificity, but "endless night" concept feels derivative. Risk-taking in structure elevates, yet safety-middle hedging—no moral ambiguity in obsession—caps originality.</comment>
