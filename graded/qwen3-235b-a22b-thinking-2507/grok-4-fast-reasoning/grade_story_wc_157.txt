<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; Elias's defiance remains unwavering without visible internal conflict. Micro-choices like the "counterfeit garden" quip reveal values but feel surface-level, failing the 9+ test for earned renunciation with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: drone departs but sirens signal encroaching danger, crystallizing options with conceptual cost ("chaos converged ever closer"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density increase in the warp sequence, though causality of the warp's success feels slightly predetermined.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Greenhouse setting constrains choices—bio-static interference from insects fools drones, and vines snag Elias like "grasping doubts." Final image of the gourd's rattle charging the earth elevates to 9-band by reweighting the dominant stake through a recurring object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation tightens under Accumulative lens as drone hum intensifies and sirens approach, narrowing Elias's options. But agency in the warp feels ritualistic rather than driven by active choice; cost (ongoing threat) is legible but lacks visceral weight in the pivotal beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "standing guard over one's spark" reweights through gardening metaphors without moralizing. Final line ("planting it in the wild, letting chaos converge to conceal it") delivers resonant, non-literal answer to central question, avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice has distinct perceptual signature ("thoughts taxable currency," "sly wink") and rhythmic control, but "candidly cryptic" repetition strains plausibility. Filter verbs like "seemed to whisper" slightly dilute immediacy during high-pressure drone approach.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose dazzles with textural density ("vines twisted like frantic thoughts") yet stumbles in climax: "hands steady amid rustling leaves that seemed to whisper" uses filter verb and mixed metaphor. Minor scaffold loops prevent 9+ despite strong propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of gardening as rebellion feels fresh (bio-cryptography via warped plants), but "rogue scholar" archetype lacks transformative depth. Emotional specificity in the hive metaphor elevates, though risk-taking stays within genre conventions.</comment>
