<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via embodied remorse ("heart pounding," clutching bead) and micro-choices (experimenting with elixirs). Final transcendence earned by causal chain from inherited bead to visions. Ghost bride’s lovingly venomous attribute drives irreversible tradeoffs without diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise RR lands cleanly: Elias’s fading body ("greenhouse lights dimmed to perpetual hush") crystallizes debt repayment with visceral cost. Accumulative lens holds through rhythmic cameo escalations narrowing options. Orientation solid by paragraph 1; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Greenhouse functions as micro-setting: ether-fruit juices glow "with unnatural fervor" during experiments, directly constraining Elias’s tactics. Final image ("love’s venom bloomed eternally" in transformed orchard) charges closure with environmental consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lifetimes’ debt repayment) tightens through Elias’s agency: bead experiments escalate to voluntary transcendence. Cost legible in body fading, but "debt" concept slightly abstract early on; one meaningful deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</comment>Emergent theme avoids moralizing: "love’s venom" motif charges final image without stating morals. Ending reweights "ashen-veil" symbolism into eternal bloom through concrete action (bead’s essence pulsing), not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct (alchemist’s sensory focus: "frost-kissed petals," "bubbling retorts"). Rhythmic control peaks during sleet scene ("ghosted into view," "bittersweet smile"). Minor register drift in "resonant awakenings" phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density but scaffold issues: "resonant awakenings" label repeats without fresh embodiment; slight rhythmic monotony in "winter-cracked fields" echoes. Final line ("spirits danced, elated in sorrow") overwrought but closure remains legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope via alchemical specificity (quince trees, ether-fruit). "Lovingly venomous" attribute synthesizes emotional truth with fresh stakes. Avoids safety middle by embracing morally ambiguous debt repayment without redemption.</comment>
