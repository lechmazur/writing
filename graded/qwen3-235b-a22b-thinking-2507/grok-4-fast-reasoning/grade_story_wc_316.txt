<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong (numbness vs. desire for feeling), but "emotions flooding back in a torrent" leans toward label-heavy abstraction during pivotal fusion, slightly diluting embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with corporations' claims dissolving and history stabilizing, but cost ("numbness crack") lacks concrete on-page specificity; felt cost isn't unmistakably anchored in image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Floating dojo’s levitating crystals and rift-shards provide vivid micro-setting, but environment fails to constrain choices (e.g., gravity-defying fluid doesn’t alter tactics); tool (blade) charges final image sufficiently for high band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via density shift as history rewrites intensify pressure, but "complementary opposites" method lacks visible trade-offs; agency drives deepening, yet cost remains conceptual rather than tactile.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through vivification ritual, but "balancing void with spark" phrasing risks thematic echo; final image reweights ego death through action, avoiding overt moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("emotional numbness" as protective void) persists under pressure; rhythmic control in climax ("nutrient fluid spilled in slow-motion arcs") avoids head-hopping despite archivists' presence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Emotions flooding back in a torrent" is tell-not-show scaffolding in peak beat; otherwise, high density and vivid verbs ("twitching faintly," "igniting like stars") propel momentum without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms clone trope via neural-echo specificity and rift-energy vivification; "complementary opposites" feels familiar but gains freshness through embodied yin/yang fusion mechanics.</comment>
