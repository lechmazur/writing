<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses during crisis; Elara’s flawless calm under pressure flattens interiority despite strong embodied choices like tracing wards. No visible struggle between vigilance and revolutionary risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "chains fell without a clang" crystallizes conceptual cost with undeniable pressure. Causal lens holds through blackout-triggered decoding to spark ignition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Quill holder functions as essential micro-setting (constrains decoding/descent), but twilight environment remains decorative; luminous fort’s rules don’t pressure choices beyond enabling blackout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single stake (ignite revolution) tightens via sundial decoding, but Dominion threat stays abstract; cost felt in "winking hush" tension lacks visceral Dominion confrontation in scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Silent revolution" theme emerges through concrete actions (no shouting, chains falling without clang), but "visions of a freer world" edges toward thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("keyhole slit eyes," "calmly inventive grace") shines, yet rhythmic control falters in opening’s overwrought "velvet darkness" description.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops, but opening’s "shimmered like captured starlight" overwrites high-pressure beat; minor density issue in blackout setup reduces propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Silent revolution via encoded sundial" synthesizes tropes freshly, yet luminous fort setting leans on familiar fantasy architecture without transformative specificity.</comment>
