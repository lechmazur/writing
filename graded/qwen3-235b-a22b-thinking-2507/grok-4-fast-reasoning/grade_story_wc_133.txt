<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias's solitude-seeking yet connection-craving; micro-choices like tracing rain trails reveal hierarchy of values. Mira's thinness slightly weakens relationship crucible despite efficient introduction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: brooch exchange crystallizes meaning-with-cost ("Elias finally slept... brush in hand"). Orientation clear by para 1; lens (Accumulative) holds through rain-trail pursuit to convergence. Minor rain-convenience quibble.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tidal island actively pressures choices (causeway isolation, salt scavenging) and charges final image ("rain trails now pooling"). Micro-setting (rain trails) constrains Elias's movement and guides the entire sequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (finding meaning in desolation) tightens through Elias's agency: futile tossing → trail pursuit → brooch exchange. Cost legible in insomnia breaking ("finally slept") and renewed purpose. No over-escalation needed for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from brooch exchange: "meaning emerged not in solitude" shown through action, not stated. Final painting image reweights desolation without moralizing. No thematic echo; ambiguity lingers in "fragile peace" insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fractured skies," "silver veins") with rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift in repeated "haggard awe" prevents 9.0. Dialogue carries subtext ("Unearthed convergence, you might call it") with voice distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Exceptional density but "haggard awe" repetition (4x) and "wryly earnest" echoes create subtle synonym churn. No closure-dulling artifacts; final image ("dreams alive with colors") avoids purple prose. Near-flawless propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms post-war tropes through specific, grounded details (amber brooch with insect, salt scavenging). Fresh angle on connection-as-survival; avoids safety middle with morally ambiguous elite hoarding water. One fresh inflection: convergence via object exchange.</comment>
