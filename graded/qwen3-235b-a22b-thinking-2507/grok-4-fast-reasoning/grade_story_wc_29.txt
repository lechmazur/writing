<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation ("fingers tracing faded lines") but "cautious hope fragile as starlight" edges toward label-speak without sufficient contradictory action. Micro-choices (sliding chart, initiating interference) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure with visible cost on Harlan.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Harlan's collapse and community's "wary clarity" reconfigure stakes with undeniable cost. Orientation anchored in first 40 words; causal lens holds through interference → signal warping → psychological consequences without soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration ("subsonic frequencies lurked below hearing") but micro-setting (console/charts) doesn't constrain choices—tools enable action without physical limitations affecting tactics. Final "honest silence" charged by prior static imagery yet lacks environmental constraint on closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by Elara's agency: Harlan's intrusion → her counter-frequency choice → tangible cost (his physical collapse, protesters faltering). Dominant stake (cosmic deception vs. human chaos) tightens through one meaningful pressure point with visible price on power dynamics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment><comment>Theme emerges through "cosmic tricksters" motif reweighted by final "honest silence"—no moralizing, just resonant image exposing stars' deceit. Avoids false equivalence; Harlan's ambition framed as human echo of cosmic games without redemption. Final line reconfigures premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("subsonic frequencies lurked") but minor filter-verb stacks ("Elara felt," "she knew") dull immediacy during high-pressure beats. Voice modulates effectively from "gritty symphony" to "honest silence" though register drifts slightly in stress moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Critical artifact in closure beat: "air thickening... like whispers grinding against rusty gears" mixes metaphors (whispers can't grind), dulling the pivotal image. Otherwise strong propulsion but this closure-adjacent flaw triggers -0.5 overwriting penalty per rubric.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "alien signal" trope through specific subsonic interference mechanics and morally ambiguous Harlan. Avoids safety middle with "wary clarity" resolution—fresh synthesis of cosmic horror and political drama grounded in astronomical charts' physicality.</comment>
