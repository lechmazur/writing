<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "foresight only in hindsight" motivation; final choice to walk into storm earns closure with visible cost of embracing lifelong burden. No second character limits relationship depth but single-POV execution is flawless.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "no longer a mystery but a purposeful stride" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost. Drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through dream-convergence beat. Orientation clear by 80 words with bunker/vines/storm anchors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vine-draped bunker functions as micro-setting: vines shift from "confining" to "allies" charging final image. Sensory grit ("damp earth/rusting metal") filters through Elara's urgency. Misses 9+ gate as body/tool doesn't constrain choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding path-choice) tightens via storm-converged dream vision. Cost legible in "ethereal grit of the world outside calling her forward" – acceptance of burden. Escalation lacks protagonist agency as vision resolves via external figure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "paths chose walkers to balance decay" without moralizing. Final image ("chosen and choosing in turn") reweights premise with conceptual cost. Avoids thematic echo despite figure's exposition by embedding in action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "vines as bindings of fate" shows character-particular noticing. Rhythmic control excels in dream sequence ("paths fork endlessly"). Minor register drift in "transcend illusion of control" phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; high density ("wafer seal... shimmering with iridescent veins"). Overwriting in "precisely playful shadows" (-0.3) but peak beats ("lightning cracked overhead") maintain clarity. Final image propulsion impeccable.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "foresight in hindsight" with path-choice cosmology. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off through Charged Poise closure. Avoids tropes via concrete stakes ("thorns instead of open meadows").</comment>
