<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (solitude vs. duty) drive pivotal blood ritual and lingering cost; embodied weariness fuels agency. Slight abstraction in "unspoken pleas" prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: "stubbornness lingered inadvertently—he remained... ensuring no signal escaped." Minor escalation dip in lens reformation slightly softens pressure arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Library’s impossible spaces actively constrain choices (bifurcated state enables revitalization); lens shards charge final image as "beacon for the rested." Micro-setting fully weaponized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias’s deepening engagement with lens shards, culminating in blood ritual’s irreversible cost. Single escalation point suffices but lacks a second pressure wave for 9.5+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through soul-inked tomes and recharged "chased stillness" motif; final line ("rest’s permanent address etched in currents") avoids moralizing while reweighting premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("skeletal fingers," "faulty beacons"); syntax modulates from contemplative to urgent. "Inadvertently stubborn" label slightly disrupts voice in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "prismatic glass shattered... like trapped stars" exemplifies textural density. "Inadvertently stubborn nature surfaced" slips into label-speak but recovers instantly with action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: undertaker/archivist bridging limbo via lighthouse lens. Risk-taking (impossible spaces) heightens stakes coherently; "souls inked into pages" avoids sentimental afterlife tropes.</comment>
