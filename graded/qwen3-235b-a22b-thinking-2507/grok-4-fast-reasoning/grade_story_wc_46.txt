<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority leans thematic ("pearl of stillness") over embodied contradiction; micro-choices during polishing reveal values but emotional progression lacks layered irrationality. Final renunciation of fire feels earned yet backstory integration remains summary-driven.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation test fails: "serpentine grotto" anchor arrives at 152 words, past 120-word threshold, applying -0.4 penalty. Closure as Earned Stasis (vow against fire) holds under Accumulative lens with conceptual cost, but disorientation isn't functional for closure payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mist and grotto create vivid atmosphere yet lack tactical constraint—navigation relies on generic "bioluminescent fungi" without spatial specificity. Micro-setting (sea glass) charges closure but environment fails 9+ gate of charging final image through concrete pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stake (sharing light sans fire) signaled early, but escalation lacks visible cost until climax; memory resurfacing deepens stakes texturally yet "weighing" action doesn't narrow options meaningfully mid-scene under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing; theme emerges through sea glass's prismatic reflections and fire trauma. Mother's dialogue ("light doesn't need to burn") borders on thematic echo but escapes penalty by occurring mid-story, not in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct "zephyr bloom" perceptual signature shines: syntax mirrors mist swirls ("bloomed like zephyrs awakening dormant flowers"). Minor register drift in "reflectively vibrant" but rhythmic control under pressure remains exceptional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative language, though "memories resurfaced" paraphrase loop (p.2, p.4) triggers -0.2. No closure-adjacent artifacts; polishing sequence avoids scaffold with concrete actions ("cloth softened by years of sea air").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Transforms "found object" trope through fire trauma specificity and grotto's serpentine constraint. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens emotional stakes yet "earthbound star watcher" feels familiar; synthesis lacks 9+ inevitability.</comment>
