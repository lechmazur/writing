<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction absent; Elias's "methodically hopeful" motivation lacks contradictory impulses during pivotal glyph-tracing moments, reducing earnedness of his peace despite vivid embodied details like "brush trembling as it traced another symbol."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise ("saffron quiet peace") under Accumulative lens, but cost proof falters: "insomnia yielding" is stated yet lacks visceral on-page legibility of the years-long struggle paid in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: the moon-tipped brush (tool) constrains every choice—from ink mixing to glyph-tracing—and charges the final image as its "moonstone tip still shimmered," directly shaping closure through tactile, lived-in use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative escalation excels through layered daydreams that deepen the "strangers remember kindness" stake, but protagonist agency remains passive; visions rouse Elias rather than his choices driving the deepening, weakening pressure under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from glyph-tracing and daydream vignettes, avoiding moralizing; the final whisper "strangers do remember" resonates as earned subtext, though "kindness circles back" risks near-prompt-like simplicity without sufficient friction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines via painterly lexicon ("saffron quiet," "neon haze blurred the stars") and rhythmic control during stress; no head-hopping, though "methodically hopeful" repetition slightly dilutes voice modulation in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Template cadence emerges in mid-story: "daydreams sparked to life... rousing Elias from his trance; his heart quickened" demonstrates paraphrase looping (-0.4), muddling momentum without touching closure but preventing 8.8+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lost languages as active invocation rather than theme elevates the premise; the brush’s moonstone mechanic transforms a trope into specific, causal pressure, though "smog-choked city" leans generic without deeper transformation.</comment>
