<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority vividly concrete (tears of 'bruised awe'), but motivation remains abstractly poetic; micro-choices lack tangible trade-offs beyond humming. Final endurance feels earned yet stakes insufficiently dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with cost (tears, extinguished lantern), lens holds as Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors by 112 words; slight vagueness in 'world unraveling' stakes weakens escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lighthouse setting charges closure: salt-crusted earth, lantern glow, and cliffs constrain choices. 'Pane of hush' refracts time through tangible cracks, making micro-setting indispensable to final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (calibrating doom's mercy) signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete test of 'world's unraveling' pressure. Tightening via humming succeeds, yet escalation lacks visceral narrowing of options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through 'beautifully flawed' fractures charging final image—no moralizing. But 'thousand lifetimes' abstraction risks sentimentality; earned resonance hinges on lullaby's tangible warmth in puppet head.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes through gear-humming, nested patterns, and salt-crusted earth. Voice modulates from 'bruised awe' to quiet resolve without slippage; 'feather-light touch' shows embodied specificity under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>'Bruised awe' repetition risks scaffold but evolves meaningfully. 'Feather-light touch' borders cliché; 'thousand upon thousand' strains rhythm. No closure-dulling artifacts, yet minor overwriting in 'primordial dawns to inexorable now'.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lighthouse/doomsday clock with 'pane of hush' transforms tropes. Emotional truth in flawed continuance avoids safety-middle, though 'world unraveling' lacks fresh inflection beyond established lyric mode.</comment>
