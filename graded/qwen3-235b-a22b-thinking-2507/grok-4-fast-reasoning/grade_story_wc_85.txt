<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s simultaneous urge to protect and confess, embodied through physical tremors and the watch hand micro-choice; however, Eliza’s absence flattens relationship stakes despite credible guilt-driven motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly—vowing to speak forecloses deception’s path with conceptual cost ("time stolen from Eliza") under Accumulative/Textural lens; minor orientation debt in temporal progression slightly softens escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Driftwood carvings function as indispensable micro-setting: the watch hand constrains Elias’s pivotal choice and charges the talismanic final image, with sensory details ("sieved hush," damp sand) purposefully filtered through his genealogist’s perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through Elias’s agency—sifting directly triggers the watch hand discovery that reweights truth’s cost; "time stolen" makes conceptual price unmistakable, though the single tightening lacks visceral escalation depth for 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from driftwood’s "discarded stories" to the watch hand’s final reprise, avoiding moralizing; the talisman offers resonant non-literal answer to truth’s weight, yet secondary abandonment theme slightly dilutes dominant focus.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "sieved hush" and carvings’ "crude faces," with rhythmic control tightening under stress; single-POV consistency anchors the lyrical compression, though "relentless tide" verges on bodily cliché.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "sky bleeding into the sea like ink in water" and closure’s "talisman of time reclaimed"; minor metaphor drift ("guilt gnawed... eroding foundations") prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of genealogist’s craft with driftwood archaeology transforms abandonment tropes; emotional specificity in "false memories could not erase carvings of the heart" avoids genericity, though risk-taking stops short of structural innovation.</comment>
