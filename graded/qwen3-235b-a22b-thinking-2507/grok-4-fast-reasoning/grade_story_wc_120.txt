<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "chronologically homesick" embodied through memory mapping micro-choices, not labels. Final conductor transformation earned by shell etching sequence with visible cost ("exhaustion's tide rising").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "become the conductor" crystallizes stance with felt cost ("eyelids grew heavy") under Accumulative lens. Orientation clear by 50 words; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Glass spire functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (muffled "upturned hush" forcing internal focus) and charges closure ("trembled faintly"). Environment actively shapes tactics, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Elias's agency—memory mapping deepens pressure as dawn approaches. Cost legible in "exhaustion's tide rising before first light," altering tactics by forcing final etching. Single meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "conduct tomorrow's silence" motif; final image reweights shell as "talisman" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo while offering non-literal answer to "unheard symphonies" question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("upturned hush," frost-etched walls) filters all description. Rhythmic control under pressure: "dough rose like unspoken promises" compresses diction without losing texture. Zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("chronologically homesick" repetition) avoids deduction. High density throughout; "blush of approaching dawn" crystallizes image without figurative muddle in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms fortune cookie trope via conductor metaphor—fresh synthesis where "symphonies of forgotten lives" feels inevitable. Risk-taking (chronological distortion) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
