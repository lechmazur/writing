<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority leans poetic over embodied; "furiously tranquil" remains labeled not lived. Final descent earns motivation, but contradictory impulses lack visceral manifestation during vigil pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: descent into storm with envelope embodies Earned Stasis ("refusal or endurance that forecloses a path"). Cost is legible in "scar of hope" as conceptual price of hope amid scars.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Observatory constrains every choice—timer pacing, envelope concealment in timetable, descent via trapdoor. Final image ("storm's glow lingered in his eyes") charges the micro-setting with thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (mapping scars through censorship) deepens via accumulation, not escalation. Cost is felt in "honed his voice, making it rarer," but lacks concrete tactical alteration from the pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Scars are the stars we navigate by" offers resonant CR without moralizing, but "wondrous guide to freedom" edges toward thematic echo in final paragraph, slightly diluting earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "lightning etched fleeting maps" filters storm through poet's cartography lens. Rhythm modulates from "furious tranquility" to urgent descent without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but "furiously tranquil" and "storm-kissed wonder" risk label-repetition. Minor scaffold in "sought to understand the cartography of scars" slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms censorship trope via concrete tools (timetable, timer) and altitude metaphor. "Scars as stars" reframing feels inevitable yet fresh, avoiding safety-middle abstraction.</comment>
