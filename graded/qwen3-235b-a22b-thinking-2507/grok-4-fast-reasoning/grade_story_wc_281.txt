<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theo's bootleg pill attempt lacks contradictory impulses during the light painting; his skepticism softens too cleanly without embodied struggle against longing. Elara's "willowglass hope" shows concrete interiority but Theo's micro-choices lack layered hypocrisy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with the developed print reweighting stakes ("swirls of blue for doubt, golds for affection"), but the cost ("The recall of the pill faded") feels slightly abstract—needs one more tactile beat showing Theo's active renunciation beyond passive relief.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The muscovite geode constrains choice by dictating light paths during painting and charges the closure image. However, the studio's "cooling fans" and "half-finished murals" remain atmospheric backdrop without affecting tactics, missing micro-setting pressure opportunities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when Elara proposes mapping somatic markers, narrowing options from pill dependency to embodied connection. But escalation relies on Elara's agency alone; Theo's passive "intrigued despite himself" weakens protagonist-driven pressure under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"This was better, grounded in flesh and flicker" articulates the theme explicitly in a high-pressure beat, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty. The geode's fractal patterns organically reweight connection, but the final whisper "No pills needed" states the moral instead of letting the image resonate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara's "willowglass" lexicon distinguishes her voice, but Theo's interiority flattens under stress ("Theo nodded, but his eyes lingered"). Critical somatic awareness beats use diagnostic phrasing ("neuroscientists called markers") that violates character-bound knowledge during crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"somatic awareness, those subtle bodily signals— a flutter... that neuroscientists called markers" contains a paraphrase loop and Wikipedia-voice. The final "profound—a map of the unseen" uses abstract tell where concrete show was demanded, dulling closure momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "telepathy quest" trope through somatic markers and fractal geode logic, but light painting studio setting feels familiar. Risk distinction for Accumulative structure paying off in Charged Poise, though "fractally precise" borders on technical jargon without sufficient grounding.</comment>
