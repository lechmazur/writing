<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("muffled clarity," "hidden assumptions") with diagnostic phrasing that risks Q1 penalties; embodied emotion surfaces in sweat-beaded brow and sandal's click but contradictions lack simultaneous tension during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Earned Stasis with visible cost (sweat, lingering weight of guardianship) under Accumulative/Textural lens; "blue-tinged fog" crystallizes reconfigured stakes, though causal linkage to Elias's rhetorical probing remains slightly oblique at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the palette's midnight blue constrains every action and charges the final image ("blue-tinged fog"), transforming from tool to thematic anchor; sensory details like the pedal's "click" evolve causally with the entity's dissipation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Elias's rhetorical devices narrowing options ("completion mere heartbeats away"), but the possession's defeat lacks visceral cost—dissipating into "echoes" feels conceptually neat without physical or relational consequence scaling to cosmic threat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "unraveled stillness" reweighted from threat to truth-space in final image; avoids moralizing but "core concept etched in his mind" edges toward thematic echo, slightly diluting earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("fractal patterns shifted under unseen lights"), though tense stutters ("had long served" vs. present-scene immediacy) and uniform lyrical cadence flatten pressure modulation during the entity's surge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose dazzles with "midnight blue spreading like veins" but suffers density penalties: adjacent lines restate "plumbed the entity's core... plumbed deeper," and "unraveled stillness" repetition risks scaffold despite thematic purpose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic ritual and cosmic defense feels inevitable; "loop pedal priest" transforms tropes through specific stakes (silence as weapon), with risk-taking (textural escalation) heightening coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
