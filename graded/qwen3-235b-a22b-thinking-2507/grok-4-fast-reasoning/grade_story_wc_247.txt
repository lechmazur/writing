<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias's interiority shows embodied contradiction (hollow camera mirroring hollow nights), but Lir remains a symbolic function rather than fully realized character, limiting relationship dynamics despite strong micro-choices during the humming climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "silence sings when we listen" crystallizes the Accumulative lens with palpable cost—Elias's mended fracture versus enduring forgottenness—anchored by the fishermen's silent wonder rippling across the harbor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The luminous harbor actively constrains choices (framing silences as musical notes), with moonlight/silence interplay charging the final image; however, sensory selection occasionally defaults to visual clichés ("silver paths") without sufficient tactile urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen organically as mapping silence escalates to public disruption, with Elias's hum narrowing options (isolation vs. connection); cost is felt but not visibly paid—mending his soul lacks concrete forfeiture, slightly weakening the trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (camera's emptiness becoming symphony vessel), avoiding moralizing; yet "joyful sorrow" borders on label despite resonant closure, with the final refrain slightly over-articulating the earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("luminous harbor by moonlight shimmered like a forgotten dream"), with rhythmic control modulating under pressure; sign language dialogue carries authentic subtext, though minor register drift occurs in Lir's poetic signing descriptions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lush with high density ("hollow vessel for capturing what eyes alone couldn't hold"), but scaffold appears in "tender shroud" abstraction and near-synonym churn ("fleeting hour"/"forgotten hour"), dulling two key beats without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sign language as musical notation feels inevitable, with risk-taking (silent climax) heightening stakes; yet the whispering advisor trope isn't fully transformed beyond archetype, slightly diluting originality despite strong emotional specificity.</comment>
