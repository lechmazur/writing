<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through empirically intuitive mind versus intuitive quest, with embodied choices like kneeling for ants. Near-miss on diagnostic label-speak with "empirically intuitive" but redeemed by concrete map-reading actions. Final choice earned through water-rising pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost—rising creek cresting the ledge as Elias steps through. Causal lens held flawlessly from ant trail to doorway activation. No orientation debt; anchors established within 50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Blooming cavern constrains every choice: bioluminescence guides navigation, rising water forces pace. Final image charged by "fading glow" reweighting opening's "uncharted void." Micro-setting (creek) alters tactics repeatedly with visceral stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single stake (fulfill promise) tightens meaningfully via creek's rise from lapping foundation to cresting ledge. Agency drives all choices; cost legible in water threatening chamber. Escalation pure protagonist-driven causality under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions—ant trail, matrix chip—not abstraction. Final image ("charting course toward connection") reweights "uncharted void" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by showing transformation via vision sequence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature as mapmaker: notices "subtle folds," "contours matching formations." Rhythm modulates perfectly with tension ("waters lapping... grew louder"). No head-hopping; compression taught early via estate sale mention.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "empirically intuitive" repetition slightly dulls peak beats but redeemed by concrete demonstrations. Zero loops otherwise; final line crystalline ("leaving solitude's shadows"). Propulsion flawless despite lyrical density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: antique trade meets psychological journey via matrix chip/ant trail. Tropes transformed through specific stakes (creek rise as live clock). Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens emotional truth without gimmickry.</comment>
