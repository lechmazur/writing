<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through micro-choices: her "heuristically gentle" gardening and bread ritual embody the tension between seeking absolution and accepting decay. No diagnostic label-speak; guilt manifests as physical crumbs on her lapel. Final endurance (knowing normality will reclaim it) earns cost through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: sprouts promise spring while she acknowledges normality’s inevitable return, with cost felt in "forgiveness as delicate as the thawing frost." Accumulative lens holds—the decaying courtyard’s gradual uncloaking tightens pressure. Orientation anchors ("crumbling facades," "frost nipping air") by paragraph one.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The tea house courtyard functions as micro-setting: revealed mosaic walls constrain planting choices, and sprouts charging the final image reweight winter’s hush. Sensory details (yeast scent, frost nipping) reflect urgency without checklist repetition. The earth itself charges closure as a recurring object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara’s agency: planting seeds uncloaks murals, shifting from passive noticing to active reclamation. Cost is legible in the fragility of her peace ("tenuous absolution," "delicate as thawing frost"). Pressure grows via density increase (revealed mosaics, sprouts) rather than reversal, fitting accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: bread offerings transform eating into "holy communion," and sprouts amid winter’s hush answer the sacred-in-ordinary question without moralizing. No thematic echo—final image reweights decay as persistent, not redemptive, avoiding false binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "colors leaching away like ink in rain" reflects her vigilance. Rhythmic control shifts from flowing descriptions to staccato actions ("She broke the bread"). Zero head-hopping; compression ("after the birds flew south") is taught early and paid off in closure’s temporal weight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "frost nipping the air" avoids cliché through concrete action. Final line’s rhythm ("holding her vigil against the fade") crystallizes closure without muddle. Minor overwriting risk in "crimson decay" but offset by purposeful density—every phrase advances atmosphere or character.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of guerrilla gardening as spiritual practice avoids tropes. "Heuristically gentle" reframes activism through intuition, not dogma. Risk-taking (accumulative structure) heightens stakes coherently, though "sacred in ordinary" borders on familiar—but specificity (Elm Street bakery bread) anchors it.</comment>
