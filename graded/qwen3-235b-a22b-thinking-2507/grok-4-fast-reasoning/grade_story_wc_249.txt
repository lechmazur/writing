<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in quiet rebellion vs auroral sorrow is embodied through drumming micro-choices, but "auroral sorrow" risks stock phrasing; cost of endurance in final drumming is credible though emotional progression lacks layered irrationality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Orientation debt past 120 words (no concrete time/place anchors) triggers -0.4 penalty; closure achieves Earned Stasis with legible cost in "fingers still drumming," but lens ambiguity weakens escalation under Accumulative/Textural framework.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sound wave garden constrains choice via drumming mechanics and charges closure through lagoon's liquid light, though bioluminescent vines occasionally verge on decorative; micro-setting of damp earth drumming at end fulfills 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Protagonist agency drives escalation (spire to lagoon journey) with visible cost in deepening sorrow, but "auroral sorrow" abstraction slightly obscures the felt price; dominant stake tightening via universe's hush satisfies band guardrails.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "quiet rebellion" motif evolving from personal act to guardianship, with final drumming offering resonant non-literal answer; avoids moralizing but secondary "shared ghost" imagery risks sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sound-focused noticing ("hush of universe inhaling") with rhythmic control under pressure; lyrical compression taught early, though "auroral sorrow" repetition creates minor tic in high-stakes beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Template cadence in movement sequences ("She began... She arrived... She remained") triggers -0.5 deduction; beautiful density but synonym churn in sorrow descriptions dulls closure's immediacy despite strong opening/final lines.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantum memory with sensory garden avoids derivative tropes through specific drumming mechanics; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes, though "quantum tether" phrasing slightly echoes existing sci-fi lexicons.</comment>
