<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("wild instinct and ancient tomes") grounds motivation, but "dimensionally homesick" label risks therapy-speak; embodied cost in "no longer merely waiting" saves closure from abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: passive waiting foreclosed with visible cost ("rose, her dimensionally homesick soul finding solace"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen garden constrains choice (waiting amid thorns) and charges closure (thawed perception, blooming roses). Micro-setting—frost-buried pendant—directly enables final action with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dimensional displacement) tightens through pendant discovery, narrowing options to acceptance. Cost ("interiorize exteriors") is felt in "mist seeped through her fur," though escalation lacks visceral pressure spike.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from "boundaries of light" motif reweighted at closure; avoids moralizing via "uncertainty now a trusted ally." Final image resonates without stating a moral, though "no enemy" edges toward exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("thorns etched crystalline patterns") modulates with tension. "Through the veil of sleep" repetition creates intentional rhythm, but "foggy lucidity" overuse risks template cadence in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops, but "dimensionally homesick" repetition and "patient resolve" weak modifiers slightly blunt momentum. Final image ("path back to her true archives") achieves clarity without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "library guardian" trope through feral embodiment and dimensional stakes. Fresh synthesis: "frozen thorns etching patterns on her mind’s hidden shelves" charges closure without gimmickry.</comment>
