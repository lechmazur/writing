<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority relies on diagnostic labels ("esoteric realist") rather than embodied contradiction; motivation lacks friction—no struggle between honoring histories and accepting impermanence during the gust's disruption. Final endurance feels unearned as micro-choices reveal no hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation fails past 120 words ("grotto perched above endless drift of clouds" obscures concrete anchors); closure (Charged Poise with structures standing) lacks unmistakable cost—conceptual loss of migration isn't legible through specific image, relying on abstract "honoring overlooked histories" statement instead.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Setting details are lush but ornamental; the grotto never constrains choice (reeds/silken threads function generically). Micro-setting fails—bioluminescent fungi and moth wing charge closure, but the environment itself doesn't alter tactics or supply decisive resources during the gust.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving vanishing history) remain abstractly felt rather than viscerally tested; escalation hinges on coincidental gust rather than protagonist-driven tightening. No visible price alters Elara's tactics—the unraveled lattice is repaired narratively, negating cost before closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through moth wing's reprise but final line ("wove truths from fragile wings") edges into thematic echo, nearly stating the moral. Avoids sentimentality yet conceptual cost (erasure of history) lacks the non-literal resonance required for Q5 9+ gate—closure leans explanatory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice has lyrical texture but elevated diction ("transiently rooted vigil") clashes with Elara's "realist" identity; repetitive "blushing stillness" creates template cadence in high-pressure beats. Perceptual signature is consistent yet overwrought, dulling immediacy with stacked modifiers during the gust's arrival.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose suffers from density overload—figurative language saturates high-pressure beats ("cadence, once harmonious progression... melody cut short" creates mixed metaphor). Paraphrase loops ("transiently rooted" x3) and filter-verb stacks ("she watched it settle") dull closure's impact, violating Q7 9+ requirements.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Esoteric realist" trope feels recycled without transformative detail; monarch migration + climate grief premise lacks fresh inflection. Emotional truth is specific yet derivative—no bold risk beyond conventional lyric structure, failing to synthesize elements into inevitable hindsight per Q8 9+ test.</comment>
