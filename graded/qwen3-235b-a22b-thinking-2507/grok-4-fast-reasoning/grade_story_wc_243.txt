<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via ink-stained actions; "haunted euphoria" label slightly edges toward diagnostic phrasing but redeemed by embodied tracing ritual on photo. Micro-choice to steep husks with seawater crystallizes motivation with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: plankton glow mirroring locket reconfigures covenant with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds throughout—twilight deepening to bioluminescence tightens pressure via sensory accumulation without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Jetty functions as micro-setting: jasmine scent triggers memory, bioluminescence charges climax, and "blooming void" imagery constrains Elara's physical stance. Walnut ink stains photo literally and thematically, charging the final commitment image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through proximate causes—ink blooming on photo narrows options to active regeneration. Cost visible when Elara trades reflection for action (steeping husks), altering tactics with physical commitment. Agency drives escalation under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: "weight of small moments" dramatized via photo-tracing ritual, not stated. Final image of withering blooms preserved in stories delivers non-literal answer—ephemerality made permanent through archiving—without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: archivist’s focus on textures (husks, creases, petals) modulates rhythm. Minor register drift in "bruised lavender" phrasing but voice remains consistent under pressure; lyric compression taught early via ink-blooming metaphor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion—"pricking stars," "unfurled petals" avoid cliché. Slight paraphrase loop in "context changed" repetitions but no closure-dulling artifacts. Strategic telling compresses backstory while maintaining causal chain for covenant discovery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: walnut-ink archivist transforms preservation trope through specific covenant mechanics. Jetty’s dual role as sanctuary/memory conduit avoids derivative settings. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
