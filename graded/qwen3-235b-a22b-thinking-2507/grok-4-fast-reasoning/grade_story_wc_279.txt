<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "discover meaning in the mess" drives concrete micro-choices: placing sand patterns for specific participants shows social perceptiveness as embodied action, not label. Contradictory whimsy vs. need for order crystallizes in the fragile "emergent hush" closure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: the mandala's "fragile" peace forecloses shouting with conceptual cost ("easily scattered by the next gust"). Orientation clear by 80 words; Accumulative lens holds through density of sensory patterns without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mist-moistened sand constrains Elara's medium choice (chalk dust must mingle with damp grains), while the grotto's acoustics directly enable the tile flake's function. Final image charges setting as "whispers finally hushed" reweights the opening "perpetual mist" with earned stillness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure tightens through accumulation: overlapping voices → mandala construction → synchronized breaths. Cost is unmistakable in "meaning... fragile, easily scattered," directly shaping Elara's final smile. Agency drives every escalation (prying tile, interjecting, guiding placements).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "meaning emerged not as clarity, but as... stillness" reweights the "fractured circle" motif without moralizing. Final image of hushed whispers offers resonant answer to "discover meaning in the mess" by transforming lilac unease into fragile peace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "chalk line on slate" cutting through babble and "hummed against her thigh like a conspirator." Rhythmic control under pressure evident in the mandala's creation sequence; no head-hopping despite multiple seekers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in opening ("whispering grotto shrouded in perpetual mist") slightly dulls momentum. No closure-dulling artifacts; strong propulsion in mandala sequence where "sifted it through fingers" shows concrete action over telling. Sentence variety supports scene urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "unlearning" concept with acoustic tile and sand mandala avoids art-heals clichés. Emotional specificity in "fractured circle symbolizing the unlearning's mess" transforms tropes through character-driven stakes and the cost of fragile meaning.</comment>
