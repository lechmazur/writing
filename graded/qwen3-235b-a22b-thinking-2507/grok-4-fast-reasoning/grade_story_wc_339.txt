<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through micro-choices like Elias's methodical wire untangling versus trembling hands; Mort's presence risks thematic convenience but gains credibility through the "rustle of autumn leaves" embodiment. Final realization avoids epiphany clichés by rooting release in tangible objects.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost in "flakes settling into stillness"—a crystallized moment where options reconfigure. Accumulative lens holds perfectly; each discovery (radio, note) deepens pressure without causal turns, paying off the "physics of letting go" premise through sensory accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sunken library constrains choice at every turn: coral-entangled fuselage forces navigation, sediment buries the radio, bioluminescent fish mirror thoughts. The snow globe's "internal blizzard" directly charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate requirement through environmental pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elias's agency: his shift from browsing to forensic examination of the radio narrows options toward the note's discovery. Cost is palpable in "sophisticated melancholy" as he pockets the wisdom—visible tradeoff between intellectual pursuit and reopened grief under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete action: untangling wires becomes "physics of release," snow globe flakes mirror emotional tempests. Final whisper ("release, not grasp") reweights the entire narrative without moralizing—earned resonance via the note's "sea's gentle pull" reframing Earhart's fate as liberation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: Elias's analytic lens shapes diction ("fibrous decay," "corrosion like onion skin"), compressing syntax during tension ("Elias's heart quickened"). No head-hopping; Mort's dialogue carries subtext without breaking POV consistency even at emotional peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts: "melancholy symphony of static" layers sound/emotion without muddle; paragraph rhythms vary to match pressure (longer for reflection, clipped for discovery). Final line's "half-remembered promise" recharges the snow globe motif with crystalline clarity—no loops or overwriting in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specificity: sunken library as "improbable library" of warped volumes grounds abstract grief in tactile decay. Risk-taking (personifying Death as "Mort") pays off via "autumn leaves" voice and causal role in closure, avoiding gimmickry through earned integration with the physics metaphor.</comment>
