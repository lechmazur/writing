<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("benevolently ruthless") is labeled but not embodied during pivotal gait alteration; micro-choice to append "sever" lacks visible internal tradeoff despite strong motivation setup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with undeniable cost ("pawns forever missing"), but interregnum timeframe remains atmospheric rather than tightening tactics; orientation anchors palace/gallery by word 10.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Whispering gallery acoustics actively constrain choices (amplifying incantation) and charge final image; chessboard's missing pawns drive closure's conceptual cost, though "luminous absence" recurs with diminishing returns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation via density increase (whispers intensifying to "chorus") reweights stakes effectively, but binding resistance lacks visceral cost during struggle—coiling "like flood currents" resolves too neatly with single gait adjustment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image ("pawns forever missing, a silent nod to gestures that unbound them") delivers non-literal thematic answer without moralizing; "benevolently ruthless" phrasing skirts thematic echo but avoids final-paragraph sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("nomadic penumbra," "luminous absence") filters all description with rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping, though "benevolently ruthless" diction slightly clashes with crisis-actor lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding loops but "luminous absence" (4x) and "benevolently ruthless" (2x) create minor synonym churn in final beats; "spelling hope across marble" exemplifies crystalline propulsion and closure charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crisis actor/survivor framing small-gesture historiography; chessboard with missing pawns transforms trope through specific causal role in closure, though interregnum concept lacks distinctive pressure.</comment>
