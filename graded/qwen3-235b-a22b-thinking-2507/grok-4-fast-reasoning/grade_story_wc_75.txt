<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara's simultaneous preservation drive and accidental acceleration of the melt; embodied dread ("rosewater on her tongue") avoids labels. Micro-choice of wedging the lens—rooted in her historical urgency—creates irreversible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: salvaged molds kneaded into loaves reconfigure loss as fragile revival, with corroded metal and meltwater conveying tangible cost. Accumulative lens holds—thaw progression tightens pressure through sensory accumulation, not causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grotto setting actively constrains choices: waterfall spray preserves bread rituals, humid air threatens ice tools, and the opera glass's verdant refraction charges the final image. Sensory details (cloying petals, slick ledges) filter through Elara's historical lens without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via textural escalation: wilting petals → droplets on ice → corroded metal flecks. But pressure lacks visceral tightening—Elara's climb feels inevitable rather than a hard-won choice against narrowing options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through bread initials and melting tools: revival isn't restoration but fragile adaptation. Final image of emerald-viewed loaves offers non-literal answer to "rescuing dying arts" without moralizing, reweighting preservation as active reinterpretation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in historian's gaze ("verdant vignettes," "preserved envy"). Syntax compresses under stress ("Heart pounding... waterfall's thunder urging her on") while maintaining voice consistency—no head-hopping despite crowd scenes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "dread bloomed like rosewater" risks cliché but earns texture through prior anchoring. Minor cadence stumble in "recoiled, but too late" slightly dulls the melt's urgency—a hairline slip preventing 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms refugee tropes through grotto specificity: bread initials as cultural DNA, opera glass as flawed preservation tool. Risk-taking (Accumulative lens for high-stakes action) heightens coherence—thaw as quiet crisis feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
