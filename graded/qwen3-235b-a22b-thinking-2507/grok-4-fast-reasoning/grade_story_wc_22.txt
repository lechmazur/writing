<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation burns "quiet and fierce" with embodied contradiction in cracking pods amid bloodied planks; micro-choices like murmuring incantations reveal hierarchy of values without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost—"fragile greens piercing the wood" crystallizes renewal's vulnerability; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through concord's stirring but cost proof lacks deeper felt sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Jetty's splintered wood constrains every choice (fertilizing salt-sterilized cracks); final sprouts charge closure by transforming "graveyard of ambitions" into "bridge to renewal" through prior particulars.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias' agency (interpreting birds to target barren cracks), but reef's death remains backstory weight rather than immediate pressure; cost legible yet not viscerally felt in peak beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concord's revival without moralizing; final sprouts offer resonant answer to "reclaim battlefield" by reweighting scars as bloom—no abstract statements, only "fragile greens" charged with cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "bruised purples" and "coral bones," but birds' ancient calls lack vocal differentiation under stress; rhythmic control flawless though all voices converge lyrically.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "volcanic soils" elixir and "bioluminescent pulses" show high density, but "whispering of resilience" slightly overwrites in high-pressure beat without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesis of ecological grief and linguistic archaeology feels inevitable; "narrow vastness" transforms jetty from graveyard to bridge with bold risk in Accumulative lens without gimmickry.</comment>
