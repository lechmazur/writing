<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's "shadow-laced" motivation manifests through embodied micro-choices ("rotated the crystal before successive mirrors"), avoiding diagnostic labels. Fishermen's griefs revealed via mirror visions feel earned, though "courageous anomaly" concept edges toward thematic echo in setup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "floes shifted one last time" crystallizes mended peace with felt cost (emotional labor in "heart pounding yet steady"). Accumulative lens holds—density peaks as mirror visions narrow options without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lighthouse orchard actively constrains choices: the drop to sea pressures Elara's mediation timing, while warped mirrors directly enable empathy breakthrough. Frost-kissed fruit and shifting floes charge the final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preventing violence) tightens through Elara's agency—crystal fragment's warming compels pause, then mirror visions force trade-offs (compromise over pride). Cost legible in her physical/emotional strain during reconstitution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through crystal reconstitution metaphor; "mapping empathy onto action" dramatized via shared-loss dialogue without moralizing. Final floe shift offers resonant, non-literal answer to "precarious balance" established in orchard imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elara's "calmly intuitive" POV filters details through peacekeeper urgency ("whispers on the wind"). Rhythmic control shifts from lyrical orchard descriptions to staccato tension during the "weighted breath" pause.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; high density in climax ("rotated the crystal before successive mirrors, each reflection mending a crack"). Figurative language ("branches heavy with frost-kissed fruit") avoids muddle while charging atmosphere under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms peacekeeper trope through ice-floe setting and crystal mechanics. Emotional specificity in fishermen's griefs avoids genericity, though "shadow-laced" risks stock phrasing. Risk-taking heightens stakes via mirror visions as empathy tool.</comment>
