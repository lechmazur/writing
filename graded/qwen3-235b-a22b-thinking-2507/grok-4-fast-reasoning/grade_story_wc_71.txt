<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and particular—his noticing of "creeping normality" manifests through embodied micro-choices (realigning photos, placing the toy) that reveal contradictory impulses (preserving memory vs. inviting renewal). No secondary characters limit relationship pressure, but his flaw (obsessive vigilance without action) compels the pivotal sanctification choice with felt cost: reversing societal hush requires personal vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orientation anchors firmly by line 20 (who: Elias, where: spring-swollen bay, when: dusk). Closure lands as Earned Stasis: his realization that houses feel alive through "lived imperfection" forecloses passive noticing with visible cost (the "hushed blaze" transforming vigilance into guardianship). Escalation under Accumulative/Textural lens succeeds via density increase (scent, light, object displacement), though one tightening would elevate tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The perfumer’s orris root shard functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image—its earthy perfume "infusing the room" enables the house’s "stir," directly shaping Elias’s method of displaced-object sanctification. Bay’s briny air and spring light aren’t backdrop but active pressure, narrowing his perception to immediacies (dust-laden curtains, scraping chairs) that mirror his internal shift from observation to action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reversing societal hush) is signaled early via Elias’s "quiet vigilance," with escalation driven by his agency: the orris shard discovery compels object displacement, narrowing options from passive noticing to active restoration. Cost is felt but under-dramatized—the "hushed blaze" transformation lacks visceral price (e.g., exhaustion, doubt)—though the final "inner light" reweights stakes by making renewal tangible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through displaced objects’ reharmonization, avoiding moralizing. The ending’s "hushed blaze of understanding" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to why houses feel alive: imperfection sanctified through action, not grand gestures. Final image (shard anchoring renewal) reweights prior material without stating a moral, embracing complexity via "lived imperfection" as both solution and inevitable human condition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice modulates with emotional intensity—lyrical cadence ("cherry blossoms whispered secrets") tightens during object displacement ("chairs scraping softly... like hesitant confessions"). Perceptual signature is character-specific (noticing "laughter faded to murmurs"), though "inadvertently profound" strains plausibility for Elias’s internal lexicon. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during the cottage’s "stir."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose excels in textural specificity ("powdery weight," "violet undertones mingling with briny air") with rhythmic variation, but minor register drift occurs: "inadvertently profound" and "sanctify" feel elevated for Elias’s voice. No loops or scaffold, yet one stock metaphor ("embers under ash") slightly dulls immediacy. Final line’s "hushed blaze" crystallizes closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms urban alienation tropes through Elias’s "creeping normality noticer" lens—specific details (orris root as "shard of hush," displaced toys as memory portals) ground universals. The risk of Accumulative/Textural structure pays off: object displacement feels inevitable in hindsight, charging stakes through tactile intimacy rather than crisis. Avoids safety middle via morally ambiguous cost (renewal requires embracing imperfection, not erasing loss).</comment>
