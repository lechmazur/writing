<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s duty versus guilt, embodied through trembling hands and micro-choices like following the ghost. Final confession earns visible cost with relic in hand, but the brother’s spectral appearance edges toward functional convenience for absolution, slightly undercutting earned causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative/Textural lens: bioluminescent inscriptions reweight penance with felt cost ("tides seemed gentler"). Orientation anchors instantly, yet the ghost’s emergence lacks full causal rooting in prior mechanics, preventing 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tidal obsidian ridge functions as active micro-setting—razor edges constrain movement, tide pools mirror his soul and charge the climax. Final image of dawn cresting the ridge with relic reweights prior guilt, satisfying the 9+ gate by constraining choice and charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (communal trust vs. hidden guilt) tightens through the vision’s pressure, forcing a trade-off: secrecy or confession. Cost is legible in Elias’s purposeful descent, but the ghost’s sudden appearance slightly softens agency-driven escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from inscriptions’ physicality—"bridges to forgiveness" avoids moralizing. Final image reweights "shared balance" from mechanical to communal without stated morals, achieving resonant non-literal closure through the relic’s tangible presence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters all detail through a clockmaker’s precision ("gears," "mechanism"); rhythm mirrors pendulum swings. Zero head-hopping, with stress compressing diction during the vision ("resumed its swing with a resonant thud"), though "searing reverie" repetition slightly dulls novelty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythmically to accelerate tension ("He was no longer in the tower"). Figurative language serves pressure ("tide pools mirrored his fractured soul"), but "searing reverie" repetition in peak beats prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms redemption tropes via clockmaker’s precision ethic and obsidian ridge’s physical logic. "Incremental absolution" through carved inscriptions feels inevitable, with risk-taking in climax occurring during pendulum’s pause heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
