<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interiority leans on poetic abstraction ("volcanic tenderness") without visceral embodiment; emotions labeled rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure (e.g., tears lack physical sensation).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost (tears claiming codex), but escalation lacks meaningful resistance—discoveries flow linearly without narrowing options or raising stakes under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting actively pressures choices: volcanic minerals scent guides attention, glyphs "hum" to navigate, and archive dust constrains decoding; environment charges final image through "volcanic tenderness" reprise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue promise) signaled early, but pressure remains abstract—no obstacle or cost during discovery sequence; tears at closure feel earned but lack prior struggle to deepen escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "volcanic tenderness" reweights destruction/preservation duality without moralizing; final vow to portray Lirael's story offers resonant non-literal answer to "soul of history" erosion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "callused fingers" trace tapestry, analytical mind decodes patterns; syntax modulates from lyrical intuition to clean action under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor artifact: "volcanic tenderness" repetition risks overwriting (4x), but rhythm varies purposefully; "soul of history" abstraction in para 1 slightly dulls closure charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: arsonist-as-archivist reframes destruction as preservation; "vandalized portrait as protection" transforms trope with emotional specificity that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
