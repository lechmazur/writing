<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation ("preserve wonder's color") but lacks contradictory impulses; final choice earned yet untested by genuine struggle or visible flaws complicating tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as valid Charged Poise (sprouting bridges with mother's restored spirit), but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—seed planting faces no concrete obstacles despite abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Waterfall-parapet micro-setting constrains choice (planting at stone edge) and charges final image; sensory details ("mist-kissed leaves," "velvet pouch") are purposeful and pressure-driven.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving wonder) clear early, but pressure never escalates beyond atmospheric deepening; villagers' arrival feels coincidental rather than protagonist-driven cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (fireflies, sapphire petals); final tapestry offers non-literal answer reweighting "color of wonder" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("secateurs-sharp eyes," "tendrils" of creativity) with rhythmic control; lyrical compression taught early ("hush of budding hope") and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor synonym churn ("budding hope" repetition) and near-label trait ("insatiably creative") slightly dull peak beats; otherwise high density and resonant final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pruning as world-weaving ("pruning away doubt to reveal vibrant core"); specific stakes (weary mother's renewal) avoid abstraction.</comment>
