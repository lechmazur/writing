<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Interiority strong through embodied calm ("sandstorm calm unbroken") and micro-choices (picking up locket, seeking stories), but final thematic echo ("listening had healed") overstates the emotional resolution, reducing complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with spilled letters symbolizing restored connection; cost legible in "tears fell as burdens lifted." Tomas' key revelation slightly strains causality as convenient coincidence rather than earned discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Courtyard functions as vital micro-setting: its "fragile peace" pressures choices when outside world intrudes, and the locket's cracked glass face directly constrains the climax. Final image of spilled envelopes charges closure through tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly through neighborhood stories deepening the mailbox's significance, but the resolution lacks felt cost—letters spill easily with instant reconciliation, missing a tangible price like unreadable decayed correspondence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the locket's note ("Listen, and let words flow free") and mailbox opening, but final paragraph's explicit moral ("listening had healed the fractures") states the thesis, undermining earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("keen eye sifting treasures," noticing "faint initials") shines under pressure; lyrical compression ("stories multiplied as dawn deepened") taught early. Minor register drift in "sandstorm calm" repetition slightly dilutes authenticity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("pried it open at last, the aged locket yielding"), but scaffolded calm motif ("calm anchor," "sandstorm calm") creates subtle paraphrase loop. Final line's "quiet power that follows where ears lead" slightly overwrites.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Transforms community-mending trope through specific mechanics (locket-as-key-container, storytelling as literal unlocking method), but core premise echoes small-town harmony templates without sufficient risk-taking in emotional stakes.</comment>
