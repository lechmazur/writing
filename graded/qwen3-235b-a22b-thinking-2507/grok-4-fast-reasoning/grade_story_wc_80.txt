<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "stoic facade cracked inwardly" during inkwell discovery; embodied micro-choice to embed notes reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost. Motivation slightly abstract but anchored by tactile repair work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with mortar-embedding cost, but meta-commentary ("wait, that's over—trimming back") fractures immersion at pivotal moment. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds yet artifact dulls closure image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Submerged pavilion functions as micro-setting constraining every action; bioluminescent algae and inkwell charge the final image. "Marble columns tilted like weary sentinels" exemplifies sensory specificity that mirrors internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake tightens through Elias's agency: mandated repairs evolve into embedding notes, narrowing options with felt cost in trembling hands. Single meaningful deepening suffices, perfectly calibrated to length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Interlaced absences" theme emerges through concrete acts (inkwell discovery, wax-sealed packets), avoiding moralizing. Final image of foundations guarding dreams offers resonant non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tide whispered secrets") with rhythmic control under pressure. Slight register drift in "stoically sensitive" label, but voice remains character-bound through lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor synonym churn ("crumbling foundations, a relic half-sunk" → "hushed blaze under moonlit ripples") in high-pressure beat. No closure artifacts, but "subdued roar" slightly muddles sensory hierarchy during climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surveyor/archeologist duality transforms "abandoned dreams" trope through concrete mortar-embedding ritual. Risk-taking elevates stakes without gimmickry; specificity anchors universals in pavilion's sediment.</comment>
