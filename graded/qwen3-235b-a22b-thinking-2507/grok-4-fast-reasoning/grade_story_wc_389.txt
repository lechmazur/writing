<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "lonely visionary" motivation is clear but micro-choices under pressure (e.g., palm on glass) lack causal weight. Final endurance feels unearned despite atmospheric depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: transformed world with conceptual cost ("shadows would ever truly rest"). Orientation anchors by line 15; Accumulative lens holds through lyrical density shift at shattered pane.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory constrains choices (radio tuning, portico threshold) and charges final image—cobalt glass shards refracting dawn. Sensory hierarchy masterfully narrows in tempest ("gritty rain lashing" vs. star-whispers).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shaping dawn via fragmented signals) lacks tangible escalation. Villages realigning off-page weakens cost legibility; "variant allegiance" remains thematic rather than tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through cobalt glass refracting light/shadows, but final "shadows would ever truly rest" veers toward thematic echo (-0.4 deduction). Avoids moralizing yet lacks resonant non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("static danced like fireflies," "thunder grumbled like a beast") sustains Accumulative lens. Voice modulates perfectly from disused murmur to "gritty, whimsical bark" without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("whimsy crept in... whimsical what-ifs") and label-heavy emotion ("loneliness a forge") dull two high-pressure beats. Otherwise, rhythmic control elevates "electric blue haze" climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Transforms "prophet" trope via radio static and cobalt glass physics; "gritty whimsy" tone avoids quirkiness. Derivative premise guardrail (-0.3) for familiar isolation-to-prophecy arc despite fresh sensory execution.</comment>
