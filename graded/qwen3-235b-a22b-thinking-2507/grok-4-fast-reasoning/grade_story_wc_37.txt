<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels ("fractured mosaic") without embodied contradiction; "scattered memory keeper" functions as diagnosis not demonstrated struggle. Final choice lacks earned causality—songs surface passively with no visible cost or micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation strong (mirror world anchors by para 1), but closure undermined by meta-instructions ("adjust narrative closure"). Cost remains conceptual ("memories aligning") not felt; lens ambiguity in final beats weakens Charged Poise effect despite vivid imagery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard described with lush specificity, yet environment never constrains choice—fruits crushed without altering tactics. Mica window charges final image but micro-setting fails; no tool/body/object shapes Elara's actions meaningfully during pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes clear (save realm), escalation via song sequence deepens light, but pressure lacks agency-driven narrowing—songs surface "from scattered mind" without trade-offs. Cost remains abstract; no visible price paid that alters tactics or forecloses paths under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through woven dawns as binding force; final image ("dawn promised eternity") reweights struggle non-literally without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo, though "swaddling in warmth" edges toward sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fireflies in gloom," "silken fire") with rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift in "rekindle" but no head-hopping; compression taught early pays off in climax. "Scattered memory keeper" label slightly undermines voice consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Opening line stellar, but mixed metaphor ("fractured mosaic... fireflies") and template cadence in song sequence ("one by one...") create loops. Final paragraph paraphrase ("binding and releasing... harmonious renewal") dulls closure image despite lyrical density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Transforms mirror-world trope via alchemical orchard and "swaddling light" concept; emotional truth in unraveling communities avoids safety-middle. "Memory keeper" leans stock, but bold "bound release" synthesis feels earned through specific stakes.</comment>
