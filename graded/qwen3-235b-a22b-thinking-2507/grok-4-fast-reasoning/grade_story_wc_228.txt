<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses; "intimately aloof" is stated but not tested through tradeoffs. Final choice feels earned via sensory pressure ("light shifted... beam would soon fade"), but interiority stays elegiac without deeper conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "I carry the quay eternal" crystallizes options with conceptual cost (fleeting sanctuary). Accumulative lens holds throughout, but orientation debt in cave geography ("unfamiliar shadows" without spatial anchors) slightly weakens escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Seashell functions as micro-setting constraining choice (must paint before light fades) and charges final image. Cave’s "sloped ground" and fading skylight pressure tactics, though quay nostalgia remains abstract rather than tactile.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when "light shifted" forces urgency, narrowing options to paint shell before sanctuary vanishes. Protagonist agency in choosing revelation ("murmuring the vow") creates visible cost—fleeting magic—under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of "temporary eternities" emerges through concrete particulars (fading light, painted shell), not abstraction. Final line reweights premise with "ache of temporary eternities glimpsed and lost," avoiding moralizing while charging closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("hues of aquamarine," "breath echoing like confessions") modulates under pressure. Minor register drift in "suspended the soul" slightly disrupts painter’s lexicon, but rhythmic control remains exemplary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "crystalline pool fed by underground spring" exemplifies textural specificity. One abstract phrase ("suspended the soul") in peak beat prevents 9.0, but propulsion ("stumbled into a concealed chamber") never falters.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms nostalgic artist trope via shell-painting climax. "Temporary eternity" concept feels fresh through tactile execution (iridescent shell, fading light), though quay setting leans generic. Risk-taking elevates stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
