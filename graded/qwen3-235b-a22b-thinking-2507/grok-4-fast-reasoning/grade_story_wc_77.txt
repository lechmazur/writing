<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction weak under pressure; "unbosom truth" confession uses diagnostic label-speak ("fear thrives on silence") triggering -0.5 penalty. Micro-choices lack character-specific degradation during electrocution aftermath.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure fails cost proof test: "fear dissolved" lacks legible price. Draft revisions ("Wait, that's over—recalibrate") expose causality breaks in the curse-rebound mechanism, undermining Accumulative/Textural lens coherence at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lingering luminance functions as micro-setting, constraining navigation choices and charging the final image. Overwritten "repulsive allure" descriptions occasionally stall momentum despite vivid sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early but escalation lacks protagonist agency; advisor drives key turns ("Touch it"). Paradoxical notes resolve fear too cleanly without visible cost, violating Band guardrail for 8.8+ requiring tangible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically until final paragraph's Thematic Echo: "fear thrives on silence" is prompt-like moralizing (-0.7 penalty). Prior concrete actions (confession in mirrors) show earned resonance, but explicit statement undermines subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "velvet over thorns" diction, but stress degradation absent during electrocution recovery. Advisor's voice lacks differentiation from Elara's internal texture under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Overwriting in peak beats: "moldy cotton candy sweetness mingled with rust and something sharper, like forgotten screams" stacks metaphors violating physical logic. No template cadence, but density issues dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Lingering luminance" transforms carnival trope with fresh specificity, but photographic curse resolution feels derivative. Emotional truth in childhood guilt avoids safety middle, though resolution lacks complexity.</comment>
