<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "void within him sparked at last" amid persistent hollow eyes, but quantum mechanics overshadows embodied emotion during pivotal charm scene, risking abstraction over visceral struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "cultivation was not conquest" crystallizes stance with felt cost in unchanged hollow eyes, under Accumulative/Textural lens where dune's glow spreading as "hope's infection" reweights the scorched earth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glowing dune functions as micro-setting that charges closure; phosphorescent lichen "brushing undercarriage like pleading fingers" during charm directly constrains Elias’s action and culminates in "petals brightened... cultivating life where none should thrive."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when Elias presses clock to crate—branching realities force choice between "dreamed of green" or "dunes swallowed trains"—but conceptual cost (unchanged dreamlessness) lacks visceral connection to the physical act of charm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "gentle unraveling, wave by wave" without moralizing; final image of clock as "fractured lullaby for the world remade" reweights the opening's "hush" with conceptual cost of enduring void while nurturing sparks.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful: equations murmured "through gritted teeth" and "voice rough from disuse" create rhythmic control under pressure; quantum jargon stays character-particular, never slipping into clinical abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>No closure artifacts, but minor scaffold in "dunes stretched ahead, blooming under the moon’s indifferent gaze, their glow a tonic" repeats "blooming" unnecessarily, slightly diluting momentum before charm sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms quantum tropes through "cultivating sparks" metaphor; chess clock’s frozen midnight as wave function anchor feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking heightening stakes without gimmickry ("Schrödinger’s lullaby, fractured and soft").</comment>
