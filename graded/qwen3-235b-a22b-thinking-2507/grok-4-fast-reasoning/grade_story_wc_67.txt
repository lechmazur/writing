<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elena’s embodied grief—porcelain edges as "fractured moonlight" mirror her "warm ache" versus raw loss. Flaws (fragile vessel metaphor) compound organically; micro-choice to powder charcoal embodies futile preservation without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: rocking chair’s halt crystallizes "safety’s illusion dissolved" with cost in "settled truths" ash. Accumulative lens holds—density builds via sensory escalation (humming motor → creak fading) to reweight "mirage of safety" through visceral stillness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Gallery’s converging lines constrain choice: optical illusions force viewer projection onto mask, charging final image. Body/tool specificity excels—charcoal-stained hands grinding ash into "forgotten regrets" filters perception through artistic labor without static cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elena’s agency: arranging porcelain shards reweights "mirage of safety" from abstract concept to tangible cost ("edges a reminder of incomplete information"). Single deepening suffices—motorized chair’s stop crystallizes the cost, though escalation lacks a visible trade-off beyond emotional toll.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through shattered vase → mask transformation: "fragile vessels shatter under unspoken pains" avoids moralizing until final line’s "somber marvel of what endures," triggering −0.6 for thematic echo. Resonance saved by embodied closure (ash settling as "settled truths").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives—"charcoal portrait ash scatterer" lexicon bleeds into rhythm ("soft rasp echoing in the hush"). No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during mask-donning. Tension in subtext: rocking chair’s "clever gear-driven trick" undercuts visitor "comfort."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Figurative density occasionally muddles ("powdered ash clung to her fingers like forgotten regrets" repeats "powder" motif redundantly). Minor scaffold in "she worked nearby, her motivation burning" but propulsion saved by visceral verbs ("grind," "shatter," "crystallized").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "charcoal portrait ash scatterer" profession transforms grief into tactile art. Bold risk in Accumulative structure—no causal turns, yet "fractured moonlight" resin reprises chair’s illusions to charge closure. Avoids abstraction via porcelain’s specific weight against skin.</comment>
