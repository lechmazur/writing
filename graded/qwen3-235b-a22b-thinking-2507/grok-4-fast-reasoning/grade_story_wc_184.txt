<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "heart quickened; this was no mere relic" versus "method remained warm," driving the merge choice. Motivation rooted in archivist identity avoids therapy-speak; cost is embodied via sweat but lacks deeper stakes escalation at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orientation anchors in 37 words ("university's adaptable archivist," "east wing," "witching hour"). Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: door flickers post-merge with visible cost (sweat, effort), causal lens held through gear synchronization resolving the anomaly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ceremonial rope constrains choice (reweaving braids) and charges the final image ("humming with integrated purpose"). Sensory details like "moonlight shafts" and "callused fingers" filter through archivist bias without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally when gears stutter upon her touch, narrowing options to the merge. Agency drives escalation, but cost remains physical (sweat) without deeper emotional or historical forfeiture scaling to "centuries preserved" scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through rope's transformation: "fables... served as guides rather than ghosts" reweights absence without moralizing. Final image answers "how do we anchor lost histories?" through concrete action, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in archivist lexicon ("catalog the chaos," "fragile cast"). Rhythm modulates under pressure (short sentences during merge), though "warmly methodical" repetition slightly dilutes distinctiveness in high-stakes beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion via strong verbs ("thrums," "unspooled," "exhaled"). Figurative language ("coiled like a serpent") serves momentum. Minor register drift in "resonant reconfiguration" phrasing, but closure image ("time ticked onward") remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival work as temporal defense. "Fables of absence" trope transformed through university-specific stakes (erased treaties), avoiding generic fantasy. Risk-taking in making absence the antagonist heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
