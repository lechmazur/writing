<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied doubt ("fingers trembled," "rag's weight a talisman") but "gravity of hopelessness" leans abstract; micro-choices during filtering earn endurance without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: the "Rise" mosaic crystallizes defiance with felt cost (trembling hands, onlookers' rediscovered wonder), but the Orientation Test waiver slightly weakens causality’s grip on escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The blooming fortress actively constrains choices—jasmine-scented air fuels the rag knot, fountain water mineral-tang enables hybrid fuel—making it indispensable to the climax’s charged final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elias’ agency (filtering kerosene, igniting fuses), but the "gravity of hopelessness" remains thematically potent yet physically underweighted until the crowd’s cheers manifest social cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glowing "Rise" mosaic resonates as a non-literal answer to despair without moralizing, though the fortress’s "breathing" metaphor edges toward overt symbolism in the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice modulates effectively under pressure ("chants grew louder," "meditative" filtering), but filter-verb stacks ("sensing the cool stone’s latent warmth") slightly dilute immediacy during high-stakes beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose shines in sensory specificity ("petal-soft vibrations," "mineral tang"), yet "playfully wrestling the void" risks purple prose, and repetitive "serious playfulness" phrasing creates subtle scaffold in the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of firework design with emotional alchemy feels fresh, but "Rise" as the mosaic note leans slightly generic, missing a truly non-obvious inflection in the payoff.</comment>
