<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (unravel sacred patterns to end precognition's torment) is rooted in consistent traits; her contradictory impulses (hollowing visions vs. ritual focus) manifest concretely during rock placement. Final choice to step into aurora earns closure through prior causality, though the curse's flaw doesn't actively complicate mid-ritual choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "Elara stepped toward the edge, elusive no more" crystallizes stance with visible cost (relinquishing shadow existence). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—density builds via mandala activation until futures "clarified, no longer chaotic." Orientation anchors who/where/when by sentence 3 without disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal bluff under aurora constrains choice: frictionless sea enables eel movement, aurora's "electromagnetic caress" activates star dust. Final image ("borrowed dawn yielding to true sunrise") charges the setting with thematic cost. Micro-setting (river rocks) directly shapes ritual tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elara's agency: rock placements deepen knowledge (visions shift from doubt to clarity), narrowing options toward reunion. Dominant stake (end precognition's torment) signaled immediately; cost ("joy pierced the curse's veil for the first time") is unmistakable. Single deepening suffices for Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "sacred patterns" shown via Fibonacci spiral, eel movements. Final image reweights "borrowed dawn" into "true sunrise of purpose" as resonant answer to understanding rhythms—no moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; "promise" shifts from sorrow to "eternal motion" through action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("veins of cosmic blood," "bioluminescent trails") with rhythmic control: short phrases during tension ("Tears blurred... but joy pierced"). Single-POV stable; lexicon stays within herder/mystic voice ("callused hands," "harnessed river"). No head-hopping; elision (mentor's past) taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with minor scaffold: "Visions flickered... But doubt crept in" slightly paraphrases internal conflict. Elevated diction ("ethereal light stolen") risks register drift but fits mystical context. Final lines avoid overwriting—"secrets etched in star-dusted stone" charges closure cleanly. No artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "eel herder" with electric eels/mathematical rituals transforms tropes. Frictionless world integral to ritual physics, not backdrop. "Borrowed dawn" tone avoids safety middle; emotional specificity in "joy pierced the curse's veil" elevates beyond surface novelty. Near-9.0 but lacks one bold risk distinction.</comment>
