<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her grasp of the carving blank—wanting to remember Marcus yet needing to contain chaos. Embodied emotion avoids labels; the hollow chest and tightened grip show grief's weight. Final choice to carve feels earned through crystallized memory harvests.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: spilled kettle snaps her back but peace lingers as she begins carving, foreclosing paralysis with visible cost (hollow chest, spilled water). Accumulative lens holds—each memory crystal deepens stakes without causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rust-hued light and ash wood constrain choice: the wood’s "resilience" directly shapes her carving resolve. Rain-beaded skylight isn’t backdrop—it triggers memory crystals and anchors the final "gentle rhythm," charging the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (containing grief) tightens through memory harvests, narrowing options to carving as the only path forward. Cost is felt in spilled kettle and "hollow chest," but escalation lacks one more pressure spike before the boil-over moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ash wood’s properties and "here and gone" motif—not stated but etched into the final carving act. No moralizing; the resonant answer lies in "etching peace into the wood," reweighting loss as active creation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: "rust-hued peace," "fleeting prism" reflect her tamer-widow lens. But Marcus’s dialogue ("Loss is the price...") slightly drifts into thematic echo, lacking character-specific roughness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion in "kettle began its low whistle, building steam" mirrors rising tension. One paraphrase slip: "rain pattered softly" echoes "rain beading" without advancing pressure, preventing 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lion tamer widowhood reframes grief as "harmony" not domination. Ash wood’s burn properties transform a trope into specific, causal logic. Risk in Accumulative structure pays off with closure’s earned stillness.</comment>
