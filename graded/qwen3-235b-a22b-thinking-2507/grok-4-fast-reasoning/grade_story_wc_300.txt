<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation shift from inspector to hope-crusader lacks causal groundwork; interiority remains abstract ("dissolve walls between hearts") without contradictory impulses during the pivotal hesitation beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (dissolving "entrenched isolation"), but the cost remains oblique; the "echo of connected hearts" feels unearned without prior concrete stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crystal caves function as micro-setting: quartz veins constrain choices (fissure navigation) and charge the final image ("threads of light weaving through the quartz"), fulfilling 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("apocalyptic shadows"); no tangible cost manifests during the pearl-crowning—pressure escalates through lyrical accumulation but lacks visceral narrowing of options or trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically through the pearl’s transformation, but "dissolve the walls between hearts" explicitly states the thesis, nearly triggering Thematic Echo penalty in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fractured rainbows," "sorrow bartered for survival") and rhythmic control under pressure; zero head-hopping despite lyrical compression teaching its pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Figurative density ("latent radiance," "sorrow bartered for survival") occasionally muddles causality in the climax; minor synonym loops ("resonant hush"/"shared radiance") dilute closure’s sharpness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of geological and emotional "crystallization" avoids tropes, but "cultivated pearl absorbing sorrows" leans on familiar magical realism; risk-taking elevates stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
