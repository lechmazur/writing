<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via embodied doubt ("edges of the fragment quivered") and micro-choice (banishing uncertainty with "love for the world's melody"), but flaw manifestation lacks lingering cost beyond the tethering beat, slightly undermining Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: "rust flaked away" reconfigures the covenant with visible cost (Elias's emotional labor during doubt), and causal linkage holds through the chip's quivering-to-steadying arc under solstice pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Resonance chamber constrains every choice—amplifying vibrations enable the tether—and the chip's micro-setting charges the climax ("light surged through the tether"), satisfying the 9+ gate through causal pressure on the orb.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias's agency: doubt threatens the tether (narrowing options), then truth redeems it, with cost legible in "visions flooded his mind" showing personal stakes, though rust's societal impact remains slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the chip's truth-sensitivity reweights the covenant's "unspoken dishonesties," and the dawn's "burst of wonder" offers a non-literal answer without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo entirely.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice modulates perfectly under pressure—technical ("tweezers forged from moonlight alloy") to lyrical ("chimes cascading like laughter")—with a distinct perceptual signature, though "veins of pure luminescence" borders on slight overwriting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythm to propel tension ("It didn't wilt; instead, it glowed"). Minor deduction for "wilts near dishonesty" lacking concrete demonstration beyond the chip's quiver during climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>"Covenant of rust" transforms decay into tangible stakes, and "mending what isn't torn" avoids trope via resonance mechanics. Emotional specificity in Elias's quiet victory feels fresh, with risk-taking heightening coherence.</comment>
