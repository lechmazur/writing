<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "kintsugi intentions" versus guilt-driven trembling; micro-choice of grinding aurum with gutter rainwater reveals character-specific value hierarchy under pressure. Final renunciation of frantic search for balanced wisdom earns closure with visible cost in the crucible's weight shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds perfectly: density intensifies through forge-heat escalation and name-inscription beats, culminating in Charged Poise closure where "weight now shared" crystallizes reconfigured stakes with embodied cost (tears/steam). Orientation anchors by line 30 without disorientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Foundry setting actively constrains choices—gutter rainwater for aurum, smoldering coke for heat—and charges the final image: "rain-washed stones gleam under moonlight" directly mirrors the mended crucible’s "healed scars," fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elarion’s agency: precise counterweights of salt/sulfur narrow options under mystical surge, forcing the trade-off where "heat threatened imbalance." Cost is unmistakable in "tears mingling with steam" during the mending, reweighting the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: kintsugi transforms from repair technique to "redemption not by erasure" philosophy, culminating in the non-literal answer "weight not as burden, but as guiding star" without moralizing. Luminous regret becomes active wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels—alchemist’s sensory hierarchy notices "volatile reagent" before emotions, with rhythmic control in "blue and steady" forge flames versus frantic search-party "will-o'-the-wisps." No head-hopping; compression taught early via lyrical shards.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; "luminous regret suffused the chamber" risks abstraction but is redeemed by immediate "ache in his chest" embodiment. Slight register drift in "ethereal potentials" is offset by concrete "gutter rainwater" usage in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes alchemy/kintsugi into non-obvious emotional calculus: "weight of names" avoids cliché through factual-mystical duality. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; the crucible’s golden veins feel inevitable.</comment>
