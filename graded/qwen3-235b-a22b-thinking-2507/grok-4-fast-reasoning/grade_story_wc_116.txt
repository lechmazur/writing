<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation ("witness change without judgment") is clear but remains abstract; embodied contradiction appears only late as "body aching but mind alight," failing to manifest earlier under pressure like library decay.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Earned Stasis under Accumulative lens: "peace endured, loosely held" crystallizes acceptance with conceptual cost ("mending weariness of untold drifts"), though causal linkage to swan’s discovery feels slightly under-earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choice: roots/fissures force burrowing action, and the origami swan (recurring object) charges closure by enabling the refuge; sensory details like "damp earth and decaying ink" filter through keeper’s decay-focused perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes ("crumbling peace") lack tangible escalation; library decay is observed but never actively resisted, weakening pressure until the swan’s discovery—too late to narrow options meaningfully within the short form’s scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "regenerative silence" reweighting decay as surrender; avoids moralizing but final line’s "profoundly real" slightly overstates the earned ambiguity of crumbling peace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ivory claiming pages yellowed by drift") shines; rhythmic control modulates with pressure (e.g., fragmented clauses during burrowing), though "regenerative silence" repeats with minimal variation in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "roots twisted through cracked stone like forgotten veins" slightly dulls immediacy; otherwise, high density ("burrowed into earth, tunneling past roots and relics") and clean syntax propel momentum without closure-impacting artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Synthesizes decay/regeneration tropes through specific obsidian refuge imagery; risks lyrical abstraction but avoids gimmickry—though the origami swan’s "cryptic folds" edge toward familiar magical realism without fresh transformation.</comment>
