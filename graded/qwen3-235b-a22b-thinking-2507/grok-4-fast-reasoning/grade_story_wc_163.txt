<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation for "rhythm of belonging" is embodied through coral-scanning and feather examination, avoiding abstract yearning. Her softly ingenious trait manifests in scanner adaptation and feather placement, but "abyssal roots" phrasing risks abstraction. Closure shows credible endurance with felt cost as quest becomes "seamless truth."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly: pressure tightens through feather discovery and Lir encounter. Closure lands as Charged Poise—"pulse synchronize, belonging no longer a quest"—with undeniable emotional cost. Minor fireflies convenience doesn't undermine the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting (coral spire mimicking Orion's belt) constrains the feather alignment choice and charges the final image. Bioluminescent veins as "hidden heartbeat" mirrors Elara's quest, avoiding overt symbolism. Pressure of silt-covered floors and anaerobic deep actively shapes discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's agency: scanner adaptation, feather placement against coral, and sharing motivation with Lir narrow options toward earned stasis. Cost is legible in the "seamless shadowseam truth" resolution, though fireflies moment slightly softens pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through feather-coral resonance and Lir's "digital soul adrift," avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "belonging" from quest to truth without abstraction. "Fireflies" illusion deepens complexity—illusion as earned wisdom—while rejecting simplistic binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("softly ingenious," "shadowseam wonder") persists under pressure. Rhythmic control shifts from "boots crunching silt" to "bubbles rising in unison." Minor "yearning for abyssal roots" abstraction disrupts lexical consistency mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density—"vine-like kelp weaving through control panels" does triple duty—but "fireflies of summer" strains physical logic in abyss. Final line’s "golden ripples" avoids overwriting; "seamless shadowseam truth" achieves textural precision without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of landscape astrologer with abyssal setting transforms tropes. "Shadowseam wonder" and anaerobic feather defy cliché through specific constraints. Risk-taking with accumulative structure heightens stakes—closure hinges on charged stillness, not action—without gimmickry.</comment>
