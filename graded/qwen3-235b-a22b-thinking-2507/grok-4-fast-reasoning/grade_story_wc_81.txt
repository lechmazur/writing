<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority grounded in archival work, but contradictory impulses lack simultaneous tension; "tranquilly perceptive" label repeats without embodied tradeoffs during critical stamp discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: conceptual cost of rewriting history is felt in "reclaimed stillness" shift, though "dappled resolve" phrasing slightly obscures cost visibility at peak hypothesis shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sensory details vividly anchor the sunken library, but the setting functions as backdrop rather than active constraint; ink stamp qualifies as micro-setting charging closure via authentication.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth-seeking) tightens via blackout pressure, but escalation lacks physical consequence; conceptual cost of rewritten history suffices yet feels detached from bodily stakes during pivotal readjustment beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through glyph/spiral motif reweighting; final image of "submerged truth" offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, avoiding abstraction through concrete archival struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dappled patterns," "logical indexing") modulates under pressure, though "tranquilly perceptive" repetition creates subtle voice convergence during blackout tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High-propulsion prose with minimal artifacts; minor synonym churn in "reclaimed stillness" iterations and one paraphrase loop ("dappled resolve hardened... patches of certainty") prevent 9.0 despite strong closure rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival quest within sunken city trope; emotional specificity in quiet resolve avoids cliché, though proximity to common "lost civilization" frameworks limits radical novelty.</comment>
