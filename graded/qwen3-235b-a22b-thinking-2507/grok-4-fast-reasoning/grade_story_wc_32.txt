<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (duty vs wonder) drives choices under pressure; "sensitivity pricked like needles of ice" embodies conflict without labels. Final renunciation of ecclesiastical path earns cost through iterative failures, though backstory depth slightly limits 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "stifling destiny fractured; the church's call faded" crystallizes reconfigured options. Accumulative lens holds via successive approximations, with "ember nexus behind him a testament" making conceptual cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ember nexus constrains every choice (e.g., "ethereal threads" enabling transformation) and charges the final image as "testament to beauty in breaking." Micro-setting detail ("vines of ethereal silver") evolves causally with the crozier's rebirth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation through iterative destruction ("shattered the shard, melted it") narrows options via Elias's agency, culminating in the "penny dropped" moment where cost ("frozen bloom of his soul thawing") reweights the dominant stake of interrupted destiny.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the crozier's transformation: "vivification wasn't in perfect restoration, but in the destruction's wake" reweights creative destruction without moralizing, with final image offering resonant closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frozen bloom," "ember nexus") persists under pressure; rhythm modulates from "whispering incantations" to brittle laughter. No head-hopping; syntax compresses during high-stakes attempts ("Nothing. The metal merely softened").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with "vines of ethereal silver unfurling" charging closure, but "frozen bloom" repetition across beats risks subtle scaffold. Final line avoids purple prose, though "thawing into vibrant possibility" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy trope via "successive approximation" method and crozier's transformation; avoids generic "rebirth" through specific ecclesiastical stakes. Risk-taking (accumulative structure) heightens coherence without gimmickry, though not quite revolutionary.</comment>
