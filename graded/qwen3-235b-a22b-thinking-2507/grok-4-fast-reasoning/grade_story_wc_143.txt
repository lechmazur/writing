<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("melancholy seeped," "heart ached") without concrete embodiment; "diagnostic label-speak" in peak beats triggers -0.4 penalty. Motivation is clear but emotional progression lacks contradictory physicality under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with felt cost (enduring cold for last hush), but "unstable ejecta" warning introduces irrelevant pressure that dilutes escalation. Orientation anchors land by 120 words; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Moonlit summit functions as essential micro-setting: regolith crunch constrains movement, vial glow guides timing, final descent charges closure. Environment directly alters tactics (camera placement, chemical method) with vivid sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving the hush) tightens through pre-dawn light and grain catalysis, but "unstable ejecta" warning adds extraneous pressure unconnected to core conflict. Endurance agency is clear with visible cost (fatigue, cold), yet escalation lacks one cohesive deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through grain→photograph progression without moralizing; final image ("whisper of the wild" in archives) reweights "progress" conceptually. Avoids thematic echo, though "natural poetry" borders on abstraction near closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct lunar lexicon ("regolith," "chem-lab") with rhythmic control, but "heart ached with dawnlit melancholy" slips into generic phrasing. Perceptual signature shines in professional details yet falters under peak stress with abstract emotion labels.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion ("frost-laced regolith," "hues of rose and ash") marred by paraphrase loops (melancholy x4) in final beats. No figurative muddle, but minor scaffold dilutes closure's emotional charge without harming causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of space age vs. natural solitude; hourglass grain device feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Bold risk-taking (melancholy as core tension) heightens stakes without obscurity, transforming sci-fi tropes through specific emotional truth.</comment>
