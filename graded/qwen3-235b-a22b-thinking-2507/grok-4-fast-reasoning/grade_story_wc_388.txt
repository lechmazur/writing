<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong motivation ("excavate truth from comfortable lies") drives action, but lacks visible internal conflict about shattering hope; closure choice feels earned yet under-stressed cost of destroying fragile myths during the pivotal pocketing moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly (diamond reweighted from "cursed" to "misunderstood brilliance"), but cost ("weight of her motivation realized") leans tell-y; orientation anchors within 120 words via "radioactive dust storms" and "liquidation" avoid penalties.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Radiation particles "clinging like desperate ghosts" and humming crystal charge final image; orchard setting actively constrains choices (scanner warnings, storm timing) while embodying thematic tension between truth and myth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (truth vs. comfortable lies) signaled early, but escalation lacks visible price narrowing options; storm gathering raises urgency yet doesn't alter Elara's tactics, missing the "trade-off" band guardrail for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from reassembled letters reframing "cursed" tech as salvation; final image ("seed of real redemption") avoids moralizing while charging the orchard's glow with conceptual cost of shattered illusions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sharply observant eyes" catching timeline gaps) persists under pressure; no head-hopping, though "intuition solidifying" near closure slightly violates POV lexicon with clinical abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density ("edges frayed and yellowed, as if torn in haste") with rhythmic propulsion, but "intuition solidifying" near climax triggers label-speak penalty; final line’s "unvarnished light" metaphor avoids cliché through concrete stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corporate dystopia and quantum agriculture tropes feels inevitable, yet "cursed diamond" reveal lacks transformative risk; specificity of AgriCorp memos and radiation-filtering tech elevates beyond genre templates.</comment>
