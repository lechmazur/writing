<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (rigid control vs needed vulnerability) drives the climax; embodied flaw ("iron grip") costs the guardianship. Lacks secondary character to test transformation, but single-POV baseline fully met with micro-choices like driftwood arrangement anchoring resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: canyon hush shifts from "oppressive" to "invitational" with undeniable cost ("iron grip" causing failure). Accumulative lens holds through sensory deepening; orientation anchored by 40 words. Minor deduction for slightly mannered "avalanchingly quiet" refrain diluting climax pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Thunder-echo Range actively constrains choice (driftwood markers for navigation) and charges closure ("thunder's distant memory fading into hush"). Canyon hush evolves from burial metaphor to invitational tone, directly reweighting stakes in final image—exceeds micro-setting gate for 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding failure) tightens through flute visions confronting her "shade of former self." Cost is visceral ("fractured resolve" made physical via driftwood), but escalation lacks external pressure spikes; internal deepening sufficient yet not maximally charged for high-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "yielding to the melody could mend tears" reweights weaving motif without moralizing. Final image ("weaving failures into strength of worlds entwined") offers non-literal answer, but "harvest insights" phrasing borders on thematic echo, narrowly avoiding penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct geological perceptual signature ("granite spires," "sun-bleached driftwood") modulates under pressure—short sentences during flute playing heighten immediacy. Deduction only for "avalanche of hush" metaphor slightly overwrought in climax beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with purposeful rhythm shifts, but "avalanchingly quiet" appears three times with diminishing returns in final third. Mixed metaphor ("silence buried footsteps like unseen avalanche") slightly muddles causality without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "failed guardian" trope via geological specificity and driftwood markers as embodied resolve. Emotional truth shines, but relic-keeper archetype lacks fresh inflection; "weaving" concept feels familiar despite strong execution.</comment>
