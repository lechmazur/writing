<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; "resiliently positive" trait is stated but not tested with visceral cost during vanishing. Grandfather lore feels retrofitted, weakening motivation causality despite strong embodied details like callused hands wiping sweat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis with conceptual cost ("enduring scar"), lens holds causally. But the radio solution lacks escalation—no failed attempts or rising difficulty narrows options meaningfully before the merge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Spectral grotto’s luminous patterns charge the final image via the hourglass reprise, but setting rarely constrains choices; Elias could navigate with any map. Strong sensory specificity ("jaws of jagged rock") anchors the transient realm without white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vanishing ferry) is clear, but escalation falters—the core problem resolves too smoothly via radio without meaningful tightening. The conceptual cost ("permanent whisper") charges the ending, yet pressure doesn’t intensify under protagonist agency after the hourglass discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the hourglass’s reprise and "permanent transient" duality; final image ("scar," "next voyage") offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite high-concept premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice shines with maritime texture ("groaning engines," "choppy waves") but fractures under stress: Elias’s crisis thoughts ("cosmic mishap," "deep-seated drive") read as over-articulated therapy-speak, violating POV plausibility during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Filter-verb stack in the climax ("mind raced... resolve anchored him; this was no nightmare") dulls immediacy, compounded by synonym churn ("luminous mist," "luminous webs"). Strong opening cadence degrades into mechanical rhythm during the radio sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of commuter realism and time-folding fantasy, but the hourglass mechanic feels tropey without unique transformation. Risk-taking (sideways clocks, grotto physics) heightens stakes yet lacks emotional specificity in the resolution’s "scar."</comment>
