<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority relies on metaphor over concrete embodiment; "buried talents" is diagnostic label-speak in peak beats without embodied cost. Contradictory impulses absent—Elowen pursues decoding relentlessly without tactical shifts or value hierarchies under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: visions stabilize "as bridge," integrating pain into purpose with felt cost ("painful remembrances softened"). Orientation clear by para 1; Accumulative lens holds through density escalation to the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setting pressures choices via the feather's texture constraining decoding method. "Labyrinthine shelves morphing into winding paths" charges closure, but generic "damp stone" details lack character-specific filtering beyond Elowen's mercury-glass lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes ("understand home's shape") remain abstract despite visceral pain; no specific cost tied to stone's use beyond emotional weight. Escalation lacks narrowing options—feather method works consistently without trade-offs or tactical shifts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "fractal of memory and myth" closure image, reweighting loss as eternal formation. Avoids moralizing; "thunder's rumble" as integrated cost charges the final resonance without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("mercury swirled in her glass-veined eyes") modulates under stress. But uniform tics—"thunder" motif—flatten texture shifts; lyrical compression in decoding scenes risks choreography clutter without payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Overwriting in closure beat: "shimmering with purpose" dulls final image. Paraphrase loops ("substituting reality... substituting reality") and mixed metaphor ("thunder grumbled distantly, hidden in mountain's belly") harm momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "buried talents" as subterranean storms, but "lost language stone" trope lacks transformation. Emotional specificity in "feather soft as forgotten sighs" elevates, though safety-middle hedging avoids bold structural risks.</comment>
