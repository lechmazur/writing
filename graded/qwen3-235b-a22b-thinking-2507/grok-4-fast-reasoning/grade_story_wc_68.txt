<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in cog dilemma (guardian vs grave-robber), but "rational rebellion" label triggers diagnostic penalty; micro-choices like etching manifestos show embodied motivation despite slight abstraction in climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully when Elias buries the cog—visible cost in "coated in city's abrasive calm" crystallizes refusal with conceptual weight; Accumulative lens holds flawlessly through sedimentary deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sewer functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (slime-slick pacing, digging in mud); bioluminescent algae's "ghostly veils" charge the final image by reweighting the chronometer's significance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through excavation beats as journal discovery forces agonizing choice; cost is visceral in "fingers black with mud," but escalation lacks one more narrowing of options before closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from cog's duality—final etching offers resonant answer without moralizing—but "rational rebellion" phrasing near climax risks thematic echo, slightly muddying earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in "brass whisper of precision" and fungal manifestos; voice modulates perfectly from reflective to decisive under pressure with zero head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft dazzles ("sunken spires layered in silt and memory"), but "rational rebellion burned cold" contains stock metaphor string that slightly muddles physical logic mid-escalation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms post-plague trope through sedimentary archaeology and "abrasive calm" tone; emotional specificity in preservation motivation feels fresh, avoiding derivative safety.</comment>
