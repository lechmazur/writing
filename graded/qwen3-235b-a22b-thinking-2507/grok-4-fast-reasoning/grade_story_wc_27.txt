<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation for "meaning in the mess" remains abstract despite embodied actions; no visible friction between hope and disillusionment during pivotal stone circle vision. Contradictory impulses ("awkward confidence") lack concrete trade-offs under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: humming with stones crystallizes rebellion's reconfiguration with felt cost ("awkward hitch in breath"). Lens shifts from situational (rebellion context) to accumulative (pattern recognition), but holds through closure's resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Abandoned spaceport repair bay functions as micro-setting: ferrocrete floor grounds Elara's bare feet during vibration, tarp-mottled opera glasses enable star observation, and stone circle's glyphs constrain her final choice. Final image charges "thunderous serenity" with tangible cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's agency (approaching circle, humming), but the vision's revelation feels externally granted rather than earned through struggle. Dominant stake (rebellion meaning) deepens credibly, though cost lacks specificity beyond emotional tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically through star patterns resolving "mess" into rebellion strategy, avoiding moralizing. Final line ("thunderous serenity now a promise of storms") offers resonant non-literal answer, though "meaning in the mess" phrasing risks abstraction without sufficient concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "bruised purples," "plasma exhaust" metaphors filtered through stargazer's lens. Rhythmic control intensifies during stone circle hum with purposeful compression ("images flooded her"). Zero head-hopping in single-POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Filter-verb stacks in opening ("was driven," "sought," "spotted") dull immediacy, triggering -0.5. Otherwise vivid propulsion: "rust mottled with starlight" compresses setting/action. Final image ("bare feet planted firm") avoids closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms rebellion trope through barefoot intimacy with spaceport debris and opera glasses' flawed lenses. Emotional specificity in "clumsy assurance" avoids generic hope; stone circle's hum as communication method feels fresh yet coherent within world logic.</comment>
