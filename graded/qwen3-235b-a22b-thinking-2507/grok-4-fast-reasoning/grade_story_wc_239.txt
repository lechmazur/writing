<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; witness's flaw (self-doubt) remains abstract without embodied struggle. Micro-choices like tracing "end" to "cessation" reveal value hierarchy but lack visceral cost escalation. Motivation is clear but internal conflict stays intellectualized, missing the 9+ gate's simultaneous contradictory action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis with conceptual cost (history's echoes fading), but cost proof is thin—"authentic silence" feels unearned. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (density increase through etymological unraveling), held cleanly. Orientation succeeds early with "shadows clung to shelves," avoiding penalties.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Temple library constrains choices via "spectral librarians" and shelf realignment, charging the final image. Sensory details like "dust's descent" and "soft cover's sigh" are purposeful and POV-filtered. Micro-setting (dictionary) functions as environment by shaping arbitration tactics, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes (unraveling cosmic illusions) tighten via "spiral arbitration" deepening, but cost remains conceptual—no visible price alters tactics. Escalation is driven by agency (flipping dictionary pages), yet "fragile glass" shattering lacks felt consequence. Band guardrail for 8.8+ unmet: no tangible price charges the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through dictionary's etymologies reweighting "reality" and "end," avoiding moralizing. Final image ("authentic silence") offers non-literal answer to cosmic deception. But "unified cosmos, bare and true" edges toward thematic resolution without sufficient ambiguity, missing the 9+ test's complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: witness notices "languages of vanished worlds" through a cartographer's precision. Rhythm modulates under pressure ("wanderingly exact" to "resonant hush"). Zero head-hopping; elision ("eons had etched lines") taught early and paid off in closure's quiet wholeness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose dazzles with "skins of extinct stars" but suffers density overload in peak beats ("mirrored fates, and echoes masquerading as origins"). Template cadence ("each crease a chronicle...") appears in arbitration scene, triggering −0.4. Final image ("dictionary's soft cover a final sigh") avoids closure-dulling artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic witness + humble dictionary transforms tropes. "Spiral arbitration" reconfigures familiar "unraveling illusions" through etymological rigor. Avoids safety middle via "universe's hiccup" specificity, but emotional truth lacks human-scale stakes, capping near 8.8 without the 9+ risk-distinction bonus.</comment>
