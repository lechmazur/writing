<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("eager hope and guarded doubt") is concrete but motivation ("rewrite fractured past") remains abstractly stated without embodied cost; "cautious flame" metaphor risks therapy-speak in peak moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lacks visible cost—entry to library grants triumph without foreclosed path; "sliver of wariness" about second letter feels tacked-on rather than earned consequence under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mist functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (alley navigation, library reveal) and charges final image ("mist curling like protective shroud"); fog-shrouded alleys pressure tactics via watch's glow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes (finding library) tighten via cipher solution but lack visceral cost; "burgeoning excitement" flattens tension, and wariness vanishes upon entry without trade-off scaling to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</comment><comment>Theme of silenced voices emerges through library's "symphony of silenced voices" without moralizing, but "fractured past" resolution feels unearned; final image reweights "unspoken words" conceptually.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "nocturnal flower" cipher description and rhythmic control ("tick...chime...echo"), though filter verbs ("realizing it concealed") dilute immediacy during high-pressure decoding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>"Motivation ignited like a cautious flame" creates mixed metaphor (bubbling liquid vs. igniting fire); minor synonym churn ("restrained joy"/"exuberant wonder") in climax beats dulls propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of confidence man lore with library mythos, but "propagation delays" feels like untransformed tech jargon; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
