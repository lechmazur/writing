<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "knew better—but old beliefs lingered," yet elder's role lacks pressure; orphan backstory functional but crystalline stress trait underutilized as mere metaphor rather than constraining choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with luminous dust swirling, but cost feels underweighted—dissolving crystals lack visceral sacrifice; "storms would come again" softens stakes despite earned endurance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floating rock platform actively constrains ritual choices; crow quill's recurring use charges final image as scars become "stars trapped in script"—environment and tool fuse to reconfigure meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single tightening—stress crystals pricking during inscription—narrows options to quill ritual, but external storm threat remains distant; internal agency drives climax yet lacks layered escalation beyond physical pain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "scars reborn as tales" crystallizes without moralizing; final image reweights "crow feathers holding secrets" into luminous resilience—earned subtext in every rune.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("saturated hush," "wisps of cloud") masterfully filters urgency, but elder's silent nod risks POV leakage—whose "shared understanding" is this? Near-perfect voice modulation under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor metaphor muddle: "lightning forked like angry veins" strains biological coherence; "crystals" repetition (5x in climax) edges toward scaffold, yet line propulsion remains taut through sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "healing ritual" trope via sky nomad runes and crystalline stress physics; crow superstition feels fresh, though orphan backstory verges on archetype—elevated by precise tea-ceremony stakes.</comment>
