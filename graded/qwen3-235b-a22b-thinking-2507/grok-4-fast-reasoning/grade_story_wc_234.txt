<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident (Thorne's shell as talisman/cage), but "scientifically romantic" remains label over embodied trait; Thorne's cartographer role lacks pressure beyond holding the shell.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: transformed shell hums with "inner glow" reconfiguring separation into connection, with felt cost in Thorne's admission of outdated valuations of loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ember nexus actively constrains choice—twilight dictates timing for alchemy—and the nautilus shell charges the final image as a "portable nexus," though occupational details feel ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Thorne's reversal: shell shifts from cage to beacon through alchemy, with visible cost in his vulnerability, but "palette of resolve" lacks causal pressure beyond thematic echo.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through shell's transformation (chambers of memory → beacon), but "scientifically romantic" and "palette of resolve" risk thematic echo without sufficient integration into action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (alchemist's light-focused lexicon vs. cartographer's spatial metaphors), though dialogue convergence occurs in the whispered confession beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Overwritten phrases ("logarithmic grace," "mathematical poetry") dilute high-pressure beats; minor scaffold in "scientifically romantic" repetitions, but propulsion remains strong until final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scientific and poetic tropes (nautilus columella as emotional metric), though "pocket-sun" concept leans toward familiar magical realism without distinctive transformation.</comment>
