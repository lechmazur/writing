<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear but abstract; lacks contradictory impulses or visible cost beyond isolation. Interiority poetic but stays thematic, not embodied in pivotal choices like thread-untangling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (sanctuary opening with shadows stirring), cost legible in "inevitable pursuit." Lens ambiguity past midpoint (-0.3) as accumulative/textural drive isn't firmly taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid snow/courtyard imagery charges final image (rainbows on snow) but doesn't constrain choices. Micro-setting (threads) lacks tactical impact; prism sanctuary's light matters thematically but not causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early ("peril of discovery"), escalation through thread-untangling deepens density. Cost felt in closing shadows but not visibly charged in final image per 8.8+ band guardrail.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "echoes" motif; finale's "veiling path forward" offers resonant non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing but "alarming serenity" borders on thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bodily poetic," "sonnets") with rhythmic control. Repetition of "bodily poetic" (3x) flattens voice under pressure, slightly undermining 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong density but "alarming serenity" paraphrase loop (mid-story vs. finale) and "bodily poetic" label repetition create scaffold. Minor artifact caps 9+ eligibility despite clean closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Chaste courtesan" trope transformed through voice; "harvest of echoes" concept feels fresh. Avoids safety middle but prism sanctuary leans generic, limiting 9+ distinction.</comment>
