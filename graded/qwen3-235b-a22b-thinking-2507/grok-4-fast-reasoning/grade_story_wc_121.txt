<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "doubts and alternate lives coiled like serpents" and shadow-self confrontation; embodied emotion avoids labels. Minor abstraction in "conquer the labyrinth" phrasing slightly softens final cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "timelines fusing in a cascade of light" reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost ("her self whole at last"). Orientation clear by word 20; Hybrid lens (causal buildup to accumulative reconfiguration) holds flawlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Viaduct's glow actively constrains entry timing ("syncing with viaduct's light") and charges final image ("rain-scented air renewed"). Rain residue's evaporation blurs time boundaries, directly altering tactics—meets 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: confronting shadow-self ("unleashed her power") narrows options to fusion or dissolution. Cost crystallizes in "walls regenerating into tighter coils"—visible tradeoff that alters final tactics under Hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through "procedural generation" mechanics; final fusion image reweights fractured timelines without moralizing. "Periodically eternal" concept integrates with emotional arc via "timelines fusing," avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("gravity defier" framing shapes all description); rhythm modulates under pressure ("confronting the shadow-self" uses sharper syntax). No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts purposefully during climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold, but "darkening brightness that promised revelation" edges toward abstraction in high-pressure beat. Final line ("rain-scented air renewed") avoids sentimentality; no artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Retracing" action transforms labyrinth trope through specific subconscious mechanics; emotional truth in "solitude over connection" fracture avoids cliché. Risk-taking in procedural generation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
