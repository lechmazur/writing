<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her resentment vs duty, embodied through graceless motions and the pivotal wave to the child. Micro-choice of using the nut despite fear crystallizes her arc with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: birds' shift to harmonious chirps and Elara's lingering reconfigure her role with visible cost in sweat and emotional thaw. Causal lens holds from nut discovery to frost-kissed resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The nut functions as micro-setting that charges the final image ("frost crystals kissed the leaves, testament to her offhandedly exact intervention"), constraining her tactics through precise placement under time pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally as frost approaches; her assembly choice forecloses inaction with physical/emotional cost. Agency drives escalation: reluctance melts only when cries pierce her resolve, narrowing options to act or fail.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of reluctant duty transforming into purpose emerges non-literally through the final frost-crystal image reweighting "graceless beauty," avoiding moralizing while resonating with the orchard's curse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("brass wings glinting offhandedly exact," "clumsy ballet of beauty and error") modulates rhythm under stress, with no head-hopping and consistent psychic distance in single POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "offhandedly exact" repetition gains meaning through context. Final line's crystalline specificity ("frost crystals kissed the leaves") delivers propulsion without figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis reframes "graceless beauty" as emotional truth—mechanical birds shifting from predators to shepherds avoids steampunk tropes while heightening stakes through specific, verifiable detail.</comment>
