<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's "forgiving skeptic" interiority avoids diagnostic labels through embodied contradictions (e.g., "shrewdly innocent" hands trembling while setting splints), but the off-page daughter limits relationship-as-crucible depth despite micro-choices like placing the tooth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with cost ("heart once cleft, now whole") under a Hybrid lens (causal ritual + accumulative nostalgia), though the tooth's ritual dissolution slightly over-resolves the physical theft without sufficient emotional forfeiture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The secret garden functions as micro-setting: wild roses constrain choices (blocking paths), the fountain charges closure via rippling water revealing laughter, and moss-embedded tooth integrates tactile detail with thematic weight ("pearlescent, etched with faint runes").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate credibly from skepticism to ritual action under Accumulative/Textural lens, but the "wooden effigy" resolution feels coincidental rather than earned through Elara's agency—the fairies' theft isn't confronted, muting the cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (bone-setting as metaphor for mending family), but final paragraph's explicit "nostalgic innovation" statement violates organic emergence, triggering -0.6 penalty for thematic echo despite resonant imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("fingers trailing clipped yew as if seeking reassurance"), with rhythmic control tightening during ritual ("arranged splints in star-like pattern"), though minor tense shifts in reflection ("had always been") slightly disrupt psychic distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero closure artifacts, but adjacent-line synonym churn ("skepticism urged... But the tooth's warmth cracked open that cleft") triggers -0.2; otherwise impeccable propulsion ("Pushing through final hedge" → ritual action) and texture-specific diction ("birch splints," "herbal poultice").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms changeling tropes through bone-setter protagonist and "mistakes into constellations" metaphor, though "forgiving skeptic" framing leans familiar; specificity in ritual mechanics (rune alignment, splint arrangement) elevates freshness beyond genre conventions.</comment>
