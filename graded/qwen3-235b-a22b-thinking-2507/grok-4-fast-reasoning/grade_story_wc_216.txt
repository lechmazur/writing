<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in tactile time perception ("gritty weave of loss"), but lacks contradictory impulses during climax; micro-choices like embedding codes reveal hierarchy of values without sufficient internal friction at critical juncture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly ("suddenly timeless, his borrowed ledger erased") with conceptual cost in final image, but causal ellipsis in capsule assembly ("guided by embedded clues") slightly obscures pressure escalation toward revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Emerald silo functions as micro-setting that charges closure ("walls pulsing with newfound timeless rhythm"); recurring urn fragment constrains choice throughout and transforms final image into tactile revelation of time's texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elias' agency in reconstructing capsule, narrowing options to single decisive act with visible cost (silo's transformation); "borrowed ledger erased" crystallizes conceptual trade-off under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars ("sand turned to silk," "mosaic of joys and regrets"), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights time as "soft persistence of connection" without stated moral, though "mourned orphan" backstory slightly over-tells motivation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("hours stretched into sentiments") with rhythmic control during stress; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure's cadence shift, though reflection on Mira slightly over-explains prior to revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density, but "hours stretched into sentiments rather than seconds" triggers thematic echo penalty (-0.4) mid-beat; otherwise flawless propulsion through concrete verbs ("pried," "pulsed," "trembled") in high-pressure sequences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-as-texture concept through specific mechanics (garage sale codes, urn fragment), but "borrowed-time" trope slightly derivative; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
