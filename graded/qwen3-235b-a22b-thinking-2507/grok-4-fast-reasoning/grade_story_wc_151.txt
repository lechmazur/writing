<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (analog longing vs. digital world), but motivation lacks active friction; closure choice feels earned though micro-choices under pressure remain underdeveloped during the chalk encoding climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with palpable cost ("chalk would linger until rain or footsteps erased them"), yet escalation lacks decisive intensification; one tightening suffices but the Accumulative lens feels slightly under-driven in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Golden arcade functions as active micro-setting—wet pavement constrains chalk application, holograms pressure juxtaposition choices, and the final mailbox image charges closure with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elias's method, but pressure lacks tangible opposition; time urgency ("before sealing the envelope") remains abstract rather than viscerally constraining tactics during encoding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through chalk's impermanence versus digital permanence, culminating in the mailbox juxtaposition that reweights "margins" without moralizing; final line resonates as earned conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("synthetic dew," "iridescent alloys") controls rhythm under pressure, though minor register drift in "method he cherished" slightly dilutes focalization during reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with no scaffold loops, but "screamed subtlety" creates figurative tension in a peak beat; final line’s mist metaphor avoids closure muddle while sustaining propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synthesizes cyberpunk tropes with tactile nostalgia through irreplaceable specifics (black-market chalk, clipboard smudges); risk-taking elevates stakes without gimmickry, transforming "meaning in margins" into visceral code.</comment>
