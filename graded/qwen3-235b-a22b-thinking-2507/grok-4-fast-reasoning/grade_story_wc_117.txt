<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority shines in embodied grief (crushing sage leaf, harmonica guidance) but "soft as her laugh" veers into label-speak. Final choice lacks contradictory impulses; Theo's shift feels earned through tactile details like the curl's transfer.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors delayed past 120 words ("Sage Ridge" appears line 40) triggering -0.4 penalty. Closure as Charged Poise works (tears + pocketed curl), but cost proof weakens at eclipse peak where light returns too neatly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Capped at 7.0 due to Q2 orientation penalty. Sage ridge constrains choices (crushing leaves, root imagery) yet "dreaming roots" remains decorative. Final image lacks micro-setting constraint—curl's physical fragility doesn't alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen organically: Theo's guardedness tightens through harmonica faltering, then flows with shared breath. Cost is visible in his tears—not sorrow alone but dawning wonder—reconfiguring "ordinary magic" from abstract to embodied.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Eclipses of the soul" final line risks thematic echo but avoids moralizing by rooting in prior imagery. Theme emerges through sage's endurance and adaptive harmonica play, though "lifelong wonder" motivation edges toward tell.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Capped at 7.8 from Q2 orientation penalty. Voice distinctness falters in high-pressure beats ("cautious exuberance" repeats verbatim). Perceptual signature strong (music-therapist lens on sound) but psychic distance slips during eclipse description.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Filter-verb stacks weaken pressure ("Elena felt," "she perceived"). Yet "notes weaving through hush like threads of light" shows rhythmic control. Final image avoids overwriting—"exuberance budding cautiously" lands with earned specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Transforms grief ritual tropes through sensory details (sage scent, harmonica breath). Risk-taking in Accumulative/Textural lens pays off, but "ordinary magic" concept leans familiar. Emotional specificity in Theo's tears elevates beyond template.</comment>
