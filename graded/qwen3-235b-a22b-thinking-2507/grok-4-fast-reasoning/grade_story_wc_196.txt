<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in concrete details (ink-stained fingers, dust patterns as "secretive script") grounds Eliza's grief. Final choice to transcribe earns her "tactfully hopeful" shift through prior causality—Josiah's story mirrors her loss—but the transition from "broken heart" to quiet hope lacks sufficient contradictory impulses in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly: dust patterns → hidden flap → Josiah's file tightens pressure toward Earned Stasis closure. Cost is legible in "tentative mending" and "quiet bloom," but the convenient dust-revealed flap slightly undermines organic escalation despite poetic justification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dust motes and humidity-warping ledgers function as micro-setting that constrains choice—Eliza "reads" dust patterns to find the flap. The infantry button charges the final image (her tracing it), fulfilling the 9+ gate by making environment an active participant in closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Eliza's agency: her motivation to "magnify small kindnesses" drives the discovery, tightening options as Josiah's story reframes her grief. Cost is visible in her physical tremors and emotional shift, though the Reconstruction timeframe ("after emancipation") lacks a live clock to heighten tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars—Josiah's rifle-stock doll and wildflowers—not moralizing. Final image ("archives exhaled in gratitude") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "unknown histories," reweighting the premise without stating a moral. Avoids sentimentality via concrete stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Eliza's archivist mind transforms dust into "secretive script." Rhythmic control under pressure ("her breath caught as she smoothed the paper") avoids filter verbs. Minor tension in "tactfully hopeful" phrasing, but voice modulates perfectly with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("tarnished but defiant" conveys history in two words). Final line avoids purple prose through earned resonance. Slight abstraction in "perpetual shadow under her eyes" borders cliché but doesn't dull closure—cost remains legible in physical details like trembling hands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synthesizes Reconstruction-era microhistories with fresh specificity (rifle-stock doll, Pennsylvania wildflowers). Emotional truth in grief-to-hope arc avoids templates. Risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens stakes—dust patterns as narrative engine—without gimmickry, making the ordinary profoundly resonant.</comment>
