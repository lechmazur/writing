<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak but "geography of grief" edges toward abstraction; bodily cost of vigil ("body aching") grounds the final endurance without over-tidying emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the transformed plate reconfigures grief's meaning with felt cost ("body aching"), though the solstice's "world exhale" slightly softens the earned stillness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The withered orchard's skeletal trees and subarctic frost actively constrain Elara's movements ("numb yet steady fingers"), while brittle leaves and rusted nails become essential tools charging the final map's creation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through alchemical action: translating heartbeats into maps shifts from personal grief to collective sorrow, but the solstice's arrival lacks causal pressure that could heighten the final sealing moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete ritual—starlight seeping "like ink into parchment"—avoiding moralizing; the final map offers resonant ambiguity about navigating grief without resolving its cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in tactile details ("bottle shards fracturing light into latitude lines"); rhythmic control intensifies during the ritual with purposeful compression taught early via "moving stillness."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffolding; "shattered bottles glinting like fallen ice" exemplifies textural specificity. One paraphrase loop ("patterns... mosaic... patterns") slightly muddies the ritual's mid-beat without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes through flash-paper alchemy: the specificity of "rusty nails aligning like meridians" synthesizes emotional truth with tangible world logic, avoiding abstract universality.</comment>
