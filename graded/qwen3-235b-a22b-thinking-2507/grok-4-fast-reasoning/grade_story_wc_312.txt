<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "brittle devotion" versus "naive earnestness," with embodied cost during bell mending ("doubts crept in, visions of Lira's fading smile"). Therapy-speak ("naive earnestness") slightly mars peak beats but avoids severe deduction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: bell's toll creates ripples with visible cost ("brittle devotion tested him"). Accumulative lens holds through drip-pattern escalation, though mid-scene "plink-plink" timing lacks sufficient causal weight for 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sapphire viaduct functions as essential micro-setting—drips constrain choices (positioning bell under drip-point) and charge the final image ("drips steadying to an even rhythm"). Sensory hierarchy perfectly mirrors Elias's urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias's agency (adjusting for wind, decoding seven-second intervals) reweights stakes under Accumulative lens. Cost ("doubts testing devotion") is legible but slightly undersold in the climax compared to setup's "brittle" fragility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: drip-patterns as cosmic heartbeat, bell mending as balance restoration. Final image ("world... exhaled in relief") resonates without moralizing, though "impossibility made plausible" edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("reluctant promises," "salt-crusted bones of waves") with rhythmic control under pressure. Stress compresses diction effectively ("plink-plink") without POV leakage. Minor cadence uniformity in drip-timing section prevents 9.2.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("last fish was caught the night before" implies collapse). Figurative language serves theme ("drips... Morse code of grievance"). Final line slightly generic ("bridge to what was lost") prevents 9.4.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Lukewarm mage" trope transformed via sapphire viaduct tears and bronze-sapphire mending. Emotional truth in "brittle devotion" avoids safety middle, but "plausible impossibility" concept lacks fresh inflection beyond established magical realism.</comment>
