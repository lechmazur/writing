<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses in Elias; woman/skeptic interactions lack agency, reducing relationship pressure. Motivation stated but not tested through struggle. Interiority concrete yet one-note under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis with conceptual cost ("glisten fading into twilight"), but escalation lacks meaningful deepening—sculpture works perfectly without complication or narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Iceberg fragment constrains choice and charges closure via fading glisten, but bluff setting remains postcard-like; fails to actively pressure tactics despite vivid atmosphere. Over-reliance on visual sensory detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes declared early but pressure never tightens—woman/skeptic transformations occur without resistance. Escalation via density (bells crescendo) qualifies under accumulative lens, yet lacks Elias-driven agency or live-option foreclosure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ice-refracted light and "color of wonder," avoiding moralizing. Final line edges toward thematic echo ("harmonized a fractured world") but saved by "resonant note" image recharging prior motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("spirit a quiet forge of sound") with rhythmic control during activation. Minor register drift ("crude filter of speech") disrupts lyrical consistency under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density falters in "hearts grown too accustomed to the wordless hush" (cliché abstraction). No closure artifacts, but stacked modifiers ("prismatic veils... ethereal glows") dilute propulsion in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of climate anxiety and wonder via iceberg fragment, yet "symphonies of truth" trope feels familiar. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
