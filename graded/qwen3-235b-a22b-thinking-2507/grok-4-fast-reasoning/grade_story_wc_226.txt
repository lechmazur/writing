<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation burns clearly but lacks contradictory impulses in climax; her youthful betrayal surfaces yet fails to create visible tradeoffs when she pushes forward. Thorne's interiority remains underdeveloped despite refracted confession, reducing emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost: "bearing the weight of all those splintered truths, each one a shard embedding deeper into the heart" crystallizes the price. Orientation anchors canyon setting by word 15, and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through refracted chorus payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Towers of bone function as micro-setting that constrains choice (alcoves for sessions), while the pale spire's quartz veins charging with "refracted light of their words" charges the final image. Sensory details stay POV-filtered but verge on overwriting in bone-dust storm description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elara's agency: refracting truth narrows options as her own guilt threatens to "overwhelm the spectrum," forcing endurance with felt cost. Pressure coheres via Accumulative lens, though ritual's looming shadow lacks tangible escalation beyond Thorne's poem.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "splintered truths" motif, avoiding moralizing despite near-miss in "price of forgiveness" line. Final image of echoes carrying "refracted chorus" offers non-literal answer to truth/forgiveness question, but Thorne's "ghost in the bone" risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in bone-dust "gales" and "cracked" silence; rhythmic control intensifies during poetry sessions. Elara's "innocently mischievous" voice modulates perfectly under pressure, with no head-hopping despite group scenes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft dazzles but exhibits minor overwriting: "forged hush, a silence hammered into shape" repeats concepts. Template cadence appears in "she refracted... each line... she refracted..." yet maintains propulsion toward closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of truth-refraction through poetry avoids allegory clichés, with "bone dust" survival guilt transforming forgiveness mechanics. Bold risk in Accumulative structure pays off, though canyon setting leans slightly on fantasy tropes without full transformation.</comment>
