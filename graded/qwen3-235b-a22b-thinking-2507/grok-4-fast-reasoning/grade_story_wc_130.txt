<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elowen’s grief-as-equation struggle, but single-character limits relationship crucible; "ambiguous loss" drives embodied micro-choices (aligning glass eyes) with visible cost in the final lightening of heart.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the orchard’s "buried optimism" crystallizes Elowen’s reconfigured calculus (loss as expansion, not subtraction), with felt cost in her "lighter heart" acknowledging grief’s persistent weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cavern orchard’s dripping stalactites actively constrain ritual timing ("rhythmic plinks" pacing her incantation), while the mosaic stone’s fractures directly enable the dovetailing action, charging the final image of "resilient equations blooming in the dark."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quantifying grief) tightens through moonlight progression and glass eyes’ refraction, but escalation lacks tangible cost escalation beyond emotional shift; the "undefined variable" insight deepens stakes yet feels psychologically earned without physical trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the orchard’s "resilient equations" and Elowen’s calculus, avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights loss as "a new term" without stating a moral, though "buried optimism" slightly over-signals the tone shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("callused yet gentle" hands tracing fractures) and rhythmic control under pressure ("plinks that nourished the soil" syncing with incantation) create immersive focalization; zero head-hopping despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; "crystalline tears" and "fractal echoes" integrate seamlessly into action. Minor overwriting in "laughter in the wind" (0.2 deduction) but no closure-impacting artifacts; propulsion remains relentless through tactile verbs ("dovetailing," "murmuring formulas").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via mathematical lens and cavern orchard specificity; "dovetailing grief into grace" feels inevitable yet fresh. Avoids safety-middle by embracing ambiguity without resolution, though stakes could feel more urgent for 9.0+.</comment>
