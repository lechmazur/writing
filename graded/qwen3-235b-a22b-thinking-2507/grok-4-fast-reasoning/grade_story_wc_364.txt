<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation intensifies credibly to high-stakes ritual, with micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values (bartering tools, deliberate strikes). Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak beat; "quiet resolve steeling" leans abstract over embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (frayed silk, confusion yielding), but escalation lacks a meaningful mid-scene deepening—pressure builds linearly without narrowing options until payoff tremor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting (silk) constrains choices and charges final image ("frayed but triumphant"), with sensory details filtered through blacksmith's lens. Avoids 9.0 as luminous ore veins don't tactically shape the ritual mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency (descent forecloses safety path) with unmistakable cost (silk's fraying), but internal conflict remains underdeveloped; wants/needs tension lacks moral calculus depth at peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image reweights "azure defiance" as active hope without moralizing, emerging from ritual particulars. Slight deduction for "bartered awakenings" naming risking thematic echo, though not in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (noticing tools/textures) with rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift in "liminal epoch" and slight overwriting in descriptive beats prevent 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but ritual scene's "threads weaving into cracks like defiant roots" creates minor figurative muddle. No closure artifacts, yet peak-beat modifiers slightly blur immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "orchard planet" with crystalline decay and quiet heroism; risk-taking heightens stakes. Avoids 9.0 as some beats (lone hero saving world) feel familiar despite strong transformation via specificity.</comment>
