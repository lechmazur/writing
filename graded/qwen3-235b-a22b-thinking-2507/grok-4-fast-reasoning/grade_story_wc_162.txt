<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied through wood-grain analysis and feather metaphor, but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; final choice aligns with established motivation yet misses micro-choice showing value hierarchy during terrace arrangement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as perfect Charged Poise: terrace tilting toward cornfield while "necessary distances" crystallize with felt cost in "world mending in whispers"; orientation clear by 68 words, but logbook's sudden appearance strains causality despite thematic justification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prism terrace creates immersive atmosphere yet fails to constrain choices; logbook's weather codes charge closure but micro-setting doesn't alter tactics—arranging prisms remains metaphorical rather than spatially pressured.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation as "sacred thresholds" tighten, but agency stays passive—Elara intuits rather than decides; cost ("lost child rediscovering paths") earned through accumulated meaning yet lacks visible tactical trade-off during prism arrangement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly through corn maze/logbook parallels without moralizing; final "mending in whispers" reweights "necessary distances" as resonant non-literal answer; avoids thematic echo by letting logbook annotations embody wisdom rather than state it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "featherly determined" and wood-grain noticing, but "pilots navigated by such codes" slips into generic exposition; rhythmic control under pressure remains exemplary with no head-hopping in single-POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor figurative muddle in "knots like storm clouds, ridges like wind-swept plains" risks mixed metaphor; template cadence in analysis sequence costs 0.1, but final line achieves crystalline propulsion without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms butterfly effect through aviation/weather code lens; "necessary distances" fresh synthesis feels inevitable; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry as prism refraction becomes emotional calculus.</comment>
