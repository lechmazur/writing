<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("ennui vs. curiosity") drives tangible choices; embodied emotion in "curse hum against her skin" avoids abstraction; final endurance ("plotting next storm") earns cost through tactile amulet handling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("void within her cracked") crystallizes stakes with visible cost; Accumulative escalation via sensory density ("prisms shattering into portals") holds lens; orientation anchored by word 20 ("immortal lounged against walls").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prismatic walls actively constrain choices (she manipulates them during breach); amulet fragment functions as micro-setting charging final image ("tucked it away, pulse reminder"); "hushed thunder" sensory hierarchy reflects urgency without checklist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (boredom vs. discovery) tightens via magnetic fields narrowing options to embrace mutiny; agency clear in "wove intrigue into chaos"; cost legible in "void within her cracked" foreclosing eternal passivity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars ("luminous hush where echoes reformed"), not abstraction; final image reweights "after goodbye" as transformation without moralizing; avoids thematic echo via character-particular insight ("quiet revolution of the soul").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature filtered through dimensional awareness ("magnetically aware as she was"); rhythmic control modulates under pressure ("storm's roar muffled to distant rumble"); consistent POV without head-hopping despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "amplified her ennui" slightly tells; otherwise high density ("kaleidoscope of what-ifs" does triple duty); no closure-dulling artifacts; final line's "hushed thunder" recharges motif with zero loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic mechanics and emotional intimacy ("spatial mutiny" as rebellion against boredom); specific details like "crimson crystal veins" avoid tropes; risk-taking with Accumulative structure pays off through earned sensory accumulation.</comment>
