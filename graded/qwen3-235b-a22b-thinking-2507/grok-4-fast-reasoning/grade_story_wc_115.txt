<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias's skepticism versus emerging belief, embodied through valve wheel handling and parallel guilt. Final realization earns closure via prior causality, but "drowsy alertness" repetition slightly dilutes embodied specificity during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: ghost's confession crystallizes Elias's stance with conceptual cost ("truth's heavy measure"). Orientation clear by para 1; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory pressure. Minor lens ambiguity early prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tunnel actively constrains choice—walls "breathe," radio static amplifies isolation—while valve wheel (micro-setting) charges climax. "Frozen tears" simile risks ornamentalism but avoids cliché through tactile reuse. Environment definitively shapes final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confronting guilt) tightens through ghost's confession, forcing Elias's realization. Radio calls feel slightly convenient as escalation device, but agency in appraising parallels earns cost. One meaningful deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: valve wheel beads reweight "swallowed truth" without moralizing. Final image ("truth's heavy measure") offers resonant answer to central question. Avoids sentimentality by anchoring insight in physical talisman.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("drowsy alertness," industrial lexicon) modulates with pressure. Ghost's dialogue carries subtext ("You're here for it, ain't ya?"), but "reckless heart pounding" verges on cliché. Rhythmic control elevates tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, though "drowsy alertness" repetition creates subtle loop. "Skeletal frames whispering secrets" risks mixed metaphor but stays grounded. Zero artifacts dulling closure; propulsion accelerates during confession beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope through industrial guilt specificity. Valve wheel as shared folly symbol feels inevitable in hindsight. Avoids safety-middle via unflinching parallel secrets. Emotional truth anchors universality without genericism.</comment>
