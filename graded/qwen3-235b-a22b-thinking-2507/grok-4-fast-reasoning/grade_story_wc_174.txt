<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "serenity cracked" and micro-choice of stick-as-baton, but epiphany about puppets reversing agency leans abstract without embodied cost in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: "argument's embers cooled into clarity" crystallizes cost, but "turned toward dawn" lacks specific physical toll to reach 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Meteor hush and story stick constrain choice—stick's weight forces reversal, final image charges it—but radar dome remains atmospheric backdrop without tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via causal "because/therefore" (argument → doubt → reversal), but moral cost stays conceptual; needs visceral fracture like torn manuscript to elevate beyond "felt" cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete particulars: "calligraphic curses that bit deeper than any blade" rejects moralizing; final image reweights ethics without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("calligrapher's precision") shines, but "half-lit epiphanies" recurs as thematic echo without evolving POV bias under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Zero loops but "fleeting insights illuminated corners of his soul" risks abstraction; elevated diction in epiphany beats slightly clashes with calligrapher's tactile POV lexicon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "ethical artist" trope via specific puppet-show mechanics; "reclaim campfire stick's essence" offers fresh inflection beyond redemption arcs.</comment>
