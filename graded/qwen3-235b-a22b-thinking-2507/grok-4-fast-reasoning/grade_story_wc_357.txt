<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear motivation but lacks contradictory impulses; resolution feels earned yet cost remains conceptual rather than embodied. Interiority stays at surface-level urgency without deeper emotional texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost (guardianship burden), but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—gravity inversion functions as backdrop rather than active pressure point narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Environment constrains choices decisively: rivers as navigation tool directly shapes inversion tactics and charges final image. Floating arches supply critical resources (anchors), though dual suns feel ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early but escalation remains passive—protagonist reacts to inversion rather than driving pressure through agency. Cost is conceptual (guardianship) yet lacks visceral weight in closure beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through arrow tip's growth acceleration, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("resilience now hers to safeguard") resonantly reweights premise without stating a moral, though thematic complexity is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (pilot's sensory focus) shines, but voice lacks modulation under peak stress—lyrical cadence remains uniform during inversion rather than compressing with urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("water arcing upward"/"upside-down waterfalls") and repetitive "gathering echoes" phrasing create scaffold without obscuring closure. High density otherwise with precise botanical imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ecological sci-fi tropes through gravity-inversion navigation, though ancient pilot backstory feels familiar. Risk-taking in sensory logic (auditory ghosts) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
