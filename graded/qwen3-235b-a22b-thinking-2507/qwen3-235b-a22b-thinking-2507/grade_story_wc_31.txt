<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in synesthesia is concrete, with micro-choices like avoiding timbers under pressure. Interior contradiction lacks simultaneous tension—longing for color manifests as wonder rather than struggle. Final renunciation of external compass direction is earned but cost remains abstract, missing visceral tradeoff at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as Aris grasps the compass points inward, with cost felt in "sea sighed against the hull" preserving secrets. Drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density buildup to the golden-fire reflection moment. Cost proof is oblique—no on-page sentence crystallizes paid price, narrowly missing 9.0 eligibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the key tag constrains choices (aligning symbols) and charges the final image (compass reorientation). Lantern beam cutting silt and "meteor hush" atmosphere directly shape tactics and closure. Meets 9+ gate by making tool indispensable to both discovery and thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Aris's deciphering of vows and key tag, narrowing options toward the emerald tone revelation. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens but lacks visible cost—no forfeiture alters tactics beyond internal shift. Band guardrail blocks 8.8+ as the "courage" glow remains untethered to sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sailor vows as "echoes absorbed," crystallized in "compass points inward" reweighting the quest. Avoids moralizing while offering non-literal answer to "color of sound." Slightly undermined by "luminous vows require darkness" near-final line bordering on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines via synesthesia lens ("sapphire bled from the page"), with rhythmic control in high-pressure discovery beats. Minor scaffold in duplicated "wandered purposefully" phrasing disrupts consistency. No head-hopping; voice modulates perfectly from procedural (lantern adjustment) to transcendent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loop in "wandered purposefully" repetitions dulls momentum. Final third contains artifacts (redundant "meteor hush" reference), disallowing 9+. Otherwise stellar density—phosphorescent algae vows convey complex history in two words. No closure-dulling muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms "color of sound" via sailor vows in sunken library, avoiding abstraction through concrete phosphorescent text. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passed—swap maritime setting and premise collapses.</comment>
