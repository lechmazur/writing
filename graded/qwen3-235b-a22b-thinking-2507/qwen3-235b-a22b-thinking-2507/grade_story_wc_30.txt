<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s embodied emotion ("thoughts sluggish," "hand steady despite the moon’s wane") and contradictory impulses (preserving vs. surrendering stories) anchor her motivation, but moon-phase fluctuation lacks visible tradeoffs in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "preserving wonder meant honoring transience" crystallizes stance with felt cost ("surrender to the flux"), perfectly executing the Accumulative/Textural lens through tidal rhythm and creel reprise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Tidal Atrium constrains choices (smelting during low tide, creel threatened by surging water) and charges closure; "grinding bones" gear sounds directly shape Elara’s actions and emotional weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving migrating identities) tightens when the creel "hummed" during smelting, forcing Elara’s stance crystallization; cost is legible in "hand steady despite the moon’s wane" but moon-phase constraint remains passive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: smelting broken gears into new scrolls embodies "contradiction is the ore," with the final heartbeat-warm gear offering a resonant, non-literal answer to transience without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("minnows sensing deeper currents," "brass glowing like captured stars") modulates with tide cycles, but "migrating identities" repetition borders on template cadence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with high density ("furnace roared, molten brass glowing like captured stars"), but minor paraphrase loop: "fragile against the industrial gloom" echoes "industrial gloom" three lines later.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms archive tropes through specific mechanics (smelting gears for renewal), with the creel’s evolution embodying risk-taking; emotional truth in "wonder lived, unbroken" avoids generic abstraction.</comment>
