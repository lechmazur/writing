<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("sincerely insincere") embodied through cloak/mirror; Mrs. Gable reflection lacks full BRR compliance (alters present tactics insufficiently), costing 0.3 in high band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost (discarded cloak = vulnerability); wind chime reconfiguration (E-flat/F-sharp to D natural) perfectly reweights stakes under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse functions as micro-setting: chimes constrain choices via pitch code, mirror shard charges final image with "pale light... complex, contradictory, alive" – environment directly shapes closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation via Elias realizing his professional method must apply to himself; cost legible in "cloak pool[ing] at his feet," but campfire reference slightly weakens causal urgency in dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image ("nuance wasn't weakness; it was the only true certainty") reweights theme without moralizing; hollow mirror's transformed reflection offers non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (chime pitches, tactile cloak details), but "hollow mirror shard" repetition creates subtle register drift into thematic abstraction near climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("polished but hollow, like the mirror shard" → "hollow center reflecting not his face"); high-density prose otherwise flawless with rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "lighthouse keeper" trope via moral philosophy tools (wind chime code, hollow mirror); "conscience for hire" profession feels fresh in its application to doubt rather than certainty.</comment>
