<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her trawling-as-penance versus seeking endings' sound; embodied emotion in numb fingers scraping frost and the parasol's engraving biting her palm reveals character under pressure without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands when she breathes in the glacier's sigh with windborne solace settling deep—cost is her fractured reality reconfigured through presence, not escape; Accumulative lens holds via density shift in the final vibration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina constrains every choice: shovel scraping ice, fissure racing beneath her, refrozen dock anchoring the climax; environment charges the final image as she listens to the marina's breath.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through her agency: trawling debris to learn endings' language culminates in hearing the glacier's sigh—a deepening where pressure shifts from seeking to embracing the sound's grace with felt cost in her surrender.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—parasol vision, ice groans, windborne solace—without moralizing; the final image reweights endings as carrying grace, a resonant answer to "learn the sound of approaching endings" through lived experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "windborne solace" and "fold in patience" reframes Arctic sensory details; rhythmic control under pressure peaks with the high-pure vibration line, compressing tension without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "tarnished silver tip of an heirloom lace parasol" exemplifies textural specificity; propulsion through strong verbs ("shattered," "dissolved," "crystallized") with no figurative muddle in the ice-crack climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms euthanasia-tourist trope through the "fold in patience" concept—fresh synthesis where patience snaps into listening; risk-taking heightens stakes via Arctic setting as active metaphor without gimmickry.</comment>
