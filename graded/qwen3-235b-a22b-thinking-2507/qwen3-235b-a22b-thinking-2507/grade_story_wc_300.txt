<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete choices (kneeling, placing pearl) with embodied contradiction; confessions avoid thematic echo by being diegetic artifacts. "Professional distance... began to soften" shows earned change without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: resonant hush density builds to Charged Poise closure where "walls weren't stone; they were fear" carries conceptual cost. Orientation test passed at 110 words with "Sector Gamma-7" anchor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Crystal caves constrain perception (quartz absorbing light) and charge final image, but orientation penalty from Q2 caps score. "Cold stone biting through trousers" exemplifies tactile specificity without static cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single deepening—pearl's revelation—narrows options to entomb or honor confessions. Aris' crown action forecloses decommissioning with visible cost: "professional distance... began to soften" under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "cultivated pearl" mechanics, not moralizing. Final image ("light, shared and quiet") reweights "resonant hush" into earned resonance without stating "dissolve walls" thesis directly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines via geological lexicon ("milky quartz," "geodes") shifting to emotional texture. Compression ("latent radiance exploded—not as blinding light...") taught early and paid in climax, but orientation cap limits band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats; "shattered geodes" and "waterlogged journals" deliver textural density. Minor "resonant hush" repetition (4x) avoided penalty as patterned accumulation under lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms "magical artifact" trope through emotional specificity: confessions as "surrendered dreams" in cultivated pearl feel inevitable. Risk of abstraction countered by concrete "shoe leather" details (crunching grit, rusted cots).</comment>
