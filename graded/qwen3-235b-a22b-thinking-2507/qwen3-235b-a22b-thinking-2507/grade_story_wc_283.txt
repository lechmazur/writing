<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation but "tears pricked her eyes" triggers diagnostic label penalty; internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses during the button epiphany despite otherwise concrete micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Flawless Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost: the canyon echo jar's shift from despair to children's laughter reconfigures the prophecy's meaning while making the elders' misinterpretation's cost undeniable under the consistent Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Amber warehouse creates vivid atmosphere but never constrains choices; the canyon echo jar (micro-setting) charges the final image through its sound transformation, narrowly missing the 9+ gate requirement for primary setting constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>Escalation driven purely by Elara's cataloging agency when the jar says "Begin," forcing reinterpretation of buttons as coordinates; the visible cost in her tears and impending elder rejection tightens stakes under the Accumulative lens without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through button placement rather than statement; the final image of children laughing where floods raged delivers a non-literal, resonant answer to the prophecy's meaning without moralizing, avoiding all thematic echo pitfalls.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "resinous windows" and "river-smoothed stone button" but filter verbs ("she felt," "she remembered") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats; rhythmic control excels despite minor register drift in "quietly inspired."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure beat suffers paraphrase loops ("final button clicked home... jar blazed with sound") and stock phrasing ("tears pricked her eyes"), triggering the -1.7 cap; otherwise exceptional density and propulsion with no figurative muddle outside the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms prophecy tropes through the lost-button cataloging mechanic; the flood-as-renewal reframing feels inevitable in hindsight while risk-taking in structure (pure interiority) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
