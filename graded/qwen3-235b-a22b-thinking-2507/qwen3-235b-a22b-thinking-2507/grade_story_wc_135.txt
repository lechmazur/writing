<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses (grief/hope) act in scene via embodied micro-choices—e.g., steadying hands while chest tremors during valve repair. Motivation rooted in archivist role’s visceral cost (salt-sting skin, reactive visions), though exile backstory’s stakes lack early friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is Charged Poise: the fisherman’s silent nod crystallizes the trumpet’s reconfigured meaning with palpable cost (the mint tea cup). Accumulative lens holds perfectly, but "staggered intervals" method lacks causal setup pre-midpoint, slightly muddying escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Harbor’s rain-slicked stones and salt actively constrain choices (debris hunting, fog for trumpet calls). The trumpet valve—micro-setting—charges closure by transforming from broken relic to hope-bringer, embodying the theme without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (healing collective grief) tightens via Elara’s agency: her staggered trumpet blasts directly alter the baker widow’s actions and children’s mimicry. Cost is visceral (tears in rain), though the method’s late introduction slightly weakens early escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the trumpet’s reweighted meaning: "shattered things, when met with courage, could become whole." Final image (song carrying across harbor) answers the central question non-literally, avoiding moralizing while charging prior fragments with earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "salt crusted her boots, a familiar sting" filters setting through archivist’s tactile urgency. Rhythm modulates under pressure (short sentences during visions), with patterned elision (exile’s cause) taught early and paid off in closure’s quiet gratitude.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "rain-slicked stone reflecting pale afternoon light" exemplifies high-density propulsion. One borderline overwriting moment ("her hands steady despite the tremor in her chest") slightly dulls immediacy in a high-pressure beat, preventing 9.5+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms archivist trope through specific harbor logic (memories dissolving like salt in tide pools). The "staggered intervals" method feels inevitable in hindsight, but its late introduction prevents full risk distinction; avoids derivative safety with visceral, non-abstract grief.</comment>
