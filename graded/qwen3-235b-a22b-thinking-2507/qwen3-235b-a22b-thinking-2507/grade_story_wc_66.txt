<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion ("trembling ink," "rough wool comfort") and copyist precision shaping micro-choices, but internal conflict between rebellion/restoration lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal moments; motivation clear but not tested through competing values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Flawless Accumulative/Textural closure: dust's luminous glow creates Charged Poise where silence breaks with visible cost (tears, kneeling), reconfiguring stakes through prior lyrical accumulation; orientation anchored by word 15 ("ember alcove’s warmth").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ember alcove functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (ember-light enables dust-cloaking) and charges final image (dust settling on stone floor with story-sounds); "secretly luminous" glow evolves from radio detail to dust’s inherent property with tangible stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through lyrical density accumulation, but broadcast signal strengthening relies on coincidence rather than protagonist agency; visible cost (physical/emotional toll) lands unmistakably at climax, yet escalation lacks causal driver from Elara’s choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars ("dust remembering violins") without moralizing; final mist image reweights "story famine" with resonant conceptual cost ("glimmers... whispering"), satisfying non-literal answer requirement while avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("copyist’s discipline," "conductor’s baton shaping chaos") with rhythmic control modulating under pressure; purposeful elision of famine backstory taught early and paid off in "orchestras silenced" reflection without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "thistled calm" avoids cliché through context, zero paraphrase loops, and lyrical density reserved for low-pressure moments; minor register drift ("fragile counterpoint") barely dents otherwise impeccable line-level integration with closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of music/dust motifs transforms post-apocalyptic tropes; "secretly luminous" glow evolves organically from radio to dust with conceptual integrity, while emotional specificity ("orchestras reduced to dust") avoids generic templates through lived detail.</comment>
