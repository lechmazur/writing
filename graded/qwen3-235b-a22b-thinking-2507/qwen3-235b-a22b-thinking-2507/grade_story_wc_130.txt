<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids diagnostic labels through embodied vectors ("violet grief threads") and micro-choices (aligning glass eyes with mosaic chips). Contradictory impulses manifest in "gently inventive" approach vs "physical ache" of loss, but "mathematics of emotion" risks slight abstraction in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: the single water drop crystallizes "ambiguous loss" as "interval" with brother/orchard parallel. Accumulative escalation intensifies through vector density → mosaic alignment → formula emergence, all driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cavern orchard functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice (drip absence as problem, mosaic chips as solution guide). Final image of water drop "falling into waiting blossom cup" charges the environment with thematic weight, fulfilling 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding silence to resolve ambiguous loss) tightens through protagonist's vector-mosaic alignment, narrowing options from observation to geometric revelation. Cost is unmistakable in "broken patterns could hold meaning" realization with brother/orchard parallel.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (dovetailing vectors via chipped patterns), not abstraction. Final image "renewed whisper a promise" offers resonant non-literal answer to central question without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite "mathematics of emotion" phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "stalactites hung like frozen tears" and "violet grief threads," with rhythmic control shifting from dense vectors to sparse "A single stalactite... shuddered." Zero head-hopping; compression taught early pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fractured vectors of color" maintains metaphor coherence. Information density peaks in climax ("sorrow’s sharp angles fitting into hope’s curves like puzzle pieces") with clear propulsion. Final line "renewed whisper a promise" crystallizes closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "ambiguous loss" through mathematical lens via concrete details (cobalt glass eyes, chipped triangles). Fresh synthesis feels inevitable: "emotion was not chaos but geometry" emerges organically from orchard/mosaic logic, avoiding safety-middle hedging.</comment>
