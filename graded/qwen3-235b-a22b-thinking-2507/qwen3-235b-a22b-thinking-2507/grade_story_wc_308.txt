<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction absent; reverence remains unwavering despite profound stakes. Motivation ("navigate without moving") brilliantly embodied through stone-skimming and dust observation, but micro-choices lack competing impulses during pivotal arrowhead discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly: starling patterns intensify resonance into closure. Cost crystallizes when arrowhead is reburies as "seed for next seeker"—a conceptual sacrifice charging the Charged Poise. Orientation anchors by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Towers of bone and obsidian arrowhead constrain choices: the latter’s vibrations directly map terrain onto the skimmer’s mind. Dust motes and canyon echoes evolve from static detail into active navigation tools, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deciphering the pulse) tightens via starling patterns revealing the arrowhead’s language. Escalation peaks when birds’ spirals mirror vibrations, narrowing options to either keep or bury the compass—with the cost being its deliberate relinquishment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "navigation without movement" resolves not as abstraction but via arrowhead reburial. Avoids moralizing, though "wisdom was in the stillness" risks thematic echo, slightly muddying the earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature shines: "dust motes dancing in slanted sunlight" filtered through a seeker’s gaze. Rhythmic control under pressure peaks in the starling sequence ("spearhead diving earthward"), with zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; "bruised twilight sky" risks overwriting but earns payoff in "violet dusk." Final line’s "singing him forward" avoids sentimentality through physicality. Minor redundancy in "centuries of layered dust" appearance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms navigation tropes through harmonic resonance and dust-as-chronometer. "Cold fire mapping valleys" offers fresh inflection, though "pulse left wandering" leans derivative. Bold risk in making stillness the climax, fully integrated without gimmickry.</comment>
