<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority leans poetic ("thistle-blown hope fluttering in her chest") but lacks embodied contradiction under peak stress; micro-choices like shard adjustment reveal value hierarchy, yet emotional calibration feels overly precise without irrationality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: beacon's "fragile as a thistle seed" glow reconfigures meaning with visible cost (tears, trembling), while Accumulative/Textural lens holds through pattern-weaving; Vega alignment forces decisive tightening without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thistles evolve from "fragile promises" to "swirling in golden eddies," charging the final image and constraining choices (seeds obscure vision during alignment); shard of hush actively shapes tactics, though "threadbare robes" borders ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes ("silence would swallow everything") tighten via Vega's descent, forcing final adjustment, but cost remains abstractly emotional; pressure coheres through Accumulative lens yet lacks concrete tactical price beyond exhaustion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through thistle/lark/star patterns: final image reweights "coincidences" as proven meaning without moralizing; avoids thematic echo by embedding wisdom in golden seed eddies rather than direct statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice modulates rhythm effectively (short sentences during climax: "One degree more"), but lyrical density risks overwriting in high-pressure beats like "drinking the light until the pavilion fell utterly still."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor synonym churn ("fragile promises"/"lost prayers") and thematic repetition of "coincidences" slightly dull closure impact; otherwise, sentence variation and concrete verbs ("thistle seeds caught the radiance") propel momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes via specific mechanics (retrocognition through objects, "shard of hush" physics); thistle motif synthesizes emotional truth with world logic, avoiding derivative safety-middle choices.</comment>
