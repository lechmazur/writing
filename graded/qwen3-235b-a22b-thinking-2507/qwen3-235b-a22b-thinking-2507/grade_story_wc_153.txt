<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority excels with embodied emotion ("wound in her palm a mirror to that old, unhealed rift"), but secondary pressure is absent since sister isn't on-page; micro-choices like evoking despite bleeding showcase contradictory impulses under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: moonlight healing the wound while dissolving letters crystallizes the cost of understanding ("the terrifying freedom of the choice before the choice"), with Accumulative lens driving density increase toward the gate-latch revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mangrove roots function as micro-setting that charges the final image (condensation dissolving into night), but "skeletal window" root description edges toward symbolic convenience without sufficient constraint on mid-scene choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding the unspoken apology space) tightens through Elara's escalating evocations, with the blood-payment cost visible in her stumbling; minor friction as the labyrinth's "demand" lacks concrete physical constraint beyond emotional toll.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the shard's evolution from weapon to "relic of fierce tenderness," with the final image ("courage to stand in the space where apologies waited") offering resonant, non-literal resolution to the central question of unsaid words.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in stress-filtered details ("singing spirits’ melodies shifting from lullaby to warning hum"), though minor register drift occurs in "fracture" (clinical) versus "shattered glass" (visceral) during peak tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density ("condensation bloomed instantly... forming words—fragments"), but "bruised twilight" cliché slightly dulls momentum; final line’s rhythmic control ("spirits’ song now a gentle guide") elevates closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief-as-labyrinth avoids template tropes through specific mechanics (condensation messages), though mangrove spirits risk derivative resonance; emotional truth in "hand on the gate" moment transcends surface novelty.</comment>
