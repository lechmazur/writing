<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses (medical reality vs. creating meaning) drive choices; Aris’s embodied reactions avoid sentimentality. Minor flaw: Aris lacks interior conflict, but single-POV focus justifies it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: Aris’s serene death reconfigures stakes with visceral cost ("sigh softer than the wind, he let go"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory escalation to final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rooftop garden and vinyl shard constrain choices (only fragment exists, forcing adaptation) and charge closure ("broken shard warm in her palm"). Lavender/damp earth scents evolve causally with Aris’s release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (flawless goodbye vs. sterile protocols) tightens via Elara’s agency (rooftop insistence), with cost legible in Aris’s death. Escalation through sensory accumulation meets Accumulative lens demands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (hymning mundane, scent of damp earth), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "scent of hope" as release without abstraction, satisfying non-literal answer test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (Elara’s sound-focused noticing) and rhythmic control ("hiss-click" cadence) deepen under pressure. Slight register drift in "serene hospice music therapist" but voice remains consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but "pulsing stillness" repetition in final beats creates minor scaffold loop (-0.2). Figurative language ("scent of hope clinging like rain trace") avoids muddle despite complexity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms hospice trope via "hymning the mundane" specificity and vinyl shard’s irreplaceable role. Risk-taking (sound-as-closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
