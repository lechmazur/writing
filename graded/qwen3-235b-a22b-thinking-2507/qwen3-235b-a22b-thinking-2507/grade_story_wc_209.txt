<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s shift from shouting pain on walls to seeking quiet truth; embodied grief via stained fingers and tear-blurred ink avoids therapy-speak. Final choice to paint with "umbral tenderness" earns closure through prior causality—Leo’s notes reframe her artistic impulse without artificial flaw-balancing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: "some truths bloom only when we stop demanding answers" crystallizes her stance shift with felt cost (vanishing snow mirroring surrendered resistance). Accumulative lens holds—dawning hush intensifies pressure through light patterns, not causal beats—and cost proof is visible in her quiet brushstrokes foreclosing months of loud mourning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The etched-glass window (micro-setting) constrains choice by enabling the lemon juice revelation, charging the final mural’s design. Sensory details like "honey-colored wood" and "cold stone floor" filter through Elara’s grief, avoiding white-room syndrome; snow’s melt tracks emotional thaw without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Accumulative pressure: Leo’s "hidden layers" clue forces Elara to seek cathedral light, narrowing options from fire/steam to dawn’s fractured beams. Cost is legible when she trades loud murals for quiet creation—this single escalation reweights her artistic identity under the lens, though secondary stakes remain underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: night-blooming flowers become metaphors for grief’s quiet revelations, not abstract moralizing. Final image of dawn-lit petals rejects "screaming life" for "umbral tenderness," offering resonant answer to "why bloom at night?" without stating a thesis—earned through the postcards’ visceral journey.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Elara’s artist eye notices "amber cobalt" light fracturing, while grief narrows her to tactile details (velvet pouch, cold stone). Voice modulates from "hesitant breath" of spring to "quiet certainty" of creation, avoiding uniform stress-tics; no head-hopping in single-POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "snow glistened like scattered stars" risks cliché but gains specificity through "pale morning sun" context. Sentence rhythm breathes with scene needs—short phrases during cathedral tension ("She held a postcard"), flowing cadence in closure. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via botanical specificity: moonflowers and midnight orchids aren’t generic symbols but catalysts for "umbral tenderness" as active philosophy. Emotional truth anchors the fresh synthesis—Elara’s murals "scream life" until she learns darkness "reveals"—avoiding safety-middle choices.</comment>
