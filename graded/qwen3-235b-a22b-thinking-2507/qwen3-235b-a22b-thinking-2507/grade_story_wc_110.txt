<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses (observer/participant) drive micro-choices under pressure; musicians' embodied conflict shows status dynamics via hovering hand/strap adjustment. Slightly weakened by summarized "years of professional jealousy" rather than dramatized friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "her small act of transparency dissolving her own isolation" crystallizes reconfigured stakes. Accumulative escalation (doodles→lens→eavesdropping→participation) holds under textural lens with resonant final image charging prior material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt functions as micro-setting: its acoustic properties constrain eavesdropping choices and charge the final image where "wet stones" reflect "profound peace," transforming earlier "resonant hush" into active participant in the reconciliation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elara's agency: lens magnification deepens knowledge (doodles→coordinates), eavesdropping tightens stakes, and her transparency act forecloses observer complicity. Cost legible in dissolved isolation; musicians' reconciliation slightly abrupt but redeemed by doodle mirroring.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: strap adjustment and annotated tickets embody "honesty enacted," avoiding moralizing. Final image ("echo of trust restored") answers central question non-literally. Minor slip: "freed by honesty" phrasing risks thematic echo but quickly redeemed by action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fracturing light into liquid stars") and rhythmic control under pressure; compression taught early (damp paper revealing cryptic marks) pays off in closure. Slight register flicker in "mistrust festered" offset by strong embodied observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("resonant hush where even a sigh could travel") with propulsion. Every line advances atmosphere/character: "glistening surfaces holding music's memory" recharges setting. "Fostered" slightly clinical but fits musical context without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence as communication medium; projector lens magnifying doodles transforms observer trope. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final "resonant hush... filled with trust" feels inevitable through prior particulars.</comment>
