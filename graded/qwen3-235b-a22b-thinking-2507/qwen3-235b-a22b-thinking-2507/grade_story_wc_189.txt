<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (tradition vs. understanding) drives micro-choices like focusing on the droplet; embodied emotion avoids labels ("fingers reading... like braille"). Kael’s off-page presence sharpens her internal conflict without on-page dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost: "necessary friction that polished understanding smooth" crystallizes the stakes. Accumulative lens holds—pressure tightens via sensory density, not causal turns, with cost legible in the tide metaphor foreclosing her resistance path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The droplet (micro-setting) constrains her epiphany, refracting stars into "thousand fractured points" that charge the final image. Grotto’s dampness and stars directly enable the closure’s "quiet certainty of the tide returning," meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by her agency (choosing tangential approach) deepens the stake—Kael’s frustration becomes "high tide and low tide of learning." Cost is unmistakable: her resistance transforms into acceptance of cyclical tension within the pause.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the droplet’s refraction and cicada symbolism, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights conflict as natural rhythm ("tide returning"), offering resonant non-literal answer to "texture of time" without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in marine biologist’s tactile focus ("damp wall... like braille"); syntax mirrors contemplation with semicolon-rich flow. Stress compression consistent ("Time, she realized..."), no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "droplet trembled, capturing... minute tremor of her breath" advances setting, character, and theme simultaneously. One hairline slip—"warmly observant" slightly label-like before immediate embodiment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms mentor conflict via marine biology lens; "high tide and low tide of learning" synthesizes stakes with tidal specificity. Emotional truth in cyclical tension avoids genericity—this premise couldn’t work elsewhere.</comment>
