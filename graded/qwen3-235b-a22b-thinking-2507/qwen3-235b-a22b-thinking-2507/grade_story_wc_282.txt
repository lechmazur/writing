<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s dual reliance on science ("spectrometer") and "factually mystical" fossil, with embodied panic ("breath fogging the visor") and earned closure renunciation of isolation. No diagnostic labels; micro-choices like pocketing the fossil crystallize value hierarchy under cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "tears blurred her vision" as fossil’s meaning shifts from personal talisman to communal beacon, reweighting premise under Accumulative/Textural lens. Emotional residue heatmap progression narrows options toward this crystallization without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Coastal cave network constrains every choice—from silt-sinking boots to tidal pool residue—while the fossil’s micro-setting charges the final image ("living archive"). Sensory selection (salt-scoured winds, subterranean echoes) mirrors urgency, with brackish water’s ripples embodying hope’s physicality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving human resilience) tightens via Elara’s agency: spectrometer calibration transforms abstract hope into tangible heat signature. Cost is visceral—dissolved isolation through tears—and the fossil’s levitation forces stance crystallization under Accumulative pressure, no coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through fossil’s evolution from transitional object to "spectral conversation," avoiding moralizing. Final image ("living archive") reweights prior material non-literally, though "human resilience persisted in the land itself" edges toward thematic echo in penultimate paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters limestone heat signatures through cartographer’s lens ("wave pattern: deep blue despair cresting into violent orange anxiety"). Rhythmic control shifts from clinical ("Sensory log Gamma") to lyrical ("unseen hands") under pressure, with no POV drift in single-character scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("mystical warmth radiating from its surface, a steady pulse against her skin" merges object, sensation, and theme). Final beat’s "dissolving her isolation" slightly overwrites embodied cost, but no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes via "sensory cartographer" lens and "factually mystical" fossil. Fresh inflection: emotional heat-mapping as literalized hope, with coastal caves as living archive. Avoids safety middle by embracing lyrical science without gimmickry.</comment>
