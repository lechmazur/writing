<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority lacks embodied contradiction; "synesthetically blessed" functions as label not lived struggle. Final epiphany ("wonder is essential") feels unearned by specific cost—no visible tradeoff in execution. Micro-choices reveal value hierarchy (aurora-guided ringing) but diagnostic phrasing undermines authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) reconfigures "wonder as essential" with conceptual cost, but cost remains abstract ("world crumbles") without on-page legibility. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through aurora-guided escalation, yet cost proof test fails—no exact sentence/image grounds the price. Strong setup but passive resolution via coincidence (aurora's arrival).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Ice cavern’s starlight/aurora creates vivid texture, but environment doesn’t constrain choices—Kael could perform ritual anywhere. Amber sheet functions as micro-setting object charging closure (dull sheet = spent magic), yet spatial choreography lacks pressure on tactics. Recurring "oscillating repose" subtly mirrors internal state but misses 9+ gate for environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certify wonder) tightens via chisel-strike timing, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—Kael merely follows aurora hues. Cost ("world crumbles") is declared not dramatized; no visible forfeiture or altered tactics. Band guardrail for 8.8+ fails: no price charges final image, though "sculpted hush" reweights meaning through Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (child pausing for leaf), but final paragraph’s explicit moralizing ("wonder is essential, as vital as breath") triggers -0.7 penalty for thematic echo. Ending offers resonant non-literal answer via "hush spreading one heart at time," yet moral absolutism ("humanity was a hollow shell") undermines complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines (synesthesia as "symphony in mind"), but filter-verb stacks ("he felt," "he knew," "he thought") dull immediacy in closure beat. Rhythmic control under pressure falters with template cadence ("He touched... He understood... He smiled..."). Voice modulates well but cohesion frays in high-stakes moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Filter-verb stacks in closure beat (≥3 lines) trigger -0.5 penalty and disallow 9+ globally. Paraphrase loops ("oscillating repose" x5 with identical phrasing) and overwriting in aurora sequence ("fractured into rainbow spectrum... shifting hues") muddle peak beats. Strong opening/final lines but momentum loss from scaffold verbs in high-pressure scenes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "sculpted hush" and synesthetic music creates emotional specificity, though premise echoes "art saves world" templates without sufficient transformation. Risk-taking with Accumulative structure pays off—aurora’s colors reconfigure wonder’s stakes—but derivative safety in moral absolutism caps ingenuity. Authentic vision in sensory details elevates execution.</comment>
