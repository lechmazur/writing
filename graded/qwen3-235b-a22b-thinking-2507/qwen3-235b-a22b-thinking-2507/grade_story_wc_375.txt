<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "mnemonically gifted" trait enabling memory yet paralyzing art; embodied cost clear in trembling charcoal and tears. "Terror of creation" sketch avoids therapy-speak through visceral action. Slight over-reliance on sorrow motif weakens emotional layering at peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with crystalline cost: laughter's fade becomes necessary silence for creation. Accumulative lens holds—density shift from "weeping shadows" to "vessel filled" reweights creative cost. Midpoint lock mechanism slightly convenient but redeemed by grandfather's thematic numbers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Crystal cave constrains every choice: bioluminescence guides her touch, fissure location forces kneeling, quartz sliver becomes tool. Final image charges setting when "auroral sorrow" transforms into "crucible," making stone inseparable from rebirth. No generic placeholder details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: blank sketchbook → lock repair → hidden sketch confrontation. Cost crystallizes in tears tracing "clean paths through dust"—a tangible forfeiture of creative death. Pressure tightens via cave's humming intensifying as she acts, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "rectify the silence" redefines creativity as dialogue with stone, not self-expression. Final image of laughter-fade portrait answers central question without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by embedding wisdom in charcoal's "unbearable weight of release."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "charcoal-fingered hands tracing rough walls" filters setting through artist's tactile need. Rhythm modulates from lyrical sorrow to staccato urgency ("kneeling, she worked") under pressure. Zero head-hopping; focalization consistent even during memory-shard.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "auroral sorrow" motif evolves without repetition. Final line’s "vessel finally filled" achieves conceptual repricing with crystalline clarity. Slight overwriting in "weeping shadows that mirrored the ache" but redeemed by earned payoff in closing pulse shift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms artist’s-block trope through mnemonic specificity and stone-as-muse. Emotional truth in "terror of creation" sketch avoids cliché. Risk-taking in situational pressure (cave as antagonist) heightens stakes without gimmickry; the lock’s broken state proves indispensable.</comment>
