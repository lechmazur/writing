<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices (kneeling/waiting vs. pouring longing), but "unassumingly bold" trait leans slightly tell-y in peak pressure; no secondary character limits relationship crucible testing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands flawlessly—"courage was never lost, only waiting to be unwound" crystallizes cost via the ribbon's transformation, though lens (Accumulative/Textural) could be tighter in escalation beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Alley bricks and ribbon constrain choices (knot loosening via Vega's light), but cosmic disorientation lacks tangible pressure on tactics; nebulas/time-river distract from micro-setting potential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via Aris's "improbable longing" as pressure, yet "fear’s vault" remains abstract; cost is felt but not viscerally tied to her physical state beyond "ache like a bruise" during climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through starlight/courage synthesis; "fear’s vault undone by wanting freedom" avoids moralizing, though "collective terror" risks over-abstraction without character-specific consequence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("reading braille" on bricks) and rhythmic control under pressure exceptional; Vega's "silver needle" metaphor deepens voice without muddying causality, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor density overage in disorientation beat ("mind stretching to hold the unholdable") slightly dulls propulsion; otherwise stellar rhythm and specificity ("sighing wind" for ribbon) elevate closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "unlocking courage" trope through tactile starlight mechanics and Charged Poise ending; emotional specificity in "longing so improbable it ached" avoids generic hope narratives.</comment>
