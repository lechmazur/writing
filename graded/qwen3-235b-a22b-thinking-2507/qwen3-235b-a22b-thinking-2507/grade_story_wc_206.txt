<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation (rust covenant) but lacks contradictory impulses; final choice earned yet internal conflict remains externalized through physical stakes rather than layered irrationality under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Decisive Change lands with undeniable cost ("lilies crumbling to ash" → "pushing through the ash"); causal chain holds perfectly from thief's presence to light restoration without retroactive patches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Resonance chamber actively constrains choices (dishonesty causes decay) and charges final image; starlight lilies evolve causally from wilting to regrowth, mirroring the harmonic restoration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Silas' agency (focusing against falsehoods) narrows options to one pivotal harmonic choice; cost legible in rust covenant and lily decay but lacks secondary pressure tightening the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of truth/deception emerges through concrete stakes (oxidation), not abstraction; final lilies-in-ash image reweights "balance" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo in closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust motes danced... wilting starlight lilies") modulates rhythm under pressure; purposeful compression ("mending what isn't torn") taught early with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion ("sweat beaded... metallic taste flooding") but "tinkersong wonder" slightly abstract in peak beat; zero loops yet minor register drift from craft lexicon to conceptual phrasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of music-box repair + harmonic physics transforms tropes; "covenant of rust" creates organic stakes but "in the balance" framing lacks bold risk-taking beyond core premise.</comment>
