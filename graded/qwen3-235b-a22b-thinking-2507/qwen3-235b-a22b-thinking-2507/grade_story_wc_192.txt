<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s simultaneous isolation and connection through shared grief scars; "aching" physicality avoids therapy-speak. Final choice to teach release via memory—kneeling inward not across threshold—earns closure through prior causality of sister’s drowning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: pressure builds via sensory density ("suffocating despair made air heavy") until stillness reweights the threshold. Cost legible in "threshold thinner now" and "sanctuary more desolate" as Charged Poise closure under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Ashen charcoal sanctuary functions as micro-setting: kneeling on "cold ash" constrains action, while final "ash less oppressive" charges closure. Sensory selection ("starlight bled," "charcoal-black fingers") reflects urgency without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten under Accumulative lens as child’s despair "makes air heavy," narrowing Elara’s options to internal remembrance. Cost unmistakable in "threshold thinner now" and desolate sanctuary—pressure coheres without causal turns per valid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "teach suffocating to breathe" becomes literal via shared river trauma. Final doorknocker image—"forgotten promise"—resonantly answers release without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("starlight bled," "whispers curling like cold mist") modulates rhythm under stress: short sentences during crisis ("She didn’t speak; she remembered") teach lyric compression paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density where "loaded emptiness, thick with unshed tears" advances plot/emotion. Figurative language serves pressure: "threshold pulsed weakly" mirrors emotional state without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "threshold guardian" trope via specific grief mechanics ("linking through scars"). Emotional truth in "burned bridges carefully" as necessary severance—not abstraction—creates fresh inflection that feels inevitable.</comment>
