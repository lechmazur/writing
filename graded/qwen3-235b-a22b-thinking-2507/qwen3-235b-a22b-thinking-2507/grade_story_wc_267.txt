<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction burns through embodied nerve-regeneration sensations; micro-choice of kneeling to brush grime reveals hierarchy of values. Slight over-articulation in "fortress’s terrible arithmetic" risks diagnostic label-speak but bolt’s physicality anchors the insight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: "safety’s cost wasn’t eternal" tempered by "unpardonable silence would never lift." Accumulative lens holds through sensory density (grime, bolt, nerve hums) reweighting silence as debt. Cost legible in "leaving would be another kind of death."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cobalt fortress actively constrains choice (nerve regeneration requires staying); piano functions as micro-setting charging closure via bolt offering. "Dusty spiral staircase" isn’t backdrop but discovery site where ochre smudge mechanics matter. Final image of bolt on piano lid crystallizes environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: discoloration discovery deepens abstract "cost of safety" into concrete bolt-relic, narrowing options to remain as witness. Cost unmistakable in "safety required surrender... turning vibrant spirit into seraphically mundane endurance." Accumulative pressure via sensory accumulation reweights silence as moral debt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through bolt’s reweighted meaning: from collapsed piano relic to "promise" of regrowth. Final image ("bolt on piano lid") offers non-literal answer to "cost of safety" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by having action (placement) embody insight rather than state it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in noticing "discoloration" others miss; rhythm modulates from reflective cadence to crisp action ("She knelt. Brushing away grime"). "Seraphically mundane" feels character-particular, not generic. Minor register drift in "terrible arithmetic" offset by physical bolt detail.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence does triple duty ("nerves sparked as she uncovered"). Figurative language sparse but potent ("hope thin as ice"). Final line "frostbitten, yet unbroken" crystallizes tone without overwriting. Bolt’s "stripped threads" exemplify textural specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "silent-choir bellhop" transforms mute trope into sacred penance. "Unpardonable silence" as moral debt (not absence) feels inevitable through fire-bell memory. Risk-taking hinges entire story on piano bolt—audacious specificity that pays off in closure.</comment>
