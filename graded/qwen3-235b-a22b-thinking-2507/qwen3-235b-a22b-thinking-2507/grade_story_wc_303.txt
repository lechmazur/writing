<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (protect artifact vs. its meaning) drive the climax; embodied "mulberry ache" avoids therapy-speak. Minor abstraction in "perforated destiny wasn't fate broken" edges toward diagnostic label-speak but doesn't undermine the earned surrender.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("empire's victory hollow against quiet propagation of hope"). BRR violation: coffee stain reading is a reflective block that doesn't alter tactics, triggering Non-closure Accumulation Cap (-0.8) despite strong accumulative lens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ice violin constrains choice (sealing fractures) and charges final image (glowing in Vorlag's hands). "Velvet walls" feel ornamental, but Starlight Bloom's propagation delivers tactile specificity that alters tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through solstice deadline ("time was a tightening noose") and sensory escalation (cereus shriek → scout shouts). Cost is legible in surrender, but coffee stain method doesn't shape tactics, slightly weakening escalation under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Final image ("bloom's new life pulsed beneath soil") reweights "seeds sown unseen" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; abstraction in "choice splintered" is the only near-miss with prompt-like language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mulberry ache," plants' "rasping plea") modulates under stress. Minor register drift in "perforated destiny" abstraction, but rhythmic compression during propagation ("knelt in cool earth") heightens pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("glacial ice never melted yet humming with warmth"). Slight abstraction in "choice splintered" is the sole flaw, but closure beat ("pulse beneath soil") remains crystalline with no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Telepathic plants drive plot (not flavor), transforming trope through specific stakes. "Mulberry ache" as embodied emotion and surrender climax feel fresh; avoids safety-middle by trusting thematic resonance over artifact retention.</comment>
