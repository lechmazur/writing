<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "spirit unmoored—lighter" after duty vs joy tension, but "anguish was the ice" borders on diagnostic abstraction, narrowly avoiding -0.4 penalty through embodied "sun finding way" closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost ("spirit unmoored—lighter... secret warmth"), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through prismatic light pattern break that reweights "tenderness" as stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Icebound spire constrains choices (elevator time pressure) and charges final image ("sun finding way through ice"), while goggles-as-tool shape deciphering tactics and closure warmth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake tightening crystallizes when shadowed elevator threatens revelation loss, then sunbeam refraction forces active choice (tilting goggles), with cost legible in "throat tightened" over dead mint garden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "frozen tears" laughter and snow birds, avoiding moralizing; final line’s "joy was the sun" reweights anguish through concrete physics, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("frost-rimed clouds," "prismatic shards") modulates under stress with compressed syntax ("Panic flickered—would she lose the revelation?"), no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sunlight fractured... scattering into prismatic shards" achieves high density without muddle, and final line’s parallel structure charges closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "found diary" trope via ice/light mechanics; mint garden detail and "frozen tears" laughter synthesize emotional specificity that defies generality.</comment>
