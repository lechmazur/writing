<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion ("veil damp with anticipation," "hands steady despite racing heart") shows contradictory impulses. Minor therapy-speak ("cautious exuberance") slightly undermines authenticity in pivotal moments but final documentation choice is earned through obsessive measurement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds perfectly: decreasing propagation delays (9→5s) create inevitable pressure toward Charged Poise closure. Cost legible in "One more delay. One more number to document" as stakes crystallize. Orientation clear by line 5 with luminous library and mist.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the watch's brass casing and light propagation constrain every choice. Final image ("library held its luminous breath") charged by bioluminescent shelves' rhythm. Mist actively resists movement, making environment causal rather than decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's agency: each documented delay (7s→6s→5s) narrows options under Accumulative lens. Cost is visceral in physical tension ("pulse quickened," "racing heart") and looming "price too steep" of second letter. Dominant stake crystallizes perfectly at zero-second threshold.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete mechanics: "Time Lies, But Light Tells" engraving reweights into library's light-based cipher. Final image avoids moralizing while resonating with cost of silenced voices. No thematic echo despite high conceptual density.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in light-timing precision ("Five. She scribbled it down"). Rhythmic compression under stress avoids uniformity. Slight register drift in "cautious exuberance" repetition prevents 9.0, but POV remains fiercely consistent through final breath-holding moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats; "deep thrum vibrating through stone" shows rather than tells. Minor synonym loop in "cautious exuberance" (appearing twice) prevents 9.0. Propulsion flawless: every sentence advances the countdown toward luminous breath.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "magic library" trope through scientific cipher mechanic. Emotional specificity in obsession with documenting sixty-three delays makes premise feel discovered, not derivative. Risk-taking (light-as-language) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
