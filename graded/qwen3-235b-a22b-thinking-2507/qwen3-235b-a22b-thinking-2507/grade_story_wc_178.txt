<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("empirically ironic" tension between precision and doubt) drives micro-choices like aligning the tile with stars, but overuse of "empirically ironic" veers toward diagnostic label-speak, risking the -0.4 penalty in peak beats despite strong embodied emotion in candle-trembling and palm-pressing moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "new regime would burn his papyri, but this moment sealed beyond regimes" crystallizes the stakes under Accumulative/Textural lens, with the tile's transformation reweighting cosmic reciprocity against human transience. Orientation clear by 40 words ("Babylonian observatory... fading sun between regimes").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (lapis tile) constrains choice and charges closure: its cooling against Kael's palm after the revelation embodies the "frugality" theme, while the "cracked alabaster floor" mirrors decay/discovery balance. Sensory specificity ("cerulean light," "calloused hands") filters through astronomer's POV without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve cosmic covenant before regime erasure) tightens through Kael's agency: aligning the tile with Venus forces the tile's transformation, paying visible price (papyri destruction) that alters tactics (extinguishing candle for starlight). Pressure accumulates via stellar mechanics, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "frugality had made him rich in understanding" reweights "dusky harmony" without moralizing. Final image ("covenant unbreakable... between regimes") offers non-literal answer to "encrypted devotion," avoiding thematic echo despite "empirically ironic" near-misses in mid-scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("skeletal grandeur shadowed by fading sun," "stones settling like bones"), but "empirically ironic" repetition creates syntactic monotony in high-pressure beats. Rhythmic control excels in climax ("tile warmed... numbers shifted like liquid mercury"), with psychic distance shifts serving emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density falters with "empirically ironic" paraphrase loops (3x in key beats), triggering Q7 artifact penalty (-0.6). Otherwise exemplary propulsion: "Aligning the tile's numbers with stellar coordinates" compresses complex action without scaffold. Final line’s "spoken to eternity and been heard" avoids overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms magic square trope through Babylonian context and "frugality as vow" lens. Emotional specificity ("tears pricked his eyes as he understood") avoids generic templates. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off, though "covenant with cosmos" premise borders on familiar without deeper historical transformation.</comment>
