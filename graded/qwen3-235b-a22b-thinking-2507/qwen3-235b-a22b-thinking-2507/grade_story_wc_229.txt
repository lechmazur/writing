<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Eli's trembling hands versus steady focus under pressure; embodied emotion ("tears tracking clean lines through salt crust") avoids therapy-speak. Micro-choice to whisper scent not shout earns closure, though Mara's off-page presence slightly dilutes single-POV causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: ship's course shift crystallizes options while Eli's silent weeping embodies the felt price of shouting's failure. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—pressure tightens through sensory density until the fog thins, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cobalt lighthouse stone and vial constrain choices—Eli presses palm to damp walls, scent sizzles on dewy railing—then charge the final image as he touches sun-warmed paint. Sensory specificity ("midnight violet" perfume, "sea-slicked stone") filters through keeper's urgency without checklist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guiding ship without light/sound) tightens through Eli's scent method: one decisive deepening where vibration replaces shouting. Cost is unmistakable—his throat aches from futile shouts, tears pay the price of silent success. Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through scent's physicality, not moralizing—until the fatal final line: "love travels farthest when it doesn’t demand to be heard" states the thesis. Resonant closure image (re-corked vial as "anchor") nearly saves it, but explicit moralizing triggers Q5 penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>Perceptual signature is keeper-specific: noticing warped lens paint cracks, not seabirds. Rhythmic control under pressure shifts from "oppressive furnace" heat to "cool wave" scent cadence. Zero POV slippage despite fever-flashbacks; lyric compression taught early pays at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; "sizzled faintly on dewy railing" does triple duty (sensory/action/metaphor). One paraphrase risk ("quiet insistence of honeysuckle after rain" echoes prior scent description) narrowly avoids density penalty in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lighthouse keeper using scent as navigation tool transforms "whisper vs shout" trope through tactile garden physics. Emotional truth in "screaming tenderness" avoids abstraction; cobalt paint’s warmth recharged in final touch proves specificity anchors universals.</comment>
