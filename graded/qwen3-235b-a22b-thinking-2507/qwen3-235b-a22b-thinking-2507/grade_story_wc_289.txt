<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("vessel for others' emotions" vs "locked box") and embodied hollowness made concrete through thrush nest observation; final choice earned by tactile micro-choice whispering "I want to belong" with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens clear by midpoint; Charged Poise closure ("archway shimmered... living installation") crystallizes options with undeniable cost of vulnerability; orientation anchored in opening 40 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lotus temple archway constrains choice (weaving medium) and charges final image; thrush nest's "twig spiral" reweights meaning from observation to artistic guide with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (emotional isolation vs connection) tighten through Elara's agency gathering materials; cost legible in "hollowness fill... with collective pulse of shared vulnerability" as options narrow toward public participation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (weaving messages), not abstraction; final image reweights "thread that connects" into tangible silk/reed tapestry without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("prismatic quiet," "fragile promises sealed") modulates with emotional intensity; rhythmic control in high-pressure beats ("hands remembering tactile intimacy") with zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "damp wood tracing" compresses backstory; final line's thrush chirp delivers closure without figurative muddle; syntactic variety supports momentum in weaving sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ghostwriter premise transformed through specific public art execution; emotional truth in "borrowed phrases" vs "shared courage" avoids templates; risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
