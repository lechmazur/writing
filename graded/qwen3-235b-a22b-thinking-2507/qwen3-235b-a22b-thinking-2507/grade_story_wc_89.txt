<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via embodied grief ("hollow ache of a bond severed") and micro-choices (crushing saffron releases memory-laden scent), but "reluctant metamorphosis" label edges toward therapy-speak in high-stakes beat, slightly undermining flaw authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "breathing in the spice-scent, no longer a plea, but a homecoming" crystallizes the cost of acceptance with conceptual weight; Accumulative lens holds as sensory density intensifies toward this reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orchard functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (spice-gathering as "sacred theft"); moonlight’s "paradoxically steady" vibration directly enables the ritual’s success, charging the final image with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (reforging bond beyond death) tighten through Elara’s agency in gathering spices; cost is visceral in "sacred theft" and tears, but the fortune cookie’s sudden appearance slightly softens escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sensory particulars (saffron = "captured sunlight"), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "reluctant metamorphosis" into earned peace without stating a moral, achieving organic resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct (beast-whisperer noticing "thrum of life"), with rhythmic control deepening under pressure; "cosmic intimacy" phrasing risks slight register drift but is redeemed by lyrical cohesion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet precise ("moonlight pooled like liquid mercury"), but "reluctant metamorphosis" repetition creates a minor paraphrase loop in mid-beat, slightly dulling momentum without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Trope transformation is exceptional (phoenix rebirth via spice ritual), but the fortune cookie’s whimsy risks cliché; saved by seamless integration into "cosmic intimacy" logic, making the risk feel inevitable.</comment>
