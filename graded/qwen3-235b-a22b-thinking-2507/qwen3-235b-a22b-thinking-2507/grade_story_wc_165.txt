<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses under pressure; motivation clear but lacks flaw-driven struggle. Final "triumph" lacks visible cost or earned change, violating Earned Stasis requirement. Two distinct non-closure flaws: flat interiority and untested stakes. Bishop object reveals no character depth beyond function.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: receding tide leaves "wet sand and faint memory" with conceptual cost of ephemerality. Lens ambiguity past midpoint—Accumulative/Textural only inferable late—caps high-band eligibility. Orientation flawless (anchored by 40 words), but cost proof lacks visceral punch in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tidal arcade constrains every choice: sand density calculations, brine-slick arches dictate debris placement, starlight enables visibility. Final image ("wet sand and faint memory") charges setting with irreplaceable specificity. Meets 9+ gate via environment shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>No meaningful escalation: tide follows predictions perfectly with zero resistance. "Monotony" stake remains abstract, never viscerally tested. Cost is conceptual (ephemerality) but lacks on-page tradeoff—audience reaction passive, not earned consequence. Pressure stagnates under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "creativity thrives not in defiance of chaos but within its curated edges" shown via symphony’s birth/death. Final image reweights premise without moralizing. Avoids anti-patterns—no thematic echo, balanced complexity in "calculated wilderness" paradox.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "first cold fingers of the rising sea," "bottles chimed, shells trilled" reflect analytical mind. Rhythm modulates perfectly—from clipped tension ("It began—slow, inevitable") to lyrical payoff. Zero head-hopping; elision serves Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor scaffold: "serendipity happened exactly as she’d foreseen" redundantly follows symphony description. Near-metaphor clash: "posture... humming with calculation" muddles embodiment. Final line ("real performance could begin") avoids closure dilution. No artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Orchestrating serendipity" transforms street performance trope via tidal math and bishop-as-baton. Emotional truth in quiet triumph avoids sentimentality. Specificity anchors universals: "ivory smooth by anxious fingers" implies generational struggle. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
