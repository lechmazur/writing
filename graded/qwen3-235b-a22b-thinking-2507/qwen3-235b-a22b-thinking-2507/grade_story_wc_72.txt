<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Internal conflict crystallizes through micro-choices: Aelius' rigid belief "crumbled like the city’s foundations" as he handles the ampoule, embodying "incisively kind" via sorrow not judgment. Final choice earned by cascading revelations, though emotional shift slightly rapid despite ampoule’s pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost: "silt settled like forgiveness" crystallizes conceptual cost of embracing nuance. Causal lens holds tightly—revelations directly motivate threading the filament, with orientation anchored by 100 words ("drowned sanctuary," "three centuries").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Underwater garden constrains choices: silt-covered mosaics dictate movement, coral-buried ampoule requires retrieval. Final image ("garden breathed... beauty of uncertainty") recharges setting’s purpose, meeting 9+ gate through environmental pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully: Aelius’ shift from "rigid certainty" to threading the filament forecloses his prior path. Agency-driven escalation under causal lens; cost legible in "silt settled like forgiveness" as tangible consequence of embracing fracture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: mending stone by "embracing the fracture’s inevitability" reweights certainty/nuance without moralizing. Final image ("beauty of uncertainty embraced") delivers non-literal answer, avoiding thematic echo while charging closure with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "telepathic senses brushed against darting fish" filters world through stone-being’s POV. Rhythmic control peaks in climax ("threaded the glowing strand"), with purposeful elision (Council’s actions) taught early via ampoule’s visions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density in "cascade of revelations began unspooling" where metaphor serves propulsion. Final line avoids sentimentality through concrete action ("stone lips curving"), with no figurative muddle even in high-pressure threading sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms Atlantis trope via specific mechanics: foxglove ampoule’s "woven light" reconfigures geological truth into emotional repair. Risk-taking (quiet closure) heightens stakes through "silt settled like forgiveness" without gimmickry.</comment>
