<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("chronologically homesick" vs. present mission) and embodied exhaustion strengthen motivation, but fortune cookie backstory lacks causal weight in choices; "hollow phrases" mention feels decorative rather than driving current stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (collapse after symphony completion) lands with visible cost (physical surrender), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through memory-density escalation, though time-pressure escalation lacks concrete markers beyond "minutes left."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Nautilus shell functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (temple contact triggers memories) and charges final image (glowing shell), but spire/lake setting remains atmospheric rather than actively shaping tactics beyond providing sonic materials.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (conduct symphony before collapse) tightens via memory accumulation, but exhaustion pressure lacks visceral escalation; "exhaustion nipping at her heels" states rather than dramatizes the narrowing window.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through sensory particulars ("cello note from lake's depths," "harp from ice crystals"), with final image (glowing shell awaiting next solstice) offering resonant, non-literal answer to "unheard symphonies" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in sensory filtering ("almonds bloomed in her mind," "tears froze"), though "chronologically homesick" momentarily drifts into academic diction; lyric compression taught early pays off in closure's emotional charge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("mapped faster, childhood memories aligning like notes" echoes prior mapping descriptions) and horizon description redundancy dull momentum in high-pressure beats; otherwise exceptional rhythm and specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "fortune cookie writer" trope through concrete synesthesia (memories as musical notes) and stakes-specific exhaustion cost; avoids derivative solstice symbolism by grounding "unheard symphonies" in tactile memory physics.</comment>
