<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but lacks contradictory impulses; "empathetically decisive" shown through bilingual plea and chain adjustment, yet no visible flaw complicates choices. Physical strain during repair reveals embodied emotion, but micro-choices remain surface-level (e.g., wrench turns lack value hierarchy). Final endurance earns closure but misses 9+ gate for simultaneous conflicting drives.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: farmers gathering at dawn crystallizes cost (fractured community now mended) with tangible stakes. Orientation solid (Prague tower established by para 1), but lens ambiguity until climax slightly undermines escalation coherence. "Tears pricked Eliska’s eyes" provides unmistakable cost proof; one tightening (chain freed → resonance) suffices for length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clock tower functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choices (jammed chain, spiral stairs climb), with rust and weight charging the closure image. Grain elevator’s "skeletal frame" and "mournful groans" integrate action (wind threading bins guides repair tactics). Avoids white-room syndrome but Vltava valley remains backdrop rather than pressure point; environment narrowly misses 9+ gate for full tactical constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (city-farm disconnection) signaled early via farmers’ whispers; escalation through density increase (vibrations → harmonic dialogue) reweights cost under Accumulative lens. Agency clear in Eliska’s adjustments, with visible cost (physical strain, emotional tears). Single deepening (weight freed → elevator responds) suffices, though secondary stake (clock’s fracture) lacks interweaving with internal conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of sonic connection emerges organically from particulars: "bridges from silos" evolves from metaphor to tangible "sonic arches" without moralizing. Final image ("conducted the stars") reweights prior "borrowed starlight" with conceptual cost (fragile harmony), avoiding thematic echo. No abstract statements; complexity in "vigorous tender" duality reflects earned wisdom through concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("listened to wind in spires") with rhythmic control under pressure (shortened clauses during chain-freeing). Multilingual shifts (Czech/Latin/dialect) feel authentic to librarian role; psychic distance tightens during resonance scene. No POV leakage; stress compresses diction ("vigorously yet tender") without breaking voice. Final line’s lyricism pays off taught pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "rust flaking like dried tears" avoids cliché with purposeful specificity. Sentence rhythm accelerates during climax ("deep, resonant note... low, harmonic chord") without muddling cause/effect. Strategic telling compresses transit (weeks documenting elevator). Minor deduction for "basso profundo" slightly exceeding plausible lexicon, but justified by librarian expertise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-as-connection trope through specific Czech context (Vltava valley, Astronomical Clock). "Sonic arches" concept feels inevitable in hindsight, avoiding sentimentality via tactile repair scene. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure for technical fix) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "vigorous tender" tone transforms familiar emotional arc. No derivative templates; lived detail anchors universality.</comment>
