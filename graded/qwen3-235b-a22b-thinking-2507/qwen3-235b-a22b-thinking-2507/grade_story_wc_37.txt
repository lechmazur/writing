<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via embodied emotion: "panic, cold and sharp" pricking her while she presses palms to soil, rejecting grand hymns for "too small" lullabies. Micro-choices reveal hierarchy—singing despite rough voice—earning the final renunciation of fragmented memory with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands flawlessly: the "bound release" note swaddles the realm while the sunrise blooms, crystallizing options with felt cost in "the last fragment clicking into place." Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density escalation—from single note to communal reconnection—without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mica window constrains every choice: Elara sees decay through it, sings toward it, and witnesses reconnection via its reflection. Final image of sunrise blooming "through the mica window's reflection" charges closure, transforming it from frost-rimed barrier to conduit of rebirth per Q3 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency under Accumulative lens: singing "too small" songs narrows options from passive despair to active weaving, with cost in "voice rough from disuse" and mental strain. Stakes deepen as threads visibly mend villages, though "endless night trembled" slightly overstates tension without concrete trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "knitting communities" shifts from memory fragment to literal golden threads in the woven dawns. Final image of villages "knit together anew" under sunrise answers the central question without moralizing, avoiding abstraction through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "glass fruit glowed with captured starlight" filters observation through alchemical lens. Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure—short, fragmented clauses during panic ("Panic, cold and sharp, pricked at her") yielding to flowing cadence in the singing climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion through layered syntax: "A tear traced a path through the dust on her cheek, landing on dormant sun-seed pods" advances emotion, setting, and plot simultaneously. No figurative muddle in peak beats—"threads of liquid gold" viscerally embodies the weaving stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis: transforming "swaddling" from infant care to cosmic resilience feels inevitable. Risk-taking heightens stakes via Accumulative structure—no grand antagonist, yet the mirror world’s decay intensifies through intimate song fragments, resisting generic apocalypse tropes.</comment>
