<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation via micro-choices (tracing doodle, copying under time pressure), but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal moments; "latent blaze" metaphor risks abstraction without sufficient embodied counterweight during climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly: doodle→navigation→inversion→harvest chain with clear cost (fading symbols, gravity snapback). Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands when vigilance transforms from "seed" to "living system," crystallized in final "latent blaze now kindled" with felt cost of neglect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto's inverted geometry constrains key action (ceiling-as-floor requiring floating navigation), while mist coiling like serpent during inversion charges final image. Only minor deduction for slightly generic "mist parting as if in salute" weakening micro-setting cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally under pressure: countdown ("minutes left"), fading symbols, and "first pebble drifted downward" force urgent copying. Agency clear in harvest timing, cost visible in fading light. Slight over-explanation of "seeds could turn to embers" reduces visceral impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: vigilance evolves from creed ("planted in dark") to living system requiring tending, reweighted by final "blaze" imagery without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—no character states thesis, cost of neglect implied through fading symbols.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("prism mind refracted problem into facets") with rhythmic control during inversion ("silent pop; feet left ground"). Minor abstraction ("latent blaze of ancient purpose") risks dilution but anchored by physical actions like tracing doodle with gloved finger.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "clandestinely luminous" repetition serves motif development. Sentences vary rhythm for pressure ("Rocks began to float upward" vs flowing climax descriptions). Only microscopic issue: "knew only prism mind could reassemble" slightly over-explains during high-stakes beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms archivist trope via gravity inversion mechanic and refractive cognition. "Seeds of vigilance" gains freshness through living-system metaphor and physical constraints. Avoids derivative pitfalls but edges near "wise keeper" cliché without sufficient counterbalance in early beats.</comment>
