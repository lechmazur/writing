<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Embodied stress crystallization drives micro-choices (abandoning tea for quill), avoiding label-speak; contradiction (scholar vs storyteller) acts simultaneously in pivotal lull moment. Only minor flaw: "crystalline burden" edges toward abstraction but redeemed by physical shedding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visible cost (shed crystals = emotional burden), under Accumulative/Textural lens where sensory density reweights stakes. Orientation solid by line 30; cost proof in "leaving only smooth flesh and fresh ink that glowed with inner light" makes stakes undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Floating rock platform constrains choice (vibrates when writing sky-whale lore) and charges final image; micro-setting (tea bowl) transforms crystal into "liquid light." Environment actively shapes tactics—no ornamental description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: crystallization spreading threatens joints, forcing quill use. Cost legible in shed flakes; "profound calm" reweights pressure under Accumulative lens. Dominant stake (fraud vs truth) materializes viscerally in crystallized wrists.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action ("scars could be ink" shown via rune-writing), no moralizing. Final image—dipping quill for "next story"—resonantly answers central question without abstraction, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: sentences shorten under stress ("He froze, breath caught mid-inhale"); "saturated hush" refrains modulate meaning. Rhythmic control peaks when crystals "shed like brittle ice," compressing diction without voice drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; high density ("crystallization, tiny facets forming along his knuckles like frost on glass" advances character and atmosphere). Minor overwriting in "profound calm" but redeemed by concrete "seeped into his bones" embodiment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms anxiety trope through magic-system specificity: crystallization isn't metaphor but literal constraint. Risk-taking (abandoning tea ceremony) heightens stakes; "sky-whales" superstition becomes causal world-rule with platform vibration.</comment>
