<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction weak; "stoic wonder" lacks competing impulses beyond blinking tears. Strength: embodied micro-choices like grease-stained conduit tracing show functionally creative trait under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands perfectly: "hope was a flow" reweights the maze of intentions with undeniable cost in restrained tears. Accumulative lens holds via sensory density shift from "candy wrappers" to humming terminal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sextant fragment constrains choice (aligning relays) and charges final image ("compass pointing to possibility"). Weakness: carnival remnants feel decorative rather than pressure-generating despite "ozone and stale popcorn" anchoring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</comment><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via "redirected flows" concept, but escalation lacks tangible cost beyond emotional restraint. Pressure tightens through energy-resurrection mechanics, though repair sequence feels frictionless ("hands steady despite dust").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "redirected flows" motif; final line reweights decay as hope-source without moralizing. Avoids Thematic Echo by embedding insight in action ("solar arrays repurposed from carnival mirrors").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fluid dynamics with structural physics") persists under stress. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" phrasing, but rhythmic control shines in cadence shift at "sparks hissed".</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; "crystallized final moment" avoids filter-verb stacks. Slight overwriting in "hollow silence, its once-bustling concourses" but density serves Accumulative pressure without dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of engineering pragmatism and poetic hope ("equations for hope"). Derivative spaceport trope transformed by carnival detritus specificity, though "stoic wonder" leans familiar without deeper risk.</comment>
