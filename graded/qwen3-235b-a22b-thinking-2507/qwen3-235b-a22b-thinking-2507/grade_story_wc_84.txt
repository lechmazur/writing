<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation for "frequency of belonging" remains slightly abstract despite embodied actions; "perpetual surprise" trait creates visible tradeoffs during climax (shaking hands vs. drone-honed precision) with cost in "hollow victory" backstory, but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in key beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "she’d been the missing piece all along" crystallizes stance with felt cost ("hollow victory" echoed in softened eyes), under Accumulative/Textural lens where sensory density (star trails → humming stones) reweights belonging as resonance, not location.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ancient observatory functions as micro-setting: "brilliant dimness" hour directly constrains action (star trail visibility), while fractured astrolabe sockets dictate chip insertion timing, charging final image where stones "sang with her" under dusk.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding belonging) escalates through protagonist agency—drone-honed eyes track star trails for precise timing—with cost legible in "hollow victory" past; celestial mechanics narrow options to one split-second choice, avoiding coincidence via skill-based execution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (chip → lullaby hum), not abstraction; final image reweights "brilliant dimness" from ominous to cradling, avoiding moralizing. Slight risk from commander’s "frequency" line but saved by early placement and earned resonance in closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: drone pilot notices "sparrow’s wingbeat" and "raw, silent pull of heavens"; rhythmic control under pressure ("Now! The thought was a silent scream") with purposeful compression taught early. No head-hopping; voice modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("familiar prickle... gasp anew") in opening beats, but high density otherwise; "river of silver" metaphor avoids muddle. Final image’s "frequency humming in her blood" achieves textural specificity without scaffold, though one synonym churn instance limits 9+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "ancient artifact" trope through specific tech (matrix chip from defunct press) and emotional precision; "frequency of belonging" rendered physical via vibrating stones. Risky lyrical structure succeeds as star trail mechanics constrain action, creating fresh synthesis where concept and closure are inseparable.</comment>
