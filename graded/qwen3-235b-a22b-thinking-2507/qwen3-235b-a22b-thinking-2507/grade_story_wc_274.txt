<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses ("conflict warring with duty") manifest physically in micro-choices like finger hover and pod entry. "Bravely conflicted" avoids label-speak through embodied cost: trembling hands, forced calm under enforcers' boots.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost: pod's chill seeping into bones and shivering emergence crystallize the refusal path. Causal lens holds—upload directly triggers enforcers' raid, with "because/therefore" pressure narrowing options to one decisive turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Snow constrains choices (muffling sound for hiding) and charges closure: transforms from "dizzying quiet" to "burying old lies." Cryo-pod's physicality matters—its timer and viewport directly enable the escape, reweighting environment as active participant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single tightening forecloses safety: uploading the letter forces immediate trade-off between truth and survival. Cost is unmistakable—"panic flared, but she forced calm" and the pod's chill—driven by agency when enforcers breach the door.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image ("snow continued to fall, burying the old lies") resonates non-literally with the central question. Theme emerges through concrete action—archiving "new truth"—avoiding moralizing while reweighting "contraband truths" as catalyst for change.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "dormant networks, like forgotten nerves" reflects archivist's precision. Under stress, syntax compresses ("Within the blink... she acted"), while psychic distance shifts intentionally during pod sequence without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion flawless until minor register drift in "scandalize them." Final line ("history began anew") resolves through action, though "dizzying quiet" recurrence risks slight overuse without significant evolution in payoff beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cryo-archives as truth-preserving prison transforms climate fiction tropes. Emotional specificity in "not vengeance but conversation" avoids generic activism, with "forgotten nerves" metaphor organically rooted in archivist POV.</comment>
