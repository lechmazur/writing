<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s shift from alchemical capture to shared vulnerability, but Kael’s limited presence slightly weakens relationship-as-crucible depth despite poignant micro-choices like shell transfer.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "I'm here" crystallizes stakes with visceral cost (tears on dust, capped vial), while ember nexus evolution under Accumulative lens tightens options without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Nautilus shell constrains choice (refracting light/vibrating with sorrow) and charges the ending as "compass pointing home," elevating micro-setting beyond atmospheric postcard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency when whispered truth makes "density of presence" crushing; vial failure forces trade-off (artificial light vs. shared warmth) with felt cost in tears and capped sun.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically via "revalue" reframing—no moralizing, but final shell-as-compass image resonates non-literally with conceptual cost of choosing presence over preservation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("logarithmic curve," "pocket-suns") modulates under stress; rhythm shifts from precise to fragmented as Kael whispers, avoiding dialogue convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "tears tracked through dust on Kael's cheeks" but slight overwriting risk in opening’s "ember nexus, twilight bleeding" barely avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</comment><comment>Transforms "dying friend" trope through scientific romance lens—shell’s logarithmic curve mirroring caldera collapse creates fresh emotional calculus without gimmickry.</comment>
