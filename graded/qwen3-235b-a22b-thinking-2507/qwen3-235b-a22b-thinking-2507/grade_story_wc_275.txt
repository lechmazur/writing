<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pacifist contradiction drives earned endurance; embodied fear ("hand flew to sheath") vs. quiet resolve crystallizes in kneeling. Raiders lack depth but single-POV focus holds. Father's legacy motivates without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: sandbag settling "like protective shroud" reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost (safety for principles). Orientation flawless by word 30; Accumulative lens holds through density escalation to resonant hush.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Glass dome and desert roses constrain choice—sandbag shields seedlings from wind/gunfire. Micro-setting charges finale: "roses glowing like embers" embodies theme. Sensory details purposeful ("velvety petal," "gritty weight"), no tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (peace vs. survival) tightens through agency: sheathing dagger narrows options to nurturing defiance. Cost legible in raiders' hesitation—vulnerability becomes tactical strength under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "roses remember quiet" shown via sandbag ritual, not stated. Final image reweights "quiet" from engraved plea to living defiance without moralizing. Complexity in legacy—no redemption, only acknowledgment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: notices "minute shift in leaf’s angle," voice modulates from lyrical ("tranquil blaze") to staccato ("Three figures emerged"). Zero filter verbs; rhythm crystallizes pressure in "soft *snick* louder than any shout."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold—"tranquil blaze" evolves meaning without redundancy. Peak beats ("she sheathed the dagger") have surgical rhythm. Final line ("living weave against chaos") crystallizes theme with zero overwriting. Prose propulsion flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Engraved quiet" as physical object transforming meaning is brilliant synthesis. Avoids tropes: victory through vulnerability, raiders bewildered not evil. Emotional specificity in pacifism as active "weaving," not passive safety.</comment>
