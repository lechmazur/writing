<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "vulnerability a cold stone" versus "yielding that birthed constellations," with embodied grief ("heart like shattered glass") driving micro-choices during the storm. Slight deduction for backstory summary exceeding BRR limits without altering tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "vulnerability wasn’t a flaw but the vessel" crystallizes stance with visceral cost (his frail hands as strength). Accumulative lens holds through star-dust motif, though storm onset edges toward coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Yellow glass and chronometers function as micro-setting that constrains choices—Silas uses his body as buffer against brass instruments, with star-dust on knuckles charging the final image. Observatory isn't backdrop but active pressure during the storm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake ("find strength in vulnerability") tightens when storm forces Silas to choose stillness over flight, with cost legible in "frail hands" becoming the vessel. Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens, though storm’s arrival lacks causal buildup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "broken things channel light" reweights yellow glass’s function without moralizing. Final image of star-dust as "captured constellations" offers resonant answer to grief’s dissolution, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "motes that were not dust but cooled ash of dead stars," with rhythm modulating under pressure (short sentences during storm). "Spiritually curious" slightly edges toward label-speak but saved by concrete embodiment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose sings with "honeyed light softening the telescope’s harsh glare," but paraphrase loop ("vulnerability a cold stone... vulnerability wasn’t a flaw") and minor scaffold in reflection paragraph prevent 9.0. Zero artifacts near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope through astronomer-janitor lens; "flourishing stillness" as active tactic during storm feels fresh. Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off, though "primal elegance" risks abstraction but is anchored by knuckles glittering with star-dust.</comment>
