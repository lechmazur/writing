<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "geography of loss" embodiment but "empty chair/unsent letters" risks label-only grief; micro-choices (solder burns, weeping ignition) earn closure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost ("raw solace of purpose reclaimed"), but cryptic phone calls stretch accumulative logic; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through moon-phase pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Censer foot as micro-setting constrains every choice—from salvaged relic to tear-ignited beacon—and charges the final image ("beacons" reweighting stars); sensory specificity ("verdigris surface cool against palm") avoids symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via censer’s fading pulse (visible cost), but protagonist agency diluted by phone instructions; escalation driven by moon’s waning creates unavoidable trade-offs between time and grief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "geography of loss made passable," avoiding moralizing; final image ("stars didn’t feel like wounds") reweights grief without stating a moral, charged by prior particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("hands cobbled from mismatched skin grafts") and rhythmic control under pressure; "geography of loss" repetition slightly undermines voice cohesion in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but "geography of loss" phrase appears 3x creating minor synonym churn; propulsion flawless with "sweat stinging eyes" compressing tension into visceral detail.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief and navigation via concrete details (patina bronze, sandalwood smoke); transforms tropes through irreplaceable mechanics where loss becomes actionable terrain.</comment>
