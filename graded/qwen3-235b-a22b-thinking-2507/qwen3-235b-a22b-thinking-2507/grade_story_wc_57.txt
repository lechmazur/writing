<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority avoids labels ("numb but steady hands"), contradictions manifest in patience/urgency tension, and final choice (tying rope to tin) earns cost through time pressure. Flaw: time pressure lacks sufficient struggle to fully test his patience trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost ("weight of time," urgency beneath calm) under Accumulative/Textural lens. Fog-thickening-to-lifting cadence shift reweights preservation stakes. No orientation debt; lens clarity impeccable from "oceanic hush" opening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frost-stiffened rope constrains decoding tactics, while fulgurite glass charges final image as "fossilized storm." Sensory selection masterful: "creak of ice sounded distant" narrows perception to Elias's focused state. Snow erasing footprints but not patterns embodies theme physically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vanishing knowledge) tightens when spiral knot reveals "deep-rooted endurance," foreclosing ignorance path. Cost ("weight of time") legible in numbing hands and urgency. Agency-driven escalation flawless, though opposition (time) lacks tangible resistance beyond atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through particulars: rope knots as encoded wisdom, seeds as living memory. Final image (rope tied to tin) reweights "patience as loom" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; mentor's quote integrated as causal cue for decoding, not abstract sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: notices rope's "subtle frays," fulgurite's "jagged edges." Rhythm modulates from fog's "slow, breathing tide" to urgent "sudden warmth." Zero head-hopping; compression in reflection taught early via tactile cues ("gloved finger tracing knots").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fog rolled like slow, breathing tide" does triple duty. Figurative language sparse yet potent ("fossilized storm holding back dark"). Final line’s "rope and root and glass" recharges opening’s "golden dock" with crystalline clarity. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis: rope knots as agricultural almanac avoids trope through specific patterns (crown sinnett, half-hitches). Emotional truth in "coaxing meaning forward like drawing shy creature." Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; transformation test passed via seed revival logic.</comment>
