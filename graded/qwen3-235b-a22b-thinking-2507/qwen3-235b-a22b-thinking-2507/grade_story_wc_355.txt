<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s pacifist motivation is embodied through mending instruments and silence cataloging, but her epiphany lacks contradictory impulses in the climax—trading "theatrical sincerity" for quiet understanding feels earned yet slightly tidy without deeper internal friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with "the silence of being seen across time," and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds; minor escalation dip as tuning forks progress feels methodical rather than intensifying stakes under pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The workshop’s brass tools and rosin-dusted fingers constrain choices (e.g., fork selection) and charge the final image—stepping outside to hear "deeper silence beneath" fireworks—elevating setting beyond atmosphere into active thematic engine.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via the fireworks deadline and clasp’s resistance, with Elara’s agency driving escalation through fork trials; the visceral cost of "weight of what she’d recover" is unmistakable, though the single reversal lacks deeper tactical adaptation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete silences ("withheld forgiveness," "shared grief") rather than moralizing; the diary’s final line reweights prior material into a resonant answer—"space where you finally hear the other’s breath"—without stated morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in silence cataloging, with rhythmic control modulating from precise ("A-natural, 432Hz") to lyrical ("velvet" silence); no head-hopping, though minor register drift in "theatrical sincerity" slightly dilutes pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion prevail, but "silence so thick it pressed against her eardrums like velvet" risks mixed metaphor, and thematic labels ("silence of fleeting courage") verge on scaffold without sufficient embodied cost in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of harmonic resonance as empathy mechanics avoids tropes; specificity in "frequency lock" and silence taxonomy transforms generic legacy quest into emotionally precise risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
