<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s throat tightening at "beauty in decay" while ritualizing loss; micro-choice to scatter ash as rebellion against oblivion earns closure with felt cost of accepting impermanence. No stock phrasing—embodied emotion rooted in porcelain mask’s weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: ash settling into vanishing point crystallizes reconfigured stakes (love persists in dissolution) with conceptual cost of shattered safety mirage. Accumulative lens holds—rocking chair’s halt and ash swirl tighten pressure without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vanishing point perspective charges final image: ash spiraling toward convergence reweights dissolution as beauty. Porcelain mask constrains choice (shield against mirage) and charges closure when Elara feels its weight stepping into light—environment-as-setting meets 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defying oblivion via fleeting emotion) tightens through ash’s swirling "ghostly embrace," forcing crystallization of Eleanor’s hope. Cost legible in mask’s heaviness—Elara’s endurance forecloses preservation, reconfiguring safety as transient truth under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through ash’s fading pattern: "fragile safety it pretended to offer" reweights prior material without moralizing. Final image (mask’s sharp edges) answers central question—broken things hold meaning—avoiding thematic echo despite "mirage" repetition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "charcoal portrait ash scatterer" lexicon; rhythmic control peaks as ash swirls "like ghostly embrace." Zero head-hopping—POV modulates from "jagged edges" to "uncertain light" with pressure-appropriate compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "dust motes dancing toward vanishing point" does triple duty (atmosphere/action/theme). Overwriting risk in "somber marvel" avoided by concrete payoff ("clarity" not despair). Final line’s "uncertain light" recharges ash motif with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "ritual keeper" trope via ash-scattering physics and vanishing point math. Risk-taking (lyric closure) heightens stakes: gallery’s dissolution becomes "somber marvel" without gimmickry. Fresh inflection in porcelain mask as broken-shield metaphor.</comment>
