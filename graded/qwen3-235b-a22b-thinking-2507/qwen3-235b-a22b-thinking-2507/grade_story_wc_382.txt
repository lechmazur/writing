<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation (grief-driven pursuit of fictional architecture language) intensifies credibly; her "interrogation" flaw crystallizes when Mrs. Thorne echoes Vale’s critique, making the earned shift to "shared fiction" feel inevitable with visible cost in her stiffening reaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully: Vale’s letter ("Guard the silence between the lies") reweights the entire premise under Accumulative/Textural lens, with the felt cost of Elara’s shifted worldview crystallized in "pretending the stones conversed built bridges across loneliness."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The obsidian seal functions as micro-setting, constraining choice through tactile memory ("edges with a patiently nimble touch") and charging the final image ("pressed the seal to her chest"), while sensory details like "jasmine and damp earth" reflect Elara’s grief-filtered urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation via protagonist agency: Elara’s sharp question ("Did he ever doubt the language?") forces Mrs. Thorne’s thematic revelation, narrowing her options from demanding literal meaning to accepting "the looking," with the cost of her interrogative approach made legible in her stiffening and burning eyes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—Vale’s "Dorian mode" lie and the seal’s transformation—not abstraction; the final image ("architecture seemed to breathe") offers a resonant answer to "language of buildings" by reweighting "agreed upon lies" as emotional sanctuary without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elara’s grief focuses on tactile/architectural details ("cracked ivory," "weathered stones"), with rhythmic control shifting from reflective cadence to epiphany’s urgency ("Suddenly, she understood"), though Mrs. Thorne’s dialogue slightly converges lexically under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("meteors streaked silver across the velvet sky" weaves setting/emotion), but "velvet sky" edges toward cliché and "breath caught" slightly generic, narrowly avoiding Q7 deductions in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "grief comfort" trope through specific architecture-language metaphor; the "agreed upon lies" concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with meteor shower and seal synthesizing emotional truth into a fresh, non-obvious angle on collective meaning-making.</comment>
