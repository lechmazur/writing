<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but contradictory impulses under pressure lack scene demonstration; "stillness wasn’t emptiness but a vessel" risks diagnostic label-speak despite embodied setup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure lands with felt cost (earthbound transformation), but accumulative lens lacks persistent constraint visibly shaping tactics beyond initial spine mention.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grotto functions as micro-setting: saltwater drips and damp walls directly constrain polishing technique and charge final image with environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen credibly through village fear, but escalation relies on atmospheric accumulation rather than protagonist agency tightening options under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sea glass transformation; final image reweights "earthbound" with conceptual cost, though "pearl of stillness" borders on thematic echo in closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("mist curling like phantom breath"), but "reflectively vibrant" repetition creates rhythmic tic undermining pressure modulation in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Reflectively vibrant" scaffold appears 3x in critical beats as label-only ornament; otherwise exquisite density with zero momentum drag in closure sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of star-watching and sea glass avoids tropes through tactile craft, though "earthbound star watcher" risks sounding like a pre-packaged archetype.</comment>
