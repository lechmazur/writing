<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (solitude vs. duty) manifest in micro-choices like lateral pacing and coded message revision; final endurance of risk feels earned through embodied stakes ("pulse quickened," unlocked gate) without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through courtyard's evolving resonance; Earned Stasis closure lands with palpable cost ("weight of a choice") as the unlocked gate crystallizes her shifted integrity—no causality breaks in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Courtyard mosaic path actively constrains problem-solving (lateral pacing), while the anemometer and gate transform from tools to thematic anchors; final "unlocked gate" charges setting with irreversible consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (integrity vs. quarantine survival) tightens through protagonist agency: indigo dye recognition forces coded reply, with visible cost in vulnerability ("risked expulsion") driving the closure shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly via "integrity thrived not in isolation but in courage to act unseen," reweighted by the unlocked gate—a resonant, non-literal answer avoiding moralizing while embracing solitude's complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in storm-observer details ("anomalous pressure drop"); rhythm modulates under stress ("Who sent it? And why to her?") with zero POV leaks or filter verbs in pivotal beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "brass cool under her fingers" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor deduction for "credibly curious" abstraction in high-pressure beat, but prose propulsion remains impeccable through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms quarantine tropes through meteorological lens; "progressing laterally" as problem-solving method feels organic. Risk-taking (quiet climax over action) heightens stakes without gimmickry, synthesizing solitude and duty uniquely.</comment>
