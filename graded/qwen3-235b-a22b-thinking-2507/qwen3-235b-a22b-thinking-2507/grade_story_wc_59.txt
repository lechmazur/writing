<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear motivation but lacks contradictory impulses; "bitterly sweet truth" labels emotion without embodied cost, triggering Q1 diagnostic penalty. Final choice lacks micro-choice hierarchy under pressure despite strong interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("beauty born of fracture"), but causal ambiguity in escalation (machine activation relies on coincidence, not agency). Orientation clear by 100 words; lens (Accumulative) held through closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Suspended palace tremors constrain choices (egg handling during quakes), charging final image. Micro-setting (egg/moss) directly alters tactics. Sensory specificity ("ticking wound," "ozone tang") avoids cliché while reflecting urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reviving beauty) tightens via machine activation, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the hatching feels coincidental, not earned through choices. Cost ("flawed genesis") stated but not viscerally felt through action until final lines.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "flawed genesis" motif without moralizing, but "bitterly sweet truth" risks thematic echo. Final image reweights beauty as persistence, though "fracture" repetition slightly overstates the concept near closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ticking wound," "fossilized potential") modulates under stress. Rhythmic control peaks in hatching sequence, though "bitterly sweet" repetition creates subtle register drift in climax beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffolding, but "bitterly sweet tang" paraphrase loop in climax beat triggers Q7 penalty. Filter verbs ("he felt") cluster during high-pressure hatching, dulling immediacy without pattern justification.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms "extinct creature revival" trope through mechanical-world specificity and imperfect outcome. Emotional truth in broken beauty avoids sentimentality, though "flawed genesis" framing edges toward familiar thematic territory.</comment>
