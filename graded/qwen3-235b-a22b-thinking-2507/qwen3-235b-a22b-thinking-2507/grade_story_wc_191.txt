<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction under pressure is implied but not simultaneous; micro-choices like coaxing paint show embodied decision-making, yet the "wisely adventurous" trait lacks competing impulses in climactic moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: throne remains unclaimed but Elara's dissolution of the ruby flake into the throne's fabric crystallizes cost through tangible sacrifice, with dawn's arrival sealing irreversible change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard functions as micro-setting: waterfall's refracted light enables the mural revelation, and roots physically guide the stairway discovery, charging the final image with "moss-covered plinth" and "Sentinel Oak."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally under time pressure ("dawn's approach"), but the conceptual cost of guardianship ("carrying not a crown but a story") feels slightly abstract versus visceral; sunrise deadline effectively narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: throne's emptiness and ruby flake's rebirth reweight "unclaimed" as active stewardship, avoiding moralizing while resonating via "mend their future" without stating the moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "ozone—futuristic nostalgia" and "moss as soft as ancient memory," but stress-induced compression falters during stairway descent where "air grew cooler" lacks character-particular sensory filtering.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "wisely adventurous, she’d studied..." dilutes immediacy; otherwise, zero loops with high density—"dissolved into a cascade of light" weaves memory into physical action without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synthesizes "chosen one" trope through lore-keeper specificity: throne demands a "witness," not ruler, transforming conquest into cyclical stewardship with the reborn ruby flake's quiet promise.</comment>
