<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (forging vs preserving) drives micro-choices under pressure; "trust wasn’t about certainty" risks therapy-speak near climax but embodied cost in trembling hands secures motivation. Final release of Hermes earns endurance with visible chest-weight shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Hermes’ departure crystallizes stance with felt cost ("weight lifted"), under Accumulative/Textural lens. Dust motes’ final settlement reweights stakes without stating moral; orientation clear by 90 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (dust motes/skylight) constrains choice and charges closure: practice method directly enables success, with final image ("dust settling on silent pages") recharging sonic preservation theme through tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: dust-mote practice builds to critical Hermes decision, narrowing options (trust pigeon or fail preservation). Cost legible in "betrayal echoing past forgeries" and chest-weight imagery during transfer.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sonic imprints/dust motes without moralizing; final image ("songs lived in careful hands") reweights "paper trails" as active preservation, avoiding sentimentality. No thematic echo despite high conceptual density.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "dust motes’ chaotic paths" and paper scent details; voice modulates from tense precision ("one wrong move") to lyrical calm. Slight register drift in "trust wasn’t about certainty" but compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Blooming scent... tone both vibrant and fading" creates mixed metaphor in high-pressure beat, violating coherence checks. Otherwise strong propulsion; scaffold minimal but artifact in critical moment blocks 9.0 eligibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic archaeology with moral reckoning; meteorite chips transform "paper trails" trope. Risk-taking (dust-mote balance method) heightens stakes coherently, though pigeon courier device edges toward convention.</comment>
