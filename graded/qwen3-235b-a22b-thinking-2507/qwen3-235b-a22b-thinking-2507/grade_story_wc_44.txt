<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-driven motivation is embodied in micro-choices (chisel work, lens adjustment), but internal contradiction lacks depth; simultaneous impulses like fear of failure versus duty aren’t dramatized under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands perfectly: shadows streaming downward reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost (Varn as guardian), and the causal lens holds through the orrery’s repair sequence to the shadow-shard’s revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The clockwork key and brass orrery function as micro-setting, constraining choices (calibrated tension for resealed runes) and charging the final image (key beside the shadow-shard), elevating beyond atmospheric description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is causal and driven by agency: each repaired loop narrows options toward the noon-shadow revelation, with the shadow-shard crystallizing the felt cost of Varn’s sacrifice as the dominant stake tightens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action—the shadow-shard’s "cool and solid" presence reweights "shadows go within" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo while delivering earned resonance via the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("calloused thumb," "scratch of her tool") reflects Elara’s scholarly focus; rhythmic control under pressure (shortened sentences during repair) avoids head-hopping with zero POV drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "resonant *click*" and "shimmering map" exemplify high-density propulsion with tactile specificity, while the shadow-shard’s physicality avoids figurative muddle in the peak closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through grounded choices: "spoon-bending" warps foreshadow planetary stakes, and Varn’s fate as guardian reweights "sealed awakenings" into a non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable.</comment>
