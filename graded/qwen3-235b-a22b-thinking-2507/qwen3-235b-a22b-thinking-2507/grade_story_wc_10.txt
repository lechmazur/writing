<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Elara's frustration tightening her throat yet persisting with the resonator; the botanist's thermal shift (crimson to gold) embodies earned cost through visible tears, avoiding diagnostic labels. Micro-choices like miming gestures reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: the botanist's tear-carved cheeks and golden aura harmonizing with lilies' blue reconfigure silence's meaning under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors by 100 words, and cost proof ("tears carving paths") is concrete.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The tuning fork case (tool) constrains choices across beats—salvaged relic to resonator holder—and charges the final image as "empty of metal but full of purpose." Winterglass micro-setting directly enables the thermal solution, with lilies' blue heat driving the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens deepens via protagonist agency: distorted thermal data (anger where mourning expected) forces Elara to seek lilies' steadiness, narrowing options to the resonator. Botanist's tears and Elara's first smile since the shipwreck manifest unmistakable cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars—"silence's depth," "thermal grace notes"—with the final image ("warmth wrote symphonies") offering a resonant answer to translating grief. Avoids moralizing; complexity in "grief and grace spoke through thermal grace notes" lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: thermal imagery ("feverish crimson halo," "liquid moonlight") filters all observation. Rhythmic control shifts from clipped stress ("Frustration tightened her throat") to flowing breakthrough ("hands flew over her stave paper"), with lyric compression taught early via "breath a silent plume."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythmically ("She’d rigged... but data swirled chaotically" vs. "tears carving paths"). Figurative language stays precise and sparse ("palms upturned like frozen wings"), avoiding muddle even in peak beats like the resonator's "gentle thrum."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms deafness into thermal music through specific logic (lilies' steady blue = cello drone). Risk-taking heightens stakes: "silence's depth" redefines marvels as unshaken yet singing, with glacial lilies' resilience avoiding derivative tropes. Transformation test fails—swap names and the emotional core collapses.</comment>
