<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in "here and gone" tension; embodied emotion via wood grain tracing and tear during carving. No diagnostic label-speak despite grief theme. Micro-choice to carve despite weight of absence earns endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "grief could be contained" crystallizes options with felt cost (unfinished carving). Accumulative lens holds throughout; rain/kettle/steam pattern intensifies pressure without causal turns. Cost legible in "love reshaped by absence, not erased".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ash wood grain constrains choices (shaping sorrow) and charges final image (Elias's presence in grain). Rain-beaded skylight evolves from "liquid pearls" to "lullaby", affecting perception. Micro-setting (steam fogging glass) slows time during memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (containing grief) tightens through carving act. Pressure grows via Accumulative lens: sensory density (sawdust/lion musk) deepens as kettle steam blurs time. Cost visible in "rough but undeniably alive" carving and tear during first cut.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ash wood's transformation ("raw wood becoming art"), not statement. Final image reweights "here and gone" concept without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality via "rust-hued peace" defined as "presence of understanding", not pain absence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature evident: wood grain read as life history, rain as "liquid pearls". Rhythm modulates with stress (short sentences during carving). No head-hopping; psychic distance shrinks during memory ("Elias's scarred hands guiding hers").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Rust-hued peace" repeats 3x with identical phrasing (loop). Near-purple prose in "prism holding light and memory" slightly muddles peak beat. Otherwise strong propulsion: "shavings curled away like memories" merges action/image. Final line avoids overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Transforms widow trope via lion tamer specificity and ash wood's dual nature ("hauntingly practical"). Fresh inflection: grief as "storm contained" through carving. Avoids abstraction via sawdust/musk sensory details. Risk in lyric structure pays off through Charged Poise closure.</comment>
