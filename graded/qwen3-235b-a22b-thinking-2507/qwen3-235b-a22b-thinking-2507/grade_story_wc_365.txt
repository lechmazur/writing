<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("betrayal or sacrifice") manifests in embodied choices: shard biting palm during sensory overload, fist-closing as commitment. Final renunciation of redirecting the truth earns cost through prior causality—Lyra's "Don't follow" vision crystallizes stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with undeniable cost: "weight... settled on her shoulders" reconfigures sacrifice as gravity, not stone. Accumulative lens holds—density peaks during implosion vision, with coolant viscosity and klaxons tightening sensory pressure into crystallized understanding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting (shard's temperature shifts) constrains choices: cold shard extinguished post-vision forces realization; warming edges become compass. Final image ("hummed with purpose") charges the bay's desolation, making environment inseparable from thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes (truth's weight) tighten through sensory escalation: hydraulic arm near-miss proves kinetic bleed, then Lyra's sacrifice reweights "crushing pressure" into resonant gravity. Cost is unmistakable—"voluntary surrender" felt in "bone-jarring" physicality and insubstantial ghosthood.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete sensory shifts: "crushing pressure" becomes "resonant gravity," with final "fragile tapestry" reweighting sacrifice as purpose. Avoids moralizing; Lyra's silent implosion answers "betrayal or sacrifice" through visceral cost, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("reading like braille," "humming with residual chroniton decay") filters all detail through Elara's sensory mapping. Rhythm fractures during implosion ("no explosion, only... implosion")—compression under pressure taught early via "kaleidoscope of overlapping sensations."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; "kaleidoscope" phrase risks slight overwriting in high-pressure beat but paid off by later coolant/steam sensory layering. Final line ("fragile tapestry") avoids sentimentality through tactile specificity—"murmur of dreams" recharged by bay's hum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "sister sacrifice" trope via sensory physics: "weaving as perception" grounds emotional truth in visceral details (jasmine soap cutting through rust). Risk-taking (dimensional bleed as emotional metaphor) heightens stakes without gimmickry, cohering through shard's evolving role.</comment>
