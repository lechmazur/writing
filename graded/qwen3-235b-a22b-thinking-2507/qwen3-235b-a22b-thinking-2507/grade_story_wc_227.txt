<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("doubted her hands" vs charm's pulse) drives micro-choices; embodied emotion ("fingers closing," "slick with condensation") avoids therapy-speak. Final renunciation of survival for meaning is earned through tactile kintsugi focus under rising acid.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is Charged Poise: the mended statue's glow reconfigures meaning as "the act of mending itself" against dissolving workshop. Cost is visceral (beam shearing, green vapor) but simultaneous collapse/mending slightly blurs causal pressure at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The acid sea actively consumes the hull ("molecule by molecule"), constraining time and charging the final image where Elara touches golden seams as tide takes her. Workshop's failing gears dictate her physical choices (e.g., tilting floor forcing precise alignment).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake (mending for meaning vs oblivion) tightens via workshop collapse (beam shearing, green vapor). Agency shines in pockmark alignment under pressure, but acid surge coinciding with statue completion slightly softens causality of the cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through action: "golden seams holding broken things together" voiced by the statue, not Elara. Final image (touching seam as tide takes her) reweights "conjure meaning" into earned endurance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("pockmarks like forgotten stars," "symphony of straining brass") filters all detail through alchemist's tactile focus. Rhythm accelerates during collapse ("green vapor billowed, stinging her eyes") without syntax collapse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in "ghostly warmth against pervasive chill" slightly dilutes high-pressure beat. Otherwise clean propulsion: "jolt, like static shock mixed with sorrow" compresses sensation without scaffold. No loops in critical mending sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kintsugi philosophy transformed through acid-sea specificity: "pockmarks" as alignment points, gold lacquer tracing fractures. Risk-taking (quiet ending where oblivion wins but meaning persists) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
