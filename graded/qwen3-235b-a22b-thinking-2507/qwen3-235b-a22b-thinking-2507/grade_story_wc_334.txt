<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (decades of seeking theft vs. gentle preservation) earns closure, but "crisp nostalgia" label risks abstraction; embodied micro-choices like the trembling glove press strengthen authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: refusal of victimhood ("robbed" to "guardian") carries cost in tears and "weight of forgiveness"; lens holds as Accumulative/Textural with constellation density reweighting stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Flooded greenhouse constrains every choice (sextant angles, sediment clouds) and charges final ascent; shipwrecks evolve from "broken teeth" to "sentinel," directly shaping the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Aris’s shifting understanding ("stolen" to "preserved"), but escalation lacks a meaningful tightening beat; the single deepening turn (mushroom touch) reweights knowledge without narrowing options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through fungal network as memory vault, not moralizing; final image ("air of a world where habits might yet mend") reweights "ghosts fester in the cracks" with conceptual cost of forgiveness, avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: folklorist’s selective noticing ("salt-crusted goggles," "phosphorescent algae") filters setting; rhythmic control modulates under pressure ("constellations should have been visible—but the flood had fractured...").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-loop in "ghosts fester in the cracks" and "crisp nostalgia" slightly dulls momentum; otherwise, high density ("iron ribs coiled like a serpent’s spine") and visceral propulsion anchor every sentence without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folklorist methodology with ecological grief; "fairy ring as memory vault" transforms trope through specific causality (star alignments triggering recall), avoiding derivative safety-middle choices.</comment>
