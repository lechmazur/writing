<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: tactile mastery vs human limitation embodied in the slip that fractures the mirror. Exhaustion tremor as authentic flaw compounds stakes without therapy-speak. Final endurance choice (feeling the tree's shudder) forecloses preservation path with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands decisively: flawed mirror reweights sky's "containment" into "honoring," with demolition's rumble as felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure tightens via sensory density (moonlight, coin ridges) not causal turns. Cost proof: "the sky’s vastness could not be truly contained" crystallizes irrevocable loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tree trunk library functions as micro-setting: bark texture guides Elara's touch, hollowed shelves supply silver foil, and demolition pressure originates from its physicality. Final image (hands on rough bark during shudder) charges closure through environment-as-tool. Sensory hierarchy masterful—sight suppressed, touch/vibration prioritized under urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (preserve sky-mirror before dawn) escalates through Accumulative lens: exhaustion narrows options from precise replication to accepting flawed tribute. Cost crystallizes when slip dissolves stars—visible tradeoff between human endurance and cosmic scale. Machinery rumble makes forfeiture undeniable without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete failure: "mirrored not the sky, but the act of seeking within the limit" reweights preservation as honoring impermanence. Zero moralizing—resonance via liquid mercury dissolving into "meaningless, swirling silver." Final image answers central question through embodied acceptance, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless: prose mirrors tactile POV ("fingertips reading grooves," "felt the world in layers sight ignored"). Rhythmic control under pressure—short sentences during slip ("A soft click echoed"), lyrical flow during application. Zero head-hopping; exhaustion subtly compresses diction near climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere or stakes ("hush just before demolition" tightens time pressure). "Fractally precise replication" avoids jargon through concrete action (stylus "no thicker than a hair"). Final line’s "rough bark" reprise delivers closure with textural specificity—no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "doomed library" trope via face-blind artist’s tactile craft: fractal precision as both solution and limitation feels organic, not checklist. Emotional truth in flawed attempt outweighs surface novelty. Risk-taking (textural accumulation over causal plot) heightens stakes coherently—sky’s dissolution unavoidable yet profound.</comment>
