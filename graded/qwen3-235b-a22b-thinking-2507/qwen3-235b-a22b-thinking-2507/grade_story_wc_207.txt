<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("measurable wonder" vs surrender) intensifies to compel higher-stakes choice (leaving instruments), but childhood motivation lacks embodied micro-choice showing its grip during the rappel.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: instruments abandoned, petrichor transformed from chemical to language, and the lagoon's impossible physics reconfigures meaning without tidy resolution at the tunnel threshold.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The lagoon actively constrains choice (water that doesn't ripple, capillary water glow) and charges the final image—its surface reflecting "stars she knew weren’t in this cavern" as Elara steps into the abyssal tunnel.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through deepening (psychometry readings escalating to "explanations dissolved") under Accumulative lens; cost is legible when instruments are left behind, foreclosing scientific documentation for surrender.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: petrichor shifts from "geosmin" to "memory of the world before explanations" via the lagoon’s touch, rejecting moralizing while offering resonant, non-literal answer through the final step into dark.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sensibly eccentric attire," mineral dampness) modulates with pressure; rhythmic control in "hinged awakenings" sequence teaches pattern and pays off in the tunnel’s "liquid shadow" without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "resonant hush" motif deepens meaning without redundancy, though "hinged awakenings" borders on thematic echo in psychometry beat, narrowly avoiding penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scientific rigor and mystical surrender transforms tropes; "petrichor as language" reweights the premise through specific, verifiable detail (geosmin, capillary water glow) rather than abstraction.</comment>
