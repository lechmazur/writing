<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (analytical mind vs. embodied grief), but "fault-tolerant lattice" verges on diagnostic label-speak; micro-choice of smudging the illustration powerfully reveals values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise is flawless: auroral light deepening as she accepts grief’s integration carries undeniable conceptual cost; Accumulative lens holds through density increase in the smudge’s reconfiguration of meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mountain station functions as vital micro-setting—the scale constrains her choice, ice sensors charge the climax; "thin air" repetition slightly dilutes specificity but final image (smudged paper in auroral light) meets 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens is masterful: smudge irreversibly deepens the dominant stake (quantifying guilt), narrowing options to acceptance; cost ("space it occupied within her margins") is visceral and legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action—smudge as distortion of memory reweights "swaying certainties" without moralizing; final image answers central question through concrete particulars, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exceptional (oracle mind noticing contradictions, measuring tremors); rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure, though "fault-tolerant" framing risks clinical detachment but stays character-rooted.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but "swaying certainties" repetition (3x) and slight paraphrase loop in fever description ("shivering...hollow ache"/"weight of truth") incur minor momentum drag in mid-scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via meteorological lens: "fault-tolerant oracle" isn’t gimmick but drives closure logic; every detail serves the central metaphor with emotional specificity that avoids generic templates.</comment>
