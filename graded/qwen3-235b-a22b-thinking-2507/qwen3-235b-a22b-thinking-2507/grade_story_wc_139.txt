<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's interior contradiction—craving fairness while inheriting con-artist brilliance—drives her calculus authentically. Silas remains off-page, weakening the relationship crucible; his "moral rot" feels asserted, not embodied through active friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: Reynolds' "it must be airtight" concession crystallizes precarious hope amid "chill of the dead." Accumulative lens holds perfectly, but ink's influence on Reynolds edges toward convenient softening without sufficient tactical cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ink pot charges the final image as "silent ambassador," but the funeral home's tools never constrain choices. Prep room atmosphere ("deathly vitality") informs tone yet fails to actively pressure tactics during the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's graph—x-axis "Truth Shared" narrowing options via cognitive deepening. However, Reynolds' shift relies slightly on ink's perceived magic rather than purely earned causality, diluting the felt cost of her "honest calculus."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete math ("one life saved for ten prevented"), avoiding moralizing. Final rain cessation reweights "deathly vitality" as earned resonance, though the "fair trade" concept lacks deeper interrogation of its ethical compromises.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "ink’s viscosity defying gravity" mirrors her tension. Dialogue avoids pitfalls—Reynolds' clipped "Fraud voids protection" carries institutional weight—but "craved tangible fairness" veers toward abstract telling mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "pulse syncing with the clock’s tick" compresses urgency. One paraphrase loop ("waiting actively meant observing... all teaching balance") dilutes momentum in a high-pressure beat, blocking 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fuses embalmer’s perspective with mathematical asylum calculus for fresh ingenuity. Risk-taking elevates stakes, but "liquefies rigid thinking" slightly echoes familiar magic-realism tropes without transformative specificity.</comment>
