<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (failure vs. hope) drive the final choice; "shivering bliss" slightly edges toward label but redeemed by embodied cost ("bone-deep warmth," blurred vision). Motivation rooted in Oracle's vow compels high-stakes action with credible endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: unsnapping the pattern crystallizes options (overlapping dawns) with undeniable cost (transformational "terrifying joy"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds through pattern density, not causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vines as micro-setting constrain choice (tracing negative spaces) and charge the final image (moon-ivy lattice reconfigured). Sensory details selective yet vivid ("frost that never melted," "brittle and forgotten" paper), avoiding tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (salvaging raw possibility) signaled early; escalation driven by Torin's agency as he decodes the program's cipher. Cost unmistakable in the visceral transformation ("soul remembering how to fly") under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "capturing raw, branching potential" reweights the Oracle's vow without moralizing. Final image (luminous shapes of possibility) offers resonant answer to entropy's threat, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (noticing "clinging residue," geometric script) with rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulates from withdrawn ache to "terrifying joy" without head-hopping; elision of court backstory taught via orchard dust.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; peak beats avoid overwriting ("three precise turns counterclockwise" crystallizes action). Figurative language purposeful ("sound like tearing silk" ties to marionette motif), no muddle in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: marionette patterns as key to possibility transforms tropes. Emotional specificity in Torin's weary hope avoids generic templates; risk-taking (quiet climax) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
