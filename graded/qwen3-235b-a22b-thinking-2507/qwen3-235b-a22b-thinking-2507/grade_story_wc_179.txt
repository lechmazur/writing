<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in Elara's "scheming pacifism" manifests through concrete micro-choices (timing the pin's alignment), but Kael's transformation leans on magical cellular memory rather than organic internal conflict. "Prison you built from smoke" triggers diagnostic label penalty in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: reality shifts intensify pressure without causal breaks. Charged Poise closure lands unmistakably with Kael's shuddering breath carrying visible cost ("resentment out of him like smoke"). Orientation clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sanctuary functions as micro-setting via the music box's vibration through floor, constraining Elara's strategy. But the oaks/stone transitions feel decorative rather than charging the final image; environment doesn't shape tactics beyond the central object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by Elara's agency under Accumulative lens: reality shifts tighten the "live clock" for pin alignment. Cost is visceral in Kael's physical release ("exhaled... resentment like smoke"), reconfiguring their relationship with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids direct moralizing but "prison you built from smoke" edges toward thematic echo. Final image (hand over heart, no words) resonates as non-literal answer about peace being internal, though cellular memory concept slightly over-explains the theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("marble halls utterly mute despite violent tremors") and rhythmic control shine. Peak stress compression ("Kael gasped... triggering cellular memory") avoids filter-verb issues while modulating voice to emotional intensity without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "vibrating not through air but through the floor" exemplifies textural specificity. Figurative language ("resentment flaring like a struck match") is sparse and purposeful in high-pressure beats. Final line crystallizes closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pacifism as "weaponized memory" avoids trope pitfalls. Risk-taking (soundless sanctuary, shifting grace) heightens stakes organically. Transformation test passed: plot wouldn't work with generic "healing object" replacing the broken pin's specificity.</comment>
