<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "hazy precision" methodology versus grief for the engineer; micro-choices like dodging the container show authentic adaptation under pressure without diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost when she touches the patch ("promise to the dead"), crystallizing stakes through wind-pattern legibility; Accumulative/Textural lens holds from "hazy precision" anchor to final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shipping containers function as micro-setting that constrains every move (wind vortices, collapsing hazard) and charges the final image ("haze thinned... empty cranes"), with tools like the anemometer directly shaping tactics during the container collapse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single micro-turn (container collapse) meaningfully tightens stakes by adding structural vulnerability to her report, with visible cost in the near-miss and "patch felt heavier"; agency drives escalation through her recalibration under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "making the invisible visible" reweights wind patterns as moral obligation in the final image without moralizing; avoids thematic echo by embedding insight in her pocketing/touching of the patch.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels via investigator’s precision ("60 knots", "14:03") woven into sensory haze; rhythmic control shifts seamlessly from measured prose during measurements to staccato survival during collapse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dove sideways, anemometer clattering" exemplifies high-density propulsion; metaphors like "wind like a blade" remain physically coherent within the container physics framework.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms accident investigation trope through wind-physics lens; shipping container vortex concept feels fresh yet inevitable, avoiding derivative disaster narratives via specific atmospheric mechanics and emotional weight of the patch.</comment>
