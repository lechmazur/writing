<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Embodied panic ("trembling hand," "muscles coiled to bolt") and contradictory impulses (flight instinct vs. priestess-guided stillness) earn the final choice. Minor deduction for "lonesome splendor" bordering on thematic label in peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: releasing the vial crystallizes options with visible cost ("saltwater stung his eyes," surrendering the artifact). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density shifts (temple's groans fading to distilled quiet).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting (vial as tool/environment) constrains choices—uncorking requires numb fingers amid oxygen depletion—and charges the final image as it tumbles back to the temple, embodying the cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation via sensory deepening: the "snarl" of static resolving into "luminous calm" narrows options under Accumulative pressure. Cost is unmistakable in the physical sacrifice (releasing the vial) and emotional surrender.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (sealing silence into glass), not abstraction. Final image ("silence within him bloom") reweights "harness the ephemeral" without moralizing, avoiding the final-paragraph trap.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: marine urgency filters details ("rebreather hissing final warning"). Rhythmic control under pressure ("Time ran short; the emergency beacon’s erratic pulse...") avoids template cadence despite high stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero figurative muddle in peak beats ("releasing not scent but pure, distilled quiet" does triple duty). Minor scaffold in "memories of priestesses guided his thoughts" slightly dulls immediacy without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "diver in distress" trope via "silence as power" concept. Specificity (crystal perfume vial, not generic artifact) and risk-taking (textural escalation over action) heighten stakes coherently.</comment>
