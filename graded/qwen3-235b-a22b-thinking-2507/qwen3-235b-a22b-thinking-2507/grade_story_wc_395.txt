<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (duty vs obsession) drive micro-choices like lying to Vance; mission patch embodies grief without therapy-speak. Vance's cover-up reveal slightly abrupt but "scoffed at theories" foreshadows it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "consumed but not gone" reweights the archive's nature while Vance's draining color shows visceral consequence. Accumulative lens holds through number pattern intensification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Social network archive actively constrains choices (shredded fragments in 'VOID' partition), while the mission patch charges the final image as "threads frayed from years of worry." Sensory details like "sterile glow" anchor urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's agency: tracing numbers to 'VOID' forces Vance confrontation. Cost crystallizes when numbers stop recurring after truth exposure, showing archive's retaliation. Single meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "consumed but not gone" realization—no moralizing. Final image ("ready to swallow its next victim") resonates with conceptual cost, avoiding false balance by exposing the archive's predatory nature.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "bright attentiveness" shapes noticing data anomalies. Rhythm modulates under pressure ("She slammed enter" vs lyrical "digital echo"). Vance's "Leo..." breath shows distinct voice during climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold; high density with propulsion: "The numbers stopped recurring, as if the archive had noticed its secret was breached." Final line recharges "mission patch" motif without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "archive consumes memories" trope transformed through number-timestamp mechanics. Mission patch evolves from "silent accusation" to symbol of enduring connection, avoiding generic afterlife tropes.</comment>
