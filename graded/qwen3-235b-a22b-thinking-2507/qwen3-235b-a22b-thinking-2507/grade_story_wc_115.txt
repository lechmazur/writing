<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction underdeveloped; skepticism-to-acceptance shift lacks layered irrationality. "Crushing lightness of a lie" triggers diagnostic label penalty in climax. Micro-choices like radio tuning reveal values but emotional progression feels compressed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost: "carrying it felt lighter than the silence before confession." But radio confession functions as coincidence rather than earned causality, weakening escalation under Accumulative lens. Cost proof is legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (valve wheel) constrains choices and charges closure: beads evolve from "dull eyes" to "wetness that wasn't tunnel damp." Sensory details like "cold seepage through jeans" reflect urgency. Environment shapes tactics through radio use and physical strain.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when radio confession transforms valve from curiosity to burden. Agency evident in lifting/dropping/reclaiming the wheel. Cost is visible in physical strain and conceptual shift, though ghost shift arrival leans slightly on coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through valve's evolving weight metaphor without moralizing. Final image ("compass pointing toward absolution") reweights "swallowed truth" non-literally. Avoids thematic echo while embracing complexity of guilt's tangible burden.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "geologist's focus," "tunnel's ancient throat." Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure (static to silence). "Drowsy alertness" slightly abstract but redeemed by concrete cold-fog imagery later.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density with lines like "beads clicking like counting bones" doing triple duty. "Crushing lightness" edges toward therapy-speak but anchored by physical context. Final line recharges motif without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope through valve-as-truth-burden. Fresh synthesis: industrial object embodying moral weight. Risk-taking (radio as conduit) heightens stakes without gimmickry. "Swallowed truth" specificity avoids generic abstraction.</comment>
