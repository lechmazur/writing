<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in silent vow vs. exile cost; "dent in stone" embodies flaw without therapy-speak. Slight deduction for "beauty in the difficulty" insight bordering on over-articulation mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "silent victory" crystallizes stakes with felt cost (tear/dent). Nexus stilling and bird's note reconfigure exile's meaning under Accumulative lens held from paragraph one.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Magnetic nexus constrains every choice (compass spins, shadow adjustment) and charges closure as phase shifts. Worry stone's dent functions as micro-setting, transforming exile's physicality into thematic weight at the end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: correlating shooting star to bishop move forecloses political redemption path. Visible cost (tear, dent) alters tactics toward "offering solution," fulfilling Accumulative escalation with conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from stone's dent and "silent victory," avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights exile as "beauty buried in betrayal" without stating morals, though near-equivalence between king's crime and tutor's silence slightly dilutes complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("twilight bled," "stars sharp and cold") modulates under pressure with rhythmic control. "Thoughtfully precise" label appears twice but earns redemption through concrete actions like shadow adjustment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "correlate" repeats with escalating meaning. "Indifferent stars" avoids cliché through "sharp and cold" specificity. Minor deduction for "beauty in the difficulty" abstraction momentarily dulling closure's texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms exile trope via chess/stars metaphor; "translating silence" synthesizes political and cosmic stakes uniquely. Risk-taking in quiet climax pays off, though magnetic nexus borders on familiar mystical-location trope without deeper transformation.</comment>
