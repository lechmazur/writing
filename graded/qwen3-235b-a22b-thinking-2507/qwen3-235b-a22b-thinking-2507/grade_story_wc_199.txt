<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority strong with "mossy delight" embodiment, but micro-choices under pressure lack contradictory impulses; shift to monument-building feels abrupt without visible internal struggle preceding action despite clear motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with stars revealed and shoots piercing ash (cost legible), but moonstone prod's efficacy relies slightly on convenient folklore mechanics rather than fully dramatized character agency during the pivotal beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Skyborne arbor actively constrains choices (seeds as survival tools) and charges the final image (shoots piercing ash); "moss clinging to decaying beams" mirrors Elara's hope, fulfilling the 9+ gate for environment shaping the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten accumulatively through Hush's palpable silence → leaf cipher → decoded prophecy, with monument-building as the agency-driven climax; cost is viscerally felt in transformed landscape without soft resets.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action (monuments of seeds) and final image; avoids moralizing while reweighting "mossy delight" as active remembrance, delivering a resonant non-literal answer to "how transformation emerges."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("pollen and purpose," "bark grey as old bones") with rhythmic control modulating from lyrical description to urgent action; patterned elision ("liminal moment during the hush") taught early pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; "light flared within the dust speck" avoids filter verbs, though "hope bloomed" risks cliché but is redeemed by botanical context. Final line perfectly recharges "mossy delight" motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms eco-fiction tropes through specific lived detail (ghost-white poppy cairn, sky-orchid spores); emotional truth in quiet ritual preceding action avoids generic templates, making renewal feel inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
