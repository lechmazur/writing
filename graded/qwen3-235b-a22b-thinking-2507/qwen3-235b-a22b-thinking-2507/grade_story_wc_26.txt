<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "preserve hope's shape" vs. accepting its transformation; embodied regret ("settling deep within her bones") avoids therapy-speak. Micro-choice placing the stone reveals value hierarchy, though "softly deliberate" trait lacks sufficient friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal closure lands with undeniable cost: "naive, shared dream of effortless light was gone forever" crystallizes the irreversible trade-off. Because she discovers the shadow's origin, she must metamorphose it—therefore hope becomes a "harder-won, solitary ember" with felt cost on the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting river stone constrains choice (grounding during analysis) and charges closure (warm in palm), satisfying 9+ gate. Library's "airy disorientation" subtly pressures tactics, but stratospheric setting remains atmospheric rather than actively shaping options beyond disorientation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through agency: her analysis reveals the shadow is hope's consequence, forcing the metamorphosis choice. Cost is unmistakable in the "solitary ember" reconfiguration, though escalation relies on intellectual discovery rather than physical pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: hope as "roots in stone" reweights to "solitary ember" without moralizing. Final image answers the central question—"preserve hope's shape" becomes accepting its transformed, harder-won nature—with luminous regret charging the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer's vigilance attuned to subtle shift") and rhythmic control during analysis ("pausing, magnifying") showcase pressure modulation. Zero head-hopping; voice remains anchored in Elara's sensory lexicon even under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sun bled into cloud-sea" demonstrates textural specificity. Minor paraphrase loop in "luminous regret" (used twice) slightly dulls closure impact, but propulsion remains taut with no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms dream-sharing tropes through specific "spectral parchment" and "ink-rooted knowledge," avoiding abstraction. Emotional truth in hope as "quiet persistence" feels inevitable in hindsight, though setting lacks deeper world logic integration for 9.0+.</comment>
