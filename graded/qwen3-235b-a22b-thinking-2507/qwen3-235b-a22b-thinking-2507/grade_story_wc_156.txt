<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses (certainty vs curiosity) act simultaneously in the pivotal pause; her final renunciation of "cage of certainty" is earned by the nickel’s tactile presence and visible cost in abandoning "safety of knowing." Visitor’s thinness slightly weakens relationship crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: abandoning certainty’s "cage" carries conceptual cost legible in "exhilarating unknown" and the nickel’s heartbeat warmth. Minor slip in visitor’s frozen reaction slightly dulls agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sound wave garden actively constrains choices (copper tuning fork for striking nickel) and charges closure ("gardens sang with layered harmonies"). Micro-setting object (hobo nickel) evolves from talisman to key, reweighting the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist’s agency under Accumulative lens: each awakening layer narrows options toward "infinite layers of discovery." Cost is visceral in "thrill of discovery" turning to conceptual surrender, though pressure slightly externalizes during awakenings.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "curiosity is the most vital restoration" earned by struggle, not stated moral. Final image ("work had only just begun") reweights curiosity as ongoing practice with conceptual cost, avoiding Thematic Echo despite quoted line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("methodically playful precision," "luminous threads") modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control elevates the strike sequence, though visitor’s dialogue lacks voice differentiation in the awe moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; "reflected sound waves converged, weaving through the air like luminous threads" multi-jobs propulsion and imagery. Final line crystallizes closure without figurative muddle; "cage of her own certainty" metaphor remains physically coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms restoration trope through sonic imprints; "nested awakenings" feel fresh via specific details (hobo nickel as tuning device). Risk-taking (lyric escalation) heightens stakes without gimmickry, avoiding derivative safety middle.</comment>
