<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through micro-choices (e.g., handling tape "like a sleeping child" while pulse quickens), avoiding epiphanies. Final visibility earned via prior causality—Elara's quiet act forecloses ghostly existence with felt cost in Mrs. Gable's gasp.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: steady lights crystallize the "shared breath" after Elara's invisibility transforms into purposeful connection. Causal lens holds flawlessly—tape discovery directly enables Mrs. Gable's recognition without coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting (pipe chase/tape fragment) constrains choices and charges closure—the spooled reel in archival sleeve on oak table reweights the sapphire hush into "shared breath." Sensory selectivity reflects urgency (e.g., "calloused fingertips" during tension).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when Elara recognizes the tape's significance, narrowing options to visible caching. Cost is legible in her transformed invisibility—agency drives escalation under causal lens, with flickering lights heightening temporal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "Listen." note and Mrs. Gable's trembling fingers reweight visibility as mutual restoration, not self-validation. Final image ("shared breath") avoids moralizing while resolving the central question with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct—Elara notices "grime," "vibrations," and "dust motes" with tactile specificity. Rhythm modulates under pressure (short sentences during discovery), though "kindly methodical" slightly verges on label without sufficient action reinforcement.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density ("dawn bled sapphire" conveys time/mood/stakes) with zero loops. Minor stock phrase ("kindly methodical") slightly dulls propulsion, but final line ("shared breath") crystallizes closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "hidden object" trope through ferromagnetic tape specificity and emotional truth—visibility as mutual restoration avoids sentimentality. Fresh inflection: Elara's redemption hinges on enabling another's voice, not self-validation.</comment>
