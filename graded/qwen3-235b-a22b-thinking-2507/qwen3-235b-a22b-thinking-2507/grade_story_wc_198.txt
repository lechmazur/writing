<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "whisper counterpoint through negative space" choice; embodied emotion in "breathy A" note defines character under pressure. No stock phrasing—flaws manifest as inherited duty's weight, not convenient amnesia.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("dewdrop on the edge of dawn") crystallizes cost via fragility of maintained silence. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: dewdrop formation tightens pressure through density shift, not causal cause-effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism atrium constrains every choice—warped glass dictates light patterns Elias must disrupt. Final image ("soft, unbroken rainbows") charges closure by reversing earlier "shifting coded patterns," proving micro-setting necessity for 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes materialize viscerally as birds' "frantic calls falter" during escalation. Agency drives deepening: Elias' negative-space method actively disrupts harmonic lock, with cost legible in "familiar burden" of preserved peace's transience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through "dewdrop" motif reweighting: final fragility ("transient as the dew") answers prophecy's stakes without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by embedding wisdom in sensory particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels—"fractured beams danced across wet limestone" filters light through Elias' urgent focus. Rhythmic control under pressure: fragmented syntax during dewdrop crisis ("Another note... another void") mirrors his constrained breath.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor synonym loop ("quietly vivid dream"/"quietly vivid and transient") slightly dulls momentum. Otherwise exemplary density: "sculpted from the mist" compresses theme, action, and cost without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms prophecy trope via sonic physics—"negative space" method feels inevitable through prior harmonic details. Risk-taking (silence as weapon) heightens stakes coherently; "eerie nostalgia" gains specificity through saxophone's tactile weight.</comment>
