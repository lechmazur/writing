<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in panic vs vow; embodied emotion in "breathless" emergence and "frantic grip" avoids therapy-speak. Final renunciation of preservation is earned through witnessing transformation, with cost legible in "Eastern Codices were gone." No second character, so relationship bullets irrelevant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "The Eastern Codices were gone" crystallizes the irreversible loss while river's "sigh of acceptance" reconfigures stakes. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure tightens through sensory density shifts (dust→loam, water→nourishment)—with causality intact via swan mechanics. Cost proof solid in codices' absence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Obsidian refuge and origami swan function as micro-settings that constrain choices: refuge enables the critical refolding, swan's altered state directly shapes tactics. River's "murmur" charging the final image ("sigh of acceptance") satisfies 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy—mildew/vellum decay during calm, bioluminescent fungi during crisis—mirrors internal shifts without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elara's agency: panic at collapse → retreat to refuge → deliberate refolding to witness transformation. Dominant stake (witnessing vs preserving) tightens via her choice to burrow "through silence," with visible cost in lost codices. Accumulative lens elevates pressure through pattern break (destruction→rebirth), avoiding causal requirements for this design.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete transformation: "dust becoming fertile loam" and "water seeping... to nourish" reweight "witnessing" as active participation in rebirth. Final image ("ink flowing smooth and dark as the river") offers non-literal answer to "change without judgment" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—wisdom arises solely from observed particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature dominates: vellum's "sweet decay" and shadows as "living things" reflect her fragile state. Rhythmic control peaks in collapse sequence—"stone met parchment... dust becoming fertile loam"—with compression taught early via "burrowed" motion. Zero head-hopping; single POV consistency exemplifies Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "crumbling spine" → "crumbling peace" recurrence charges closure without redundancy. High density: "humming with cryptic folds that mapped unseen pathways" does triple duty (character, object, stakes). Final line's river/ink parallel avoids purple prose through precise textural specificity ("smooth and dark").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "witnessing" as regenerative act—not passive observation but integration into decay/rebirth cycle. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure, Charged Poise closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Derivative elements (catacombs, origami) transformed through specific rules: swan's "altered" state post-burrow, silence as active mending force.</comment>
