<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied choices ("ash whispering from jagged lip," "time thicken—gritty, urgent, alive"), but the elderly seller’s minimal presence limits relationship crucible testing despite strong micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "borrowed time wasn’t a sentence, but a bridge" crystallizes stance with visible cost (continuing dangerous message work), under Accumulative/Textural lens where texture accumulation drives the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Emerald silo functions as micro-setting that constrains every choice (e.g., gear pressed into urn crack using "residual energy"), with sensory details like "green light pulsing like a heartbeat" charging the final image’s "stitch by fragile stitch" cadence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency (urn discovery → encoded ad → toolbox quest), narrowing options to "risky" communication with felt cost in "heart pounding with anticipated mysteries," though secondary pressure remains underdeveloped per scope limits.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "time wasn’t abstract; it had weight, grit" reweights into closure’s "texture of time was patience," avoiding moralizing while offering resonant non-literal answer via silo’s "pulse steady, holding time together."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("seconds became metaphors") modulates rhythm under pressure ("fingers flying" vs. "world froze"), with non-standard grammar ("Hinges hum a lullaby") taught early and paid off in closure’s lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "brittle—cremation urn fragment" demonstrates textural specificity, while "tarnished but solid" ad line achieves high density without muddle, propelling momentum through every sentence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of timekeeping tropes through emotional resonance mechanics ("calendars measured emotional resonance"), with "garage sale encoding" method feeling inevitable in hindsight while heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
