<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (panic vs purpose) drives choices, but Vale's vanishing lacks embodied cost; motivation stays told not tested in micro-choices during climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Situational lens holds: tidal pressure forces stance crystallization. Closure as Charged Poise (keeper of echoes) reweights stakes with felt cost, though codex mechanics feel slightly retroactive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Limestone passage actively constrains movement (shoulders scraping), seawater dictates tactics; "crashing hush" evolves from oppressive to resonant, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Tidal clock relentlessly tightens options; rising water forces Arden’s run with visible cost (abandoned safety), though claustrophobia’s internal conflict doesn’t deepen the external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through cables-as-archives metaphor; final image ("keeper of echoes") offers non-literal answer to remembrance without moralizing, though "unremembered" phrasing borders on abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (spelunker’s tactile urgency); controlled compression under stress; "drowned world above" embodies claustrophobia without therapy-speak. No dialogue present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor overwriting ("cathedral of ruin," "ghostly echo") in mid-beat; otherwise clean propulsion. Gold-fleck description avoids synonym churn but edges toward thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of undersea cables as historical archives; specificity (polymer sheaths, phase transitions) grounds sci-fi trope. Risks poetic tone without sacrificing tension or clarity.</comment>
