<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete action ("hands shook with exhaustion") avoids epiphany clichés, but "wryly earnest belief" edges toward abstract label-speak without sufficient embodied cost in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost ("haggard awe, bone-deep weariness") under Accumulative/Textural lens; rain-trail pattern break reweights stakes when she sketches aquifer maps instead of wars.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tidal island functions as micro-setting: causeway access dictated by tides directly constrains her journey, while rain-carved dunes actively guide her to the brooch discovery beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (threshing meaning from trauma) tightens when brooch demands confronting war's roots; cost crystallizes in "haggard awe," though rain's role in discovery slightly undercuts protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Final image of sketching rain trails—not wars—resonantly answers central question through concrete action, avoiding moralizing while charging "slow patient work of rebuilding" with earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("salt-crusted windows," "liquid language") persists under stress; minor register drift in "wryly earnest" momentarily disrupts voice coherence during high-pressure reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("amber glinted beneath surface, unearthed by storm’s insistence") propels momentum, though "wryly earnest" risks overwriting in a pivotal beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of water-war trauma through painter’s lens feels inevitable; tidal causeway as literal/metaphorical bridge transforms familiar "relic discovery" trope with specific hydrological stakes.</comment>
