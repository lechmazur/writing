<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in muscle memory vs calculation tension during fix; embodied exhaustion ("sweat stinged her eyes") avoids therapy-speak. Slight thematic labeling ("watcher's burden" mantra) edges toward stock phrasing but saved by concrete micro-choices like weaving cords through weakened eyelets.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: pressure deepens via density ("flicker" to "hairline fracture") with Earned Stasis closure. Cost crystallizes in "burden was a chain she’d never unclasp" – visible, felt, and conceptual. Radio static setup slightly underutilized but closure image reweights silence as trust’s vessel.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Parachute buckle functions as micro-setting that charges closure – its restored integrity logs "Trust intact." Tool constraints drive action (weaving cords through eyelets), while arbor’s cloud-waves physically sway beneath her, altering tactics. Avoids white-room syndrome through tactile metal and petal-ladder details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency: Sector Seven buckle repair reveals higher stakes (Sector Three fracture), narrowing options to endurance. Moral calculus ("Trust dies in the gap between knowing and doing") sharpens peak choice. Abstract city safety slightly weakens visceral impact, but exhaustion and endless burden provide clear cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "trust a fragile bloom" avoids moralizing. Final image ("silence wasn’t empty—it was the space where trust lived") reweights premise without stating moral. Near-miss: "hearing soundless screams" borders on thematic echo but redeemed by physical cost of hands remembering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "luminous threads," "soundless echo" filter world through Elara’s senses. Rhythmic control excels in high-pressure beats ("Sweat stinged... hands remained inventively precise"). Minor register drift in "attuned mind inventing micro-corrections" during crisis slightly jars established lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong propulsion but synonym churn undermines momentum: "attuned senses/fingers/mind" (para 1,6,10) and triple "soundless echo" create paraphrase loops. Filter-verb stack ("flooded her veins; her fingers danced") in peak beat dulls immediacy – not closure-touching but measurably obscures cause/effect in pressure moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms "guardian" trope into "midwives to trust" with tactile repair work. Emotional specificity in buckle-fixing avoids generic heroics. Risk-taking in quiet closure ("No fanfare") heightens stakes, though "arbor above clouds" setting slightly familiar – redeemed by unique parachute system mechanics.</comment>
