<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses (grief vs. hope) drive her sewing choice with embodied cost: "fingers bled" and path fragility. Interiority avoids therapy-speak via concrete sensory anchors like "tears cutting tracks through canyon dust," fulfilling 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: the path's "vulnerability to wind" juxtaposed against "luminous thread" under Accumulative lens. Pressure tightens via sleepwalker insight deepening the ruin/reverence stake, satisfying cost proof test with "fingers bled" and environmental fragility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Recurring storybook plate and silk threads constrain choices (guiding stitching) and charge the final image—children tracing lines while elders point to orchid shoots. Micro-setting (dust impressions) directly alters tactics, meeting 9+ gate requirement for environment constraining choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elara's agency under Accumulative lens: sleepwalker insight transforms passive observation into sewing action. Cost unmistakable via "vulnerable to wind" path and bleeding fingers, with fragility shaping the final image's resonance per 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "ruin was not the end, but the loom" reframed by orchid shoots as non-literal answer to "can reverence rise from ruin?" Zero moralizing; fisherman's tears show earned complexity without thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("hauntingly optimistic pull," "orchid solace" as embodied tone) with rhythmic control under pressure. Cadence shifts from lyrical dawn ("tide pools emptying like spent tears") to urgent sewing beats ("Each knot was a prayer"), taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in lines like "stitching the remembered path with vibrant threads" (action/theme/setting). Figurative language precise ("loom upon which reverence could be rewoven") with no muddle in peak beats, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "mending" trope via wharf weaver's net-silk path and sleepwalkers' unconscious geometry. Emotional truth in "orchid solace" avoids abstraction; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscurity per 9+ quick test.</comment>
