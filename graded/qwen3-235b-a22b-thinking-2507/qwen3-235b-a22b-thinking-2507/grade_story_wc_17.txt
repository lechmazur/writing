<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s tactile exploration versus Thorne’s burn attempt, but "courage to begin again" edges toward over-articulated epiphany under peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "film negative strip a compass" crystallizes legacy’s burden with conceptual cost, though resonator’s "new frequency" lacks causal motivation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery—the resonator’s trembling needles and film’s "cold plastic vs feverish heat"—constrains choices and charges the final image with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation deepens via Elias’s shifting understanding of legacy, but the cost remains felt rather than visibly altering tactics; packing diaries lacks concrete forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through Thorne’s weeping at the desk and the saved film strip, avoiding moralizing; "legacy’s burden to compel" reweights stakes without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct ("calloused fingers tracing vibrations"), but "sensitively perceptive" repeats verbatim, creating minor scaffold in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Simultaneity error ("resonator spiked as a deep hum filled") in climax undermines causality; otherwise flawless density and rhythm serve Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms climate fiction tropes via echo cartographer lens, but "ivory tower academia ignoring warnings" lacks fresh moral calculus for full 9.0 distinction.</comment>
