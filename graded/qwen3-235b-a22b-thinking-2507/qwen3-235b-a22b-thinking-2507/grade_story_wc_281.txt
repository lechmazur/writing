<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine (skeptic who designed pills yet seeks somatic truth), embodied through molars buzzing and throat thrum. Final choice to visualize somatic pathways earns closure with Lena's tears as visible cost. Minor over-articulation in "somatic echoes" slightly strains peak-beat authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: the recall notice's glow against prismatic light, foreclosing telepathy for somatic understanding. Accumulative lens holds through density buildup—ozone haze to fractal light—reweighting stakes via somatic marker realization. Orientation anchors by line 3 with static shock and shattered screen.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Light painting studio and muscovite sliver constrain choices (projectors repurposed inward, geode as fractal lens) and charge the final image—shimmering branches mapping wrist pulses. Micro-setting elevates beyond atmosphere; the "fractally precise" light physically shapes Aris's new protocol with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation via deepening knowledge: pills' failure reframes as somatic echo discovery, narrowing options to the light-rig solution. Cost legible in the damaged mapper and Lena's tearful realization. Agency-driven under Accumulative lens, though the shift from "static shock" to solution feels slightly compressed despite strong causal linkage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "understanding illuminated by the body’s own fractally precise song" avoids moralizing through concrete action (muscle-tightened light beams). Final image reweights telepathy failure into somatic resonance without abstraction. Minor risk in "something better" phrasing, but saved by immediate sensory payoff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct—scientific precision ("somatic markers") fused with poetic compression ("ghostly trails of yesterday’s abandoned artworks"). Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure: short phrases for crisis ("static shock still buzzed"), lyrical flow for discovery. Dialogue carries subtext via light-painted spiral tracing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fractally precise" repetition earns thematic weight. Sentences vary rhythmically ("Dust motes danced...") with strategic density—ozone haze simultaneously sets scene and mirrors neural chaos. Minor overwriting in "trembling, willowglass hope," but closure beat ("body’s own song") remains crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms telepathy tropes through somatic markers and light-painting science. Emotional specificity in Aris's "quieter need" over redemption avoids cliché. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off: fractal lens reframes failure as discovery. "Willowglass hope" slightly forced but redeemed by final image's earned fragility.</comment>
