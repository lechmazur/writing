<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "beauty lived in the cracks" realization, but rhetorical questions flirt with therapy-speak in early beats, slightly diluting embodied emotion during peak crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully—"reality was always fragmented" crystallizes stance with visceral cost ("ache... burned now with purpose") under Accumulative lens; storm intensification perfectly reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lighthouse lens directly constrains choice: refracted light mirrors psyche, then transforms to "fluid" beam when she heals, charging the final image; salt-wind "closing in" pressures every action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through thread-untangling beats—The World's knot forces trade-off between "perfect art" belief and embracing fragmentation; cost is her artistic identity, visible in hands stained with purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from tarot threads and lighthouse beam; final descent to paint "fragments" resonates without moralizing, reweighting "fractured reality" as strength through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature impeccable ("walls closing in" as embodied anxiety), rhythm modulates with storm intensity; slight register drift in "luminescent ache" but character-particular under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "threads pulsed... luminescent ache" avoids cliché through precise textural specificity; final line’s "lighthouse held its breath" achieves earned lyricism without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "artist's block" trope via tarot threads as memory-anchors; lighthouse-as-psyche framing feels inevitable yet fresh, with risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
