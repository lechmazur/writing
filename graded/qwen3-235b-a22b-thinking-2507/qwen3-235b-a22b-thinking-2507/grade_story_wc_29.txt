<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lacks interior contradiction; "cautiously hopeful" trait manifests consistently but without conflicting impulses under pressure. Motivation clear but no visible trade-off when rerouting power—cost remains externalized to administrative fallout rather than personal sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: clean signal proves cosmic truth while alarms foreshadow institutional retaliation. Cost is visceral in "administrators would use the power surge as an excuse," with causal chain (deception → countermeasure → consequence) holding flawlessly under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Astronomical charts function as micro-setting that constrains choices (smudged coffee stain → rolled proof) and charges the final image. Grounding rods transform from passive infrastructure to active tool, with Cygnus X-1’s clean signal gaining meaning through prior contamination.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving cosmic truth amid sabotage) tightens meaningfully: rerouting power narrows options (safety vs. truth), with cost (administrative retaliation) viscerally felt. Escalation driven entirely by Aris’s agency—protest timing exploited as camouflage, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "power plays" evolves from abstraction to embodied struggle (cosmic tricksters exploiting campus division). Final "clean, ancient whisper" answers central question without moralizing—truth as quiet defiance against noise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("static a constant companion," charts as "maps of resistance"), but "ethereal grit" descriptor slightly detaches from Aris’s voice. Syntax mirrors his focused state—clinical during analysis, lyrical at climax—without overwriting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences like "His world narrowed to the oscilloscope display" compress setting and psychology. Subsonic pulse description avoids purple prose while vivid ("invisible, inaudible, silent counter-offensive"), with final line earning lyricism through prior concrete details.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "scientist vs. bureaucracy" trope through specific physics (17.3Hz resonance) and dual-layered deception. Risk-taking in making protests active camouflage—not backdrop—elevates stakes while maintaining emotional authenticity.</comment>
