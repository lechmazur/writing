<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "excruciatingly gentle" micro-choices under bear encounter; embodied epiphany avoids diagnostic labels. Slight over-articulation in "relentless pursuit of mechanical perfection" risks abstraction but saved by concrete blueprints memory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: bear's departure crystallizes "dream resting lightly" with felt cost ("warmth spreading through glacial hush"). Accumulative lens holds via sensory density escalation to irreversible stance shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt constrains action (stillness with bear) and charges closure (final walk "after rain"); petrichor evolves from weight to "gentle breath." Tool (oiler) essential to final image as reconciliation symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (abandoned dream) tightens through bear's silent presence forcing stance crystallization. Agency-driven escalation via Elias' micro-choices (lowering oiler) reweights cost visibly in "releasing its ghost" realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "journey itself" epiphany earned via gear-mending metaphor, not stated moral. Final image reweights "petrichor nostalgia" with irreversible emotional cost, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("minuscule gear," "crystal stillness") persists under stress; rhythmic control shifts from lyrical dawn to compressed tension. Patterned "excruciatingly gentle" repetitions taught early and paid off in closure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; "glacial hush pressing in like cold glass" shows textural precision. Final line achieves maximum density: "petrichor nostalgia no longer a weight, but a gentle breath" recharges opening with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clockmaker's perfectionism with bear's primal "simply was" avoids nature-epiphany clichés. Emotional specificity in "acceptance of imperfection as part of the design" transforms universal theme through occupational lens.</comment>
