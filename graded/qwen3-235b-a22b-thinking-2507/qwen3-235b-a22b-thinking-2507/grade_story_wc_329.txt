<question>1</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices (shifting weight to command note) and contradictory impulses (fear/hope in statue's hesitation moment). Final renunciation of mechanical servitude earned by visceral heart-rhythm synchronization, with visible cost in the statue's destruction. Only hairline slip: Elara's competence near-climactic moment slightly overshadows struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the green sprout reconfigures "breaking free" as reclamation with undeniable conceptual cost (statue's destruction). Accumulative/Textural lens holds from "rebellion played in whispers" to resonant cadence shift in final phrase. Cost proof crystallized in "where its roots had been, a single, impossible thing pushed through."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Locust shell functions as micro-setting object that constrains choice (amplifying heartbeat into subsonic plea) and charges closure ("warm against her skin"). Sensory hierarchy masterfully filters brass orchard through musician's urgency—copper leaves' clink matters more than sky color. Meets 9+ gate by shaping tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by Elara's agency under Accumulative lens: her deepening resonance ("pouring yearning into every bow stroke") narrows options to one decisive command. Cost unmistakable in statue's white-hot roots and uprooted earth. Dominant stake ("reawaken beauty") tightens through single pressure point where hesitation crystallizes into liberation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: green sprout offers non-literal answer to "breaking free" as reclamation, not escape. Avoids moralizing while charging "tarnished wonder" into "scent of blossoms" without abstraction. Final image reweights premise with conceptual cost—statues as anchors—fulfilling Q5's 9+ quick test through earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is singular: "sound like dew on forgotten petals" reveals musician's embodied noticing. Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure ("resonantly soft" motif taught early, pays off in climax). Zero head-hopping; compression of "granite eyes flickering blue" teaches pattern without muddying closure. Meets 9+ quick test with surgical precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold—every sentence advances multiple elements ("copper leaves softened, their metallic sheen bleeding into verdant hues" merges setting, action, theme). Final line recharges locust shell motif with visceral warmth. Peak beats avoid figurative muddle: "heart hammering against the shell" maintains clarity while heightening pressure. Text-artifact free throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms "music reawakens nature" trope through mechanical specificity (brass fruit, clockwork hearts). Fresh inflection: heart rhythms as signal, statues as anchors. Risk-taking heightens stakes—statue's hesitation feels earned, not gimmicky. Emotional truth in "breaking free as reclamation" avoids generic templates, meeting 9+ quick test through synthesis.</comment>
