<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in the submerged choice ("choose the light" vs expedience) and embodied cost ("lungs burned, but he pushed forward"), though embezzlement motivation lacks specific tactile memory anchoring the past.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost: "crushing weight of erased sins warring with awe" crystallizes the empathy test, and microbial light reigniting proves earned change under Causal lens without retroactive fixes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent lake constrains every choice (stepping carefully, submerged route) and charges the final image—light reigniting as empathy proof—elevating it beyond atmosphere to active pressure point.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when Silas turns right into water, sacrificing speed for moral cost; escalation peaks as the girl's tear reweights the dominant empathy stake with visceral, felt consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "kindness, like this lake, was both delicate and unbreakable" reweights the premise without moralizing, using the lake’s fragility/resilience as organic metaphor for empathy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice modulates perfectly under pressure—short, sensory fragments during the swim ("Water filled his ears") contrast with lyrical reflection at climax—showing distinct perceptual bias without syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; "sterile ache behind his eyes" exemplifies high-density showing, and final line’s rhythm ("carrying fragile hope...") crystallizes closure without figurative clutter in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms prison-break trope through ecosystem rules: the lake’s delicacy makes empathy tangible, with the signed baseball avoiding gimmickry via the girl’s authentic, non-verbal reaction.</comment>
