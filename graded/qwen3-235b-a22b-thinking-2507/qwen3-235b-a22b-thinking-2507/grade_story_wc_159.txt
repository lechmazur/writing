<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion ("foxglove regret thick as dust") and credible endurance earn closure, but lacks contradictory impulses in peak moments; micro-choices reveal values yet internal conflict remains linear under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with Charged Poise closure ("foxglove regret settled in her bones"), but lens ambiguity past midpoint (-0.4) caps high-band; cost proof solid via final image though escalation lacks protagonist-driven narrowing of options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Opal library functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choices (opal amplifies echoes, dust affects voice) and charges the final image; "cracked bamboo tube" evolves from problem to tool, meeting 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving names) tightens through accelerating decay, but protagonist agency remains reactive rather than driving escalation; cost (emotional exhaustion) charges the final image yet lacks visible trade-offs in tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars ("kintsugi for the soul," "foxglove regret") without moralizing; final image reweights "deserted marvels" as beautiful/aching endurance, offering resonant non-literal answer to extinction of feeling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("opal shelves glowed like captured sunsets") and rhythmic control under pressure; zero head-hopping, with lyric compression taught early ("wind chime’s bamboo tube lay cracked") and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with no figurative muddle in peak beats; minor synonym loop ("fractures"/"fracture’s jagged geometry") triggers -0.2, but density remains high and closure image ("fragile archive of light") crystal clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms library trope through specific mechanics (opal resonance, echo physics); "foxglove regret" as embodied tone avoids abstraction, with risk-taking (accumulative pressure) heightening stakes coherently without gimmickry.</comment>
