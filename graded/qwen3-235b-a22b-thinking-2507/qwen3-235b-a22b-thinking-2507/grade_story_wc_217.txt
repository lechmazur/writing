<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (idealistic poet vs frustrated writer) embodied through micro-choices like ignoring irritation to retrieve feather, but child's wail vanishing lacks pressure that tests her endurance; epiphany slightly unearned by coincidence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visible cost ("completion was a myth") under Accumulative lens, but child's abrupt silence enables epiphany via coincidence rather than protagonist agency, weakening causality at pivotal rupture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt lagoon functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (retrieving feather from shallows) and charges final image ("cobalt mirror reflecting sky's mended light"); sensory details like "barbs streaming water" directly reweight theme without ornamental excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing "woven dawns") tightens via kite disruption forcing engagement with discord, but reliance on coincidental feather appearance and vanished child wail undercuts protagonist-driven escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of feather carried to sea offers resonant non-literal answer to "woven dawns" without moralizing; theme emerges through particulars like "beauty lived in the mended tear," avoiding thematic echo while reweighting prior struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("reeds like liquid pearls," "burnished hush") modulates under pressure with rhythmic control; voice remains consistent through emotional shifts without syntactic monotony or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, but "vibrant emerald and sapphire hues dulled by water yet still holding quiet fire" risks figurative muddle in high-pressure beat; final line achieves crystalline propulsion without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "beauty in brokenness" trope through specific lagoon mechanics and "woven dawns" metaphor; emotional truth in poet's struggle avoids cliché, with feather's release as fresh inflection that grows from prior particulars.</comment>
