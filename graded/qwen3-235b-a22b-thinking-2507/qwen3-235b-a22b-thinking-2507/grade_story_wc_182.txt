<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation burns clear but interior contradiction lacks depth; her flawless execution during the ritual sacrifices nuance for efficiency, missing the 9+ requirement for simultaneous contradictory impulses under pressure despite strong embodied emotion in the blood-ink moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Conceptual Repricing where the diary's completion reweights time as cyclical symphony with visible cost (sacrificed truth), but escalation under Accumulative lens lacks density—the ritual unfolds smoothly without meaningful deepening of options beyond the initial temporal decay pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mount Veridian functions as active constraint: seismic fractures become textual voids, the mountain demands blood-price for passage, and the final "labyrinthine heart holding its breath" charges closure—environment fully qualifies for 9+ gate by shaping every critical choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Kael's spinning compass and sweat, but Elara's resourcefulness faces no authentic struggle; the ritual succeeds on first attempt without trade-offs, weakening cost legibility despite the blood-ink sacrifice being visible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "cost of knowledge is humility" written in blood, avoiding moralizing; the final symphony image reweights forgotten mistakes as cyclical lessons without stated morals, achieving resonant non-literal closure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "dust motes danced" and "unheard symphony" elevates voice, but stress compression falters—Elara's ritual cognition remains unnaturally articulate ("dipping her quill") without syntactic fragmentation that should mirror temporal urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity ("cracked leather," "green luminescence") anchors momentum, but template cadence appears in the final paragraph ("The library... The mountain... The botanical diary...") dulling closure's rhythmic charge despite otherwise clean propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Library of unlearned lessons" transforms time-travel tropes through linguistic specificity (Root Tongue, chronos-ferns), but the arcane linguist premise relies on convenient expertise without meaningful struggle, missing the risk distinction needed for 9.0+.</comment>
