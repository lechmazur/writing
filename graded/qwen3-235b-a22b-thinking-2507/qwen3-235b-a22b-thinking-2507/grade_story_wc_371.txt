<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (guilt vs. active hope) drives micro-choices like "heuristically gentle" bread-eating; locket discovery earns renunciation of self-blame with visible cost in final gardening resolve. Therapy-speak "tenuous absolution" risks abstraction but is redeemed by embodied soil-tremors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "silence didn’t feel like an end. It felt like a seed waiting" crystallizes stance shift with felt cost (transformed guilt). Accumulative lens holds through sensory accumulation; locket discovery tightens options toward earned gardening continuation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting (locket photo, bread crust) charges closure: children’s laughter reweights grief into action. Soil-dusted hands constrain trowel use; ivy-strangled statues mirror internal erosion without overt symbolism. Sensory hierarchy sharpens crisis (yeast scent over visual detail).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake (guilt over passive acceptance) tightens through locket discovery, forcing active remembrance. Pressure coheres via Accumulative lens: vanished bakery → found photo → gardening as rebellion. Cost legible in "fiercely ordinary" crumb sacrifice; single deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: bread crust → locket → peas as "sacred in soil." Final image ("seed waiting") reweights grief without moralizing. Epiphany earned through gardening labor, not abstraction; "stitches in larger fabric" avoids tidy binaries while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("heuristically gentle," "creeping normality noticer") persists under stress. Rhythmic control in high-pressure beats (locket discovery) avoids ventriloquism; "dew indistinguishable from rain" modulates tone without POV leakage. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffolding: "crust crackling under her fingers" advances character and atmosphere. Minor figurative muddle ("grief settled like frost") in opening beat avoids peak-pressure zones. No loops; final line’s "seed waiting" resolves with textural specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic hope via guerrilla gardening’s mundane rebellion. Specifics (calendula near collapsed aviary, snapdragon seeds) transform tropes; emotional truth in "fiercely ordinary" closure. Risk-taking in quiet Earned Stasis heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
