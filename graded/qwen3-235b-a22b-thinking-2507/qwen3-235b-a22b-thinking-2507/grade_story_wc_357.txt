<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s reverence for the planet’s memory versus her scientific drive, crystallized when she pockets the arrow not as trophy but "tuning fork." Micro-choice of pressing the cold tip against warm stone reveals her hierarchy of values under pressure, though internal conflict during the echo realization lacks deeper layering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: gravity’s imminent snap-back crystallizes options while the final line reweights resilience through undeniable conceptual cost ("resilience wasn’t found—it was gathered"). Orientation anchors by word 25, and Accumulative/Textural lens (sensory density → cadence shift at "gathering of echoes") holds cohesively through the vibration’s resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inverted rivers function as micro-setting that actively constrains navigation (standard instruments fail), while the cove’s converging streams directly enable the climax. Crucially, the "whirling silence" evolves from pressure to singing understanding, charging the final image with the planet’s memory—environment shaping both tactics and thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Accumulative escalation: the arrow’s vibration deepens knowledge, forcing Elara’s stance crystallization (pressing it against the arch). Cost is unmistakable in the "stark contrast" between the tip’s coldness and saplings’ warmth, reconfiguring her mission from discovery to carrying forward memory. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the arrow’s transformation from debris to "tuning fork," avoiding moralizing. The final image ("resilience wasn’t found—it was gathered") reweights the inversion hour as active remembrance, offering non-literal resolution to the central question without stating a moral—earned through concrete particulars like the saplings’ accelerated growth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature evident in pilot-specific details ("magnetized boots," "crystalline sap veins"), with rhythm modulating under pressure (short sentences during foliage push). Purposeful elision of prior expeditions pays off via the arrow’s vibration, though "profound, internal hum" slightly drifts from embodied POV in one high-stakes beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences multiply purpose (e.g., "gripped the yoke... eyes fixed" establishes focus and inversion). Final line’s cadence shift crystallizes theme without muddle. Minor deduction for "profound, internal hum" abstracting emotion where concrete embodiment was expected during peak discovery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "resilience" trope through planetary memory synthesis, with emotionally specific details (non-reflective arrow metal, gravity’s "snap back") avoiding generic abstraction. Risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens stakes coherently, making the conceptual payoff feel inevitable in hindsight—fresh inflection through the arrow’s reweighted meaning.</comment>
