<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction manifests in action: "balancedly daring" shown via theorem test and final descent choice, not summary. Embodied emotion avoids labels—"sticky warmth of regret" concretizes hesitation. Micro-choice placing chipped die reveals hierarchy of values with cost (unblemished die's echo).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "confinement could hold boundless hope" crystallizes stance crystallization under Accumulative lens. Orientation clear by line 1; lens taught early via "perpetual motion" pattern. Cost proof: "missed opportunity... foundation he walks upon" makes conceptual price legible at rupture's edge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting (dice) charges final image: chipped die's "fracture a reminder" directly constrains descent choice. Sensory specificity evolves causally—void's "rough grain" reweights door memory into tactile cost. Staircase isn't backdrop; its regeneration forces tactics (convergence timing) and becomes the earned foundation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via density increase: math theorem → rupture → realization that hesitation itself is the texture. Agency drives escalation—Aris's entropy calculation causes rupture, not coincidence. Cost unmistakable: choosing perpetual motion as "boundless hope" forecloses escape with visible emotional price in final descent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: "perfection traps, flaws make motion possible" earned through dice physics, not stated. Final image reweights "missed opportunity" as active foundation without moralizing. Subtext in void's texture—sensation replaces abstraction—avoids thematic echo while charging conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: mathematical cadence ("harmonic resonance") fractures into sensory bursts ("cool silk and static") under pressure. Rhythmic control peaks at rupture—"sound like shattering glass ripped"—with compression taught early via "grim optimist" framing. Zero head-hopping; elision (door backstory) pays off in void's tactile revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion via concrete verbs: "tracing," "whispered," "tore open." Final line recharges "perpetual motion" motif with irreversible weight. Figurative language sparse and precise—"sticky warmth of regret" avoids muddle. Closure beat ("next step... certainty of perpetual motion") achieves crystalline density without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms regret trope through specific physics: dice entropy as mathematical flaw enabling rupture. Emotional truth in hesitation's texture—not the door but "suspended breath"—avoids generic templates. Risk-taking (abstract concept made visceral) heightens stakes without gimmickry; staircase's regeneration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
