<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority masterfully concrete ("knotted fingers," "borrowed ache"), with contradictory impulses (eccentric isolation vs. connection) driving the "Danke" choice. No therapy-speak; embodiment avoids "witnessed isolation" becoming abstract. Flaw: "softly persistent" remains label-only without tactical tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("no longer a puzzle but a promise" reconfiguring the Edelweiss). Accumulative lens held perfectly: mist/memory density tightens stakes to the final whisper. Orientation flawless in opening line; lens unambiguous by midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Opal dock and Edelweiss function as micro-setting constraining choice—Silas "turns it in fading light" triggering memory surge. Sensory hierarchy precise (salt/wind hands, scentless flower), charging final logbook image. No white-room syndrome; mist blurs sea/sky to mirror internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding gesture) escalates via memory density, narrowing options to the "Für die Heimat" realization. Cost legible in "felt less alone" as Silas accepts emotional vulnerability. Agency pure: observation gaps drive the climax without coincidence. One deepening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through Edelweiss reweighting—from "puzzle" to "promise"—avoiding moralizing. Final image ("warm against his palm") answers "home" without stating it. No thematic echo; "gaps were bridges" earns resonance through prior particulars. Complexity in honoring a stranger without redemption.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystalline: lighthouse keeper notices salt-cracked hands, not sky colors. Rhythm modulates with pressure ("murmuring in a language... before collapsing"). Zero head-hopping; "borrowed memories" taught early via tactile triggers. Voice distinct in "eccentric keeper of borrowed light."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; "opal dock shimmering like frozen moonlight" does triple duty (setting, tone, metaphor). Sentence rhythm varies perfectly ("He unpinned... cradling it"). Minor density risk in "brittle petals of dried Edelweiss" but payoff in memory surge justifies it. Closure beat immaculate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "stranger's token" trope through Edelweiss specificity (Alpine flower in sailor's pocket) and non-obvious "gaps as bridges" insight. Emotional truth in Silas's quiet resolution avoids sentimental "connection" tropes. Risk-taking (memory-as-atmosphere) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
