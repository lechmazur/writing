<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction under pressure is thin; "chaste defiance was not absence but presence" veers into diagnostic label-speak during climax, undermining embodied conflict despite strong micro-choices in thread-untangling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with the city's awakening and "alarming serenity fractured," but the central knot resolution relies slightly on convenient specificity ("founding queen's sorrow") rather than prior causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Snow and prism threads function as micro-setting that actively constrains choices (precision in cold, thread fragility) and charges the final image through "first footprints of a new day" reweighting untouched skirts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative escalation excels as each released echo ("child's laughter...") visibly frays the lullaby, but Elara's personal cost remains underdeveloped beyond sweat; conceptual cost (end of conformity) is unmistakable in the fractured serenity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "weaponized grace" and footprints motif, avoiding moralizing, but "chaste defiance" phrasing borders on thematic echo that slightly dilutes earned resonance in the climax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("snow whispering," "frozen music"), yet "body a vessel for poetry" risks register drift from Elara's plausible lexicon, momentarily distancing voice during high pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is texturally rich with zero scaffold loops, but "alarming serenity" repetition in the closure beat ("fractured, replaced by raw chaos") triggers a -0.3 artifact penalty for ornamental use in final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "harvest of echoes" through bodily poetic language and chaste rebellion; the prism's tangible silencing creates emotional specificity that avoids trope familiarity while risking lyric density without obscuring stakes.</comment>
