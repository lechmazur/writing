<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "I fear I’m still dead" confession—embodied terror and defiance coexist without therapy-speak. Flaw: micro-choices lack hierarchy (why photograph clasp first?), slightly weakening causal chain to final act.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands perfectly: photograph revealing resuscitation moment makes fear’s vulnerability tangible. Cost is undeniable in "Fear recoiled, its form fraying," fulfilling Hybrid lens escalation through Clara’s agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: luminance-clasp constrains choices (reading dream dictionary, triggering flash) and charges final image ("clasp’s faint pulse"). Avoids symbolism by making phosphorescent mold a tactical resource, not metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (tricking fear) tightens meaningfully when Clara’s confession summons Fear itself. Agency-driven escalation under Hybrid lens: "unbosoming" redefines options with visible cost (Fear’s dissolution = loss of spectral guidance).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically: "fear could not survive the light of acknowledgment" crystallizes through photographic mechanics, not moralizing. Final dawn imagery reweights "repulsive allure" into earned resilience without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("taste of copper and failure," "photographically cursed") modulates under stress. Slight register drift in "repulsive allure like maggots writhing"—more authorial than Clara’s voice—but paid off by thematic cohesion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but adjacent "shattered mirrors reflected distorted limbs... peeling murals oozed slime" creates paraphrase loop. Template cadence ("She touched... She fumbled... She raised") dulls immediacy in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms haunted-funhouse trope through photographic curse mechanics. "Unbosoming fear" premise feels inevitable via dream dictionary paradoxes. Risk-taking (lyric closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry—dawn light as antithesis to luminance.</comment>
