<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("cultivated estrangement" vs Elena's call) manifests in micro-choices like pressing the disc to the receiver. Embodied cost in "throat tightened" avoids therapy-speak. Final renunciation earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: "Goodbye" reconfigures endings as beginnings with felt cost in the "cavernous" booth. Accumulative lens holds through glass disc's evolving resonance. Cost proof evident in "he couldn't break his own rules."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (glass disc) constrains choices—played only when silence grows heavy—and charges the final image ("surface warm from his touch"). Sensory hierarchy ("vibrate in his teeth") reflects Silas's tactile profession.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Silas's agency when Elena calls back: rejecting her ("Wrong number") forecloses connection with visible cost ("throat tightened"). Dominant stake (estrangement vs. human contact) tightens meaningfully in the second call.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the disc's loop: "endings aren't doors slammed shut" crystallizes into the final "teaching silence how to sing." No moralizing; resonant answer via "Goodbye" as new beginning reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("electric buzz seeped through concrete to vibrate in his teeth"). Voice modulates under pressure—shorter sentences during Elena's call—but "melodically haunted" repetition slightly dilutes rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density ("flickered like faulty neon") with minimal scaffolding. Minor paraphrase loop in "crystalline spiral" descriptions. Zero artifacts in closure beat; final line recharges motif without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: glass harmonica as emotional conduit transforms "last phone booth" trope. Specificity ("museum dumpster" salvage) avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (quiet closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
