<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("wistfully pragmatic") embodied through soil-calloused hands and deliberate shard placement; final choice to persist earns closure via brass/glass actions under pressure, though "wistfully pragmatic" label slightly abstracts the cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: the cat stepping into light crystallizes Elara's vulnerability-to-belonging shift; Accumulative lens holds as "quivering hush" tightens into "gentle hum" through her actions, with harbor's transformation reweighting darkness as canvas.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fire escape crevices and harbor constrain every choice—shards catch moonlight only because of specific bolt corrosion; final image of cat's fur "catching glow like scattered stars" charges closure through micro-setting, proving environment's indispensable role.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>Escalation via Accumulative lens: "quivering hush" pressure deepens through sensory density (spider-web tension, harbor's breath) until moon shift forces crystallization; cost is Elara's exposed vulnerability as she "traced the gauge tooth," making her effort feel precarious yet necessary.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "light sets it free" reweights from locksmith's platitude to embodied truth when shards fracture darkness; final line ("light now lived where shadows once reigned") avoids moralizing by showing transformation through the cat's belonging.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "calloused from soil and steel" filters harbor as "liquid silver" while prioritizing tool textures; rhythmic control mirrors oar-motion cadence in high-pressure beats, though "wistfully pragmatic" slightly drifts from Elara's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "quivering hush" metaphor sustains coherence without muddle. Minor density dip in harbor description ("luminous calm no longer a void but a canvas") risks abstraction, but final image's "scattered stars" on cat fur maintains propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms urban darkness trope through hyper-specific tools (bitting gauge tooth) and "protected vulnerability" synthesis; risk-taking in quiet closure—where light replaces confrontation—heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable through prior details.</comment>
