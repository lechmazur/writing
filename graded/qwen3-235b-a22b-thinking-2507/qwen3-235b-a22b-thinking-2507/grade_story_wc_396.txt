<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Silas’s embodied emotion ("shadows deepening as they felt his grief turn to shame") and contradictory impulses (calm urgency vs clan panic) drive micro-choices under pressure. Near-flawless interiority avoids therapy-speak, though slight protagonist competence perfection slightly blunts struggle depth in reconstitution sequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: Kael’s trembling hand and "grief turn to shame" crystallize the shift from accusation to empathy. Accumulative lens holds through density-increasing mirror reflections, with orientation clear by paragraph 1 ("lighthouse," "ice floes").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lighthouse orchard actively constrains choices (roots gripping cliffside for final shard retrieval) and charges closure via "apples glowed like tiny lighthouses." Environment shapes tactics throughout, meeting 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by Silas’s agency (mirror navigation, reconstitution), not coincidence, with cost unmistakable in Kael’s visceral shame-to-empathy shift. Dominant stake (empathy vs accusation) tightens through one decisive deepening: the crystal vision reframing the crevasse incident.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (crystal showing rescue) not abstraction; final image of "lanterns along cliff path" offers resonant answer to central question. Avoids moralizing—"courage wasn’t absence of fracture" earned through prior struggle, not stated thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("weighted breath before reply," "shadows woven like silver thread") modulates rhythm under pressure. Consistent third-limited POV with syntactic compression during tension ("Gasps cut the silence") meets 9+ voice control without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts; high density ("map empathy onto action" doing triple duty) and clear propulsion. Final line "the floes, for now, held" resolves with action charging motif—peak beats avoid figurative muddle while maintaining lyrical precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "broken object reparation" trope via empathy-mapping mechanic; "shadow-laced" specificity avoids archetype. Risk distinction (+0.3) for Accumulative lens in peace narrative, with emotional truth in "children lost to sudden crevasses" resisting sentimentality.</comment>
