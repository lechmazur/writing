<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract with "translate heartbeats into maps" phrasing; contradictory impulses under pressure are underdeveloped despite strong embodied cold tremors during the vial sealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with "storybook plate warm against her chest" proving cost; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through eclipse-driven stillness intensifying the ritual's stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Subarctic crater setting actively constrains choices—flash-paper volatility demands cold-induced slowness, while the eclipse's "moving stillness" enables the ritual, charging the final vial image with environmental necessity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through the eclipse's time pressure narrowing options to one perfect moment; cost is visceral in Elara's physical strain ("fingers trembled only with cold"), but escalation lacks a distinct mid-scene deepening beyond the atmospheric buildup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "safekept starlight" as preserved memory, avoiding moralizing; the final vial image reweights the premise without stating a moral, though "translating heartbeats" borders on abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in alchemy-focused details ("patience honed by volatile nature"), but filter verbs like "she knew" slightly dull immediacy during the map-etching climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "thinner than moth-wing" exemplifies high-density imagery, though the semicolon splice in "volatile nature of her craft; one tremor" creates a minor cadence hiccup in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-preservation alchemy avoids sentimentality; the flash-paper constraint transforms a universal theme into specific, inevitable stakes where removing the crater's cold would break the ritual's logic.</comment>
