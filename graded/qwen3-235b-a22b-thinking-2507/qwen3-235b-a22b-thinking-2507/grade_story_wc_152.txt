<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through micro-choices (fumbling thimble while counting seconds); embodied tension peaks when "heart hammered" but she forces clumsy panic. Final renunciation of safety—stitching the flame—earns closure with visible cost in trembling candle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the stitched candle flame crystallizes options with conceptual cost (impending explosions vs. silent resistance). Accumulative lens holds—density intensifies via dome mechanics, and cost legibility in "flame trembling in sudden draft" proves irreversible stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The eternal candle constrains every critical choice (decoding coordinates, masking transmission) and charges the final image—a recurring tool that evolves from utility to symbol. Autumn’s "first frost" deadline pressures tactics without cliché, anchoring time through woodsmoke and decaying leaves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara’s agency: synchronizing transmission via dome rotation narrows options to a seven-minute window. Cost crystallizes in the trembling candle—a felt price for sending the warning—elevating tension beyond abstract conspiracy to visceral, immediate consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "reading silences between stars" evolves into stitching a candle flame—a resonant answer to "unheard stories" without moralizing. Final image reweights resistance as quiet, enduring light, avoiding sentimentality through embodied stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("phosphorescent ink activated by heat") and rhythmic control under pressure: short clauses during dome alignment ("three, two, one") mirror heartbeat. No head-hopping; compression of "military governor’s fleet" via coordinates teaches pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("deliberately dropping thread twice to reinforce reputation") propels momentum. Figurative language avoids muddle—candle’s "unwavering light" precisely serves decoding mechanics. Final line’s "candle flame, burning in the dark" charges closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: embroidery as espionage tool transforms "disguised wisdom" trope through specific mechanics (phosphorescent ink, dome-synchronized light pulses). Risk-taking (rebellion via stitching) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable via prior causal threads.</comment>
