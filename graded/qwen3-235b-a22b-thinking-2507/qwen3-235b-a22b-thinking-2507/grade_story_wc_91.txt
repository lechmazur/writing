<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak but lacks contradictory impulses; epiphany resolves too neatly without struggle ("didn't mourn... embraced"). Final choice lacks visible cost beyond abstract realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("embrace destitution"), but prophecy exposition undermines Accumulative lens cohesion. Orientation perfect within 120 words; celestial alignment anchors time/place.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Black sand constrains choices (bare feet on phosphorescent terrain) and charges final image; bottled bugs function as micro-setting. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency ("silk brushing stone" during crisis).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fetching water) diffuses into prophecy subplot. Detour motivation lacks friction; "risking safety" setup pays off weakly via coincidence (volcano calming), violating Situational pressure rules.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Thematic echo in final line ("dance of small luminous steps") triggers -0.7 penalty. Conceptual repricing fails as moralizing replaces scene pressure; prophecy exposition overrides organic emergence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature strong ("scent of ozone and possibility"), but prophecy exposition breaks focalization ("Elders spoke..."). Voice modulates under pressure until late thematic intrusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Final-third artifacts: "orchestrates coincidences" is diagnostic label-speak (-0.6), prophecy exposition is thematic summary (-0.4). Template cadence in "he’d yearned... he’d taken" dulls closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of destitution/philanthropy through sensory texture, but safety-hedging in moral resolution ("woven safety net"). Prophecy trope undermines risk-taking; emotional specificity avoids genericity.</comment>
