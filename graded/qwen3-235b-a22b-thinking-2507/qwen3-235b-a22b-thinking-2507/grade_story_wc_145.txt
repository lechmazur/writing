<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (stubborn precision vs. mortal risk), embodied emotion via "numb despite gloves," micro-choices like aligning phrasebook with frost. Slight over-reliance on "dry-witted" label rather than pure action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost pattern density creates closure via Charged Poise (cost: freezing if wrong). Orientation clear by line 10; one deepening (condensation interpretation) suffices. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Frost on glass functions as indispensable micro-setting—constrains choice (deciphering glyphs) and charges final image (ice melting into rivers). Sensory details purposeful (bruised amethyst lake, skeletal outpost groans).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (river origins) escalates via knowledge deepening under Accumulative lens; cost ("freeze before spring") legible on page. Single tightening (glyphs + frost = map) narrows options decisively with felt consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action ("sky weeps and land remembers"), not abstraction. Final line reweights "worrying tranquility" into "companion," offering resonant answer without moralizing—pure CR closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (atlas editor seeing "watershed divides" in frost), rhythmic control under pressure ("frost patterns bloomed... shifting"). Zero head-hopping; lexicon perfectly calibrated to scholar’s mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot ("condensation resolved into topography"). Figurative language precise ("skeletal structure," "bruised amethyst") without muddle. Final line crystallizes theme with zero overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: atmospheric convergence theory transforms river-origin trope. Specific details ("dog-ear at 'confluence'") ground risk-taking; emotional truth in "stubborn precision" payoff avoids generic discovery narratives.</comment>
