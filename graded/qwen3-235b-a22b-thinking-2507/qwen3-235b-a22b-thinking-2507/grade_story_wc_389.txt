<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses (faith in texts vs. dawning betrayal) act simultaneously in the radio-message realization; her sabotage choice is earned by prior micro-choices (tuning frequencies, tracing portico fracture) with visible cost ("this wasn’t stargazing, it was sabotage"). "Gritty determination hardened her whimsy" slightly abstracts the emotional shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Decisive Change with undeniable cost: the prophet’s faltering rise and Elara’s physical exhaustion ("leaned against cool glass") reconfigure options under the causal lens. Orientation is anchored by line 3 ("stormlit observatory above the churning cloud sea"), and escalation narrows options cleanly from deciphering to action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The cobalt portico functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (rerouting power to its lattice) and charging the final image ("glowing softly, first true light... rose and ash"). Sensory details reflect urgency: "frozen finger" and "faintly green dials" narrow perception during crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally when "variant allegiance" reframes the prophet as threat, foreclosing passive observation. Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency (interpreting "seven shadows" message), with cost legible in her shift to sabotage; the sky-cutter’s arrival raises stakes without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "Dawn is woven" reweights "shadows vs. light" without moralizing. The violet-lit portico offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "shape new dawn," but "enduring song of the shadows" slightly edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: she notices "fractured frequencies" not just the storm. Rhythm modulates under pressure—lyrical ("crown of broken teeth") to staccato ("Gritty determination hardened her whimsy")—with no head-hopping. "Lyrically prophetic" slightly elevates peak-stress diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion via concrete verbs ("scrambled," "initiated," "refracted"). Final line recharges portico motif with "hues of rose and ash." Minor deduction for "blind flock" bordering cliché, but redeemed by context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis: astronomer using shadows (not light) as solution subverts trope. Specificity (cobalt glass physics, harmonic resonance) makes premise irreplaceable; emotional truth in her shift from faith to sabotage feels inevitable.</comment>
