<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (logic vs lethal grace) manifest in duel positioning choices; mechanical arm's fatigue creates genuine struggle. But "diplomatically fierce" trait remains label-only without visible tradeoffs during climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Vorlag's stunned disarmament crystallizes water rights with conceptual cost ("questions arriving home"). Causal lens holds perfectly—shadow alignment forces treaty revelation through motivated spatial choices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Brook's reflected light actively enables shadow calibration; mechanical arm's grinding joints constrain dueling tactics. Glass dome's light patterns charge the final image, but sundial's physicality could pressure more choices earlier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (decipher treaty mid-duel) tightens relentlessly via spatial constraints. Cost is legible when Silas sacrifices defense to align with seventh hole—but "diplomatically fierce" motivation lacks sufficient friction during Vorlag's attack.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Questions becoming destinations" emerges organically through sundial mechanics, not moralizing. Final brook imagery reweights the central metaphor without stating theme. Heraclitus quote feels decorative rather than integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: notices "calibrated holes" and "shifting patterns" like a logician. Compression during duel ("foil a silver streak") heightens pressure. But "diplomatically fierce" phrasing breaks voice consistency as label rather than action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Template cadence in opening ("He was here not for... but to...") loses momentum. No loops in climax, but "questions left unanswered became destinations paved with steel" paraphrases later motivation with minor redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: textile-guild needle card decoding treaty via solar geometry transforms diplomatic duel trope. Risk-taking (treaty as musical notation) heightens stakes without gimmickry—though mechanical arm edges toward cliché.</comment>
