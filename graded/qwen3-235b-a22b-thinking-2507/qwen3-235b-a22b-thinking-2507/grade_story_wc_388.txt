<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interiority crystallizes through micro-choices: "knelt, brushing radioactive grit" reveals skepticism vs. horror. Final renunciation (leaving diamond) earns cost via prior causality—no diagnostic label-speak in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is Conceptual Repricing: "comfortable lies were a dam" reweights premise with conceptual cost ("deliberate architecture of suffering"). Causal lens holds; cost legible in "trembling hands" and "weight of truth heavier than any stone".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orchard micro-setting constrains choice (moss preserves cylinder, facets sort letters) and charges closure (leaving diamond as "silent witness"). "Resilient moss" and "radioactive grit" filter through Lena’s professional urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Lena’s agency: reassembling letters reveals "Sacrifice acceptable" with visceral cost ("orchard’s quiet hum suddenly deafening"). Tightening forecloses naive truth-seeking via conceptual reweighting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "Sacrifice acceptable" ledger vs. "miracle" orchard; final image ("carrying excavation of truth into light") reweights lies without moralizing. Avoids false equivalence—corporate betrayal is unambiguous.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature sharpens under pressure: "observant eyes catching unnatural stillness" evolves to "repeated phrase chilling in its clarity". Rhythm modulates from clinical ("adjusted respirator") to fractured horror ("Hour bled into hour. Names emerged").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("impossibly green and heavy with fruit" does triple duty). Final beat crystallizes: "weight of truth heavier than any stone" avoids figurative muddle. Strategic telling compresses liquidation backstory without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "cursed artifact" trope: diamond’s flaw enables terraforming, not magic. Emotional specificity in Lena’s quiet horror avoids rebellion clichés. "Sacrifice acceptable" ledger grounds moral calculus in verifiable detail.</comment>
