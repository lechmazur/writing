<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("cheerful gloom") drives micro-choices under pressure; tears/smile at revelation shows embodied conflict. No diagnostic labels, but moral ambiguity lacks deeper flaw exploration beyond surface melancholy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with visceral cost in "tears pricked...but she smiled"; meteor revelation reconfigures path disappearance with conceptual weight. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via seed-emotion density building to iridescent resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal geode constrains choices (seeds roll into light-pooled crevices) and charges final image ("iridescence softened...twilight glow"). Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: crisis narrows to glass hues while calmer moments admit opalescent veins.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via "mere hours before memory faded" countdown; seed discoveries narrow options from hope (amber) to grief (milky white). Cost legible in bittersweet tears/smile trade-off, though cataclysm revelation slightly over-resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through "paths disappeared...when the world itself fractured" revelation; final image ("seeds waiting to be found") reweights loss as continuity without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite poetic density.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "crystalline dust," "singing crystals"; rhythmic control during seed-testing beats. Slight register drift in "conjectured" vs. "murmured," but compression taught early via "tattered sea-foam scrolls" foreshadowing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density ("pulsed faintly violet—a sign of fading remembrance"), but "heart humming with cheerful gloom" risks oxymoronic cliché in peak beat. Final line’s "missing pieces finally whole" slightly over-tells closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "lost path" trope via emotion-translating glass and seed anchors; "cheerful gloom" synthesizes melancholy/hope into memorable lens. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though sky-sparrow borders on convenient.</comment>
