<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation ("capture a spark before oblivion") is concrete and drives every micro-choice, but lacks contradictory impulses in peak beats; embodied grief ("fingers trembled only with urgency") elevates beyond stock archetypes yet internal conflict remains singularly focused.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("earth’s lights winked out... chip cradled in her hands"); orientation anchors ("skyborne grotto," "aurora bled emerald") by line 3; accumulative lens holds via static-pattern escalation narrowing options to one decisive infusion moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Skyborne grotto’s crystalline walls directly constrain the climax (reflecting aurora during infusion), while the emerald chip functions as micro-setting that charges the final image; sensory specificity ("crushed moon-bloom," "static of a planet shedding energy") shapes every tactical choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve life’s spark before oblivion) tightens via Elara’s static-pattern detection, creating one meaningful escalation that forecloses all options except precise timing; cost is visceral ("earth’s lights winked out one by one") but agency lacks competing goods in the final trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action (infusing chaos into stone), avoiding moralizing; final image ("spark burned eternal... testament woven from stillness and starlight") reweights oblivion with conceptual cost without stated morals, though "preserved its soul" borders on abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("listening to raw chaotic hiss beneath aurora") reflects her mortician focus; rhythmic control intensifies under pressure ("Now. With surgical precision..."); no POV drift, though "lucidly watchful" slightly over-articulates her state.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("three-beat cadence like a heartbeat underwater" compresses entropy into actionable rhythm); minor register drift in "infusing hope into the endless night" risks sentimentality but saved by preceding concrete imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mortician ritual with cosmic stakes transforms tropes; "beautician mortician" specificity and static-pattern method feel inevitable; risk-taking heightens coherence without gimmickry, though "soul’s final breath" echoes familiar motifs slightly.</comment>
