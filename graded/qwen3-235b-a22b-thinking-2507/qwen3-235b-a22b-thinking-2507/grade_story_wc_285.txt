<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Silas’ spindrift calm versus visceral tension; embodied emotion via rope’s fraying fibers and needle work. Final mending choice distills motivation without tidy resolution. Minor flaw: blind spot in ritual reliance isn’t tested under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with palpable cost: mended rope’s fragility and passengers’ silent gratitude. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory escalation to fog lift. Gutters’ ticking resolution slightly over-manages time pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fog and river actively constrain choices (drift toward mudflats), while needle mending charges the final image. Micro-setting mastery: rope’s fraying fibers dictate tactics. Rain’s percussion evolves with emotional cadence without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safe passage) tightens through river’s shifting pulse and rope failure. Agency-driven escalation: needle mending forecloses disaster with visible cost. Gutters’ ticking as time pressure feels slightly imposed rather than organically emergent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions—needle mending as distillation of complexity—not abstraction. Final image reweights "palimpsest promise" without moralizing. Young woman’s silent gratitude offers resonant, non-literal answer to endurance’s cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: Silas’ ambient awareness filters fog/chill through river-rhythm expertise. Rhythmic control mirrors tension (short phrases during drift). Slight register drift in "percolate through ambient awareness" jars mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; high density where "waxed thread already threaded" compresses history into action. Final image’s "spindrift serenity settling" risks slight abstraction but saved by tactile needle reference. No closure-adjacent artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of coachman’s craft with existential mending avoids trope. Fog-bound crossing feels specific through rope physics and gutter sounds. Risk-taking in quiet climax earns +0.3; avoids safety middle via earned fragility of "spindrift serenity".</comment>
