<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Kai’s isolation versus shared grief realization; embodied emotion via porcelain box handling avoids therapy-speak. Final choice earned through scarred hands’ micro-choices, though reflection density slightly overshadows present tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: "scars felt different... etched lessons" crystallizes stance shift. Accumulative lens holds through memory density, but celestial timeframe’s vagueness risks orientation drift pre-midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Moonlit ridge path constrains choice—Kai’s descent begins only after epiphany on the boulder. Charred valley’s skeletal trees mirror internal state, charging the final image where moonlight becomes "witness" not judge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation via deepening: each memory (glued dollhouse, evacuation lie) tightens emotional pressure until "pain wasn’t his alone" realization. Cost unmistakable in scars reweighted as "etched lessons," though single reversal pushes scope limits.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through porcelain box’s reframed meaning: "vessel for hard-won wisdom" avoids moralizing. Final image’s "hard softness" offers resonant answer to loss/grief without abstraction, rejecting simplistic binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels—firefighter notices textures (knuckle scars, porcelain seam). Rhythmic control shifts from lyrical reflection to clipped epiphany ("Enlightenment didn’t arrive as a shout"). Minor cadence repetition in middle beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "moonlight glinted through hairline fracture" does triple duty. Final line’s rhythm crystallizes shift, though "pain... isolating, a burden" borders on tell. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms firefighter trope via porcelain box’s specificity—lavender scent, fairy painting. "Hard softness" synthesizes grief/hope uniquely; no derivative echoes. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
