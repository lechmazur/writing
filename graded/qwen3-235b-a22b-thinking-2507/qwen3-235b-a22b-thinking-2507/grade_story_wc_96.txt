<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("anxious librarian" vs "bolder, sharper" Architect) embodied in physical choices like scattering papers. Mateo flashback anchors present via coffee tin micro-choice. Near-label "monthly molt" slightly weakens embodiment but cost of borrowed courage earns closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: scattering papers crystallizes "luminous fracture" with conceptual cost of "borrowed courage" outlasting Elias. Accumulative lens holds—density builds through rust/crumbles motif reweighted by final image. Cost legible in "seed that would outlast his borrowed courage."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rusted library constrains every choice (hiding tin, scattering point) and charges closure via "rust remembers iron" motif. Micro-setting (coffee tin) essential to tactics. Final "luminous fracture" against "oppressive dark" makes environment indispensable for thematic cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (spreading resistance) tightens as verse shifts from "hiding" to "call to rebuild... in action." Agency in scattering papers forecloses passive resistance with visible cost (vulnerability to authorities). Pressure coheres via city's tension vibrating through beams under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: rebuilding poetry section becomes scattering "seeds." Final image reweights "beauty from anarchy" as "luminous fracture" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; "welders" and "rust remembers iron" offer resonant, non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("liquid silver," "skeletal shelves") modulates rhythm under pressure—short sentences during verse-writing. Voice stays within Elias's lexicon; no POV drift. Moonlight "spilling" and "wind-whipped plaza" teach pattern early, paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "whispered truths meant to crack the city's enforced silence" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Figurative language serves meaning ("rust remembers iron"). Final line "luminous fracture of hope" crystallizes theme without muddle. One near-duplicate ("rusted library") prevents 9.6.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms resistance trope via vagrant poet's coffee tin and monthly persona shifts. Emotional specificity in "borrowed courage" avoids generic templates. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes, but "monthly molt" concept lacks full integration, capping near 9.0.</comment>
