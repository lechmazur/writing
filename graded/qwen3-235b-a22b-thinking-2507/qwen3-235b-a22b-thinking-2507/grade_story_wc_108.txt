<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Maya's contradictory impulses—fear vs. adaptive resolve—act simultaneously in decoding scenes; her final choice to send evidence earns rebirth through prior causality (cast as proof, cipher breakthrough) with visceral cost (aquaphobia confrontation).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change: filming/send sequence forecloses silence with felt cost (aquaphobia endured while trembling hands film); causal lens holds perfectly—decoding directly enables exposure, no coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cast constrains movement but enables proof; seashell charges final image ("glowing in recording," "warm against palm"); library's moonlit marble becomes filming surface—micro-setting actively shapes climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Maya's agency: cipher breakthrough transforms smudges into actionable evidence, narrowing options to exposure; cost is unmistakable in trembling-hands filming amid phobia resurgence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally: "vulnerability as power" reweights via cast/seashell as weapons; final image ("trembling felt like strength") resonates without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: stunt-pro mind notices harness details; rhythm shifts from fragmented panic ("Water from trembling hands") to lyrical resolve; zero head-hopping, voice stays within Maya's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("sob caught between terror and triumph" compresses emotion); metaphors precise ("truth thrived in cracks of perfection"); final line avoids cliché through concrete setting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: aquaphobia-stunt double profession isn't trope but causal engine; cipher-on-child's-cast transforms betrayal into rebirth; risk-taking (vulnerability as weapon) heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
