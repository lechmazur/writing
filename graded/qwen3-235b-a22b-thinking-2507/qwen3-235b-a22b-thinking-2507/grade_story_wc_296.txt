<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Kael's "warlike serenity" masking shame; the frozen confession's shattering crystallizes earned renunciation with visceral cost ("weight lighter now"). Slight abstraction in "unspoken guilt" prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: ice shards revealing history reweights the mirror premise with undeniable social cost. Orientation clear by line 3; Accumulative lens holds through vortex stillness. Vine's hunger slightly convenient but doesn't fracture causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The orchard vortex actively constrains choices (currents swallowing light, branches whipping) and charges the final image with blossoms "drifting like snow." Environment dictates tactics from wading to ice-shard rain—no postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by Kael's agency: each expanding circle tightens resistance, narrowing options until the vine forces the path. Cost is unmistakable in the ice shard reflections of the child drowning—a felt conceptual price that reconfigures the curse's root.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through shards of ice showing history, not moralizing. Final line ("some truths... stopped hiding") resonates as non-literal answer to "what mirrors don't show," avoiding thematic echo while charging closure with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("branches snapping like brittle bones," "scent of decayed petals and hunger"). Rhythmic control modulates under pressure—short sentences for action, denser prose for reflection. Slight repetition of "warlike serenity" (lines 5, 45) costs 0.3.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion flawless ("He plucked it from the mud, its cold weight a grim comfort"). One borderline metaphor ("hunger" as scent) in high-pressure beat avoids muddle by linking to seed's nature. Final line’s cadence perfect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms tropes: flesh-eating seed isn't a tool but thematic engine (devours lies), and vortex embodies hidden guilt. Risk-taking in Conceptual Repricing closure feels inevitable—specific theft-to-village-salvation detail prevents genericness.</comment>
