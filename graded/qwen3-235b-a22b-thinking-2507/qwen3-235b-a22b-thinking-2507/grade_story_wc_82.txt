<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in hollow cranes vs active polishing, but "luminous torment" label in peak beats triggers diagnostic-speak penalty; embodied grief in trembling hands and tears saves from deeper deduction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost ("tears scalding cheeks," soul dragging through earth); Accumulative lens holds via sensory density buildup to lantern transformation. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting (geode's grit, lantern frame) constrains choice during polishing; tea garden's plum blossoms charge final image. Slightly generic "jade ponds" prevent 8.5+ despite strong integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: polishing intensifies sensation until shadow detachment becomes bearable. Cost legible in physical/emotional toll ("knuckles white," soul dragging earth") under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "folded hope" crane vs hollow predecessors; avoids moralizing. Near-miss with "same spectrum" abstraction, but earned by concrete struggle and final lantern's duality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (tactile focus: "gritty stone," "knuckles white") with rhythmic control. "Luminous torment" label breaks voice consistency in high-pressure beats, blocking 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless density and propulsion; "luminous torment" repetition creates minor scaffold (-0.3). No figurative muddle in closure beat, but label appears 3x in high-stress sequences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief alchemy through lantern-making mechanics. Floating island risks trope reliance but specificity (geode polishing, shadow detachment) transforms it into authentic emotional logic.</comment>
