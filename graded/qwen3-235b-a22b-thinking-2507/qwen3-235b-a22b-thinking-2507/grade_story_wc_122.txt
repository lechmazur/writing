<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s numbness manifests in concrete tactile details ("defeat tasted like dust," "rhythms flat against her skin") with contradictory impulses (discarding vs. repurposing the needle) driving her pivotal choice. Silas’ silent arrival and shared vibration experience deepen the relationship crucible without dialogue, embodying emotional progression through palm-on-wall micro-choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through sensory density ("tactile symphony," "vibrations traveling through stone") culminating in Charged Poise closure where the fractured numbness and shared resonance reconfigure silence’s meaning with palpable cost. Orientation is anchored by "calloused fingers over smooth oak stave" within 50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cavern acoustics actively constrain choices—vibrations travel differently here, enabling the backward-play experiment. The drum shell and phonograph function as micro-settings that charge the final image ("vibrated through bone and stone"), meeting the 9+ gate by reweighting silence as generative space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency: selecting Beethoven’s disc and cranking backward transforms the needle’s limitation into possibility. The "fractured" numbness and Silas’ felt connection constitute visible cost, reweighting the dominant stake (defeating emotional numbness) through tactile reconfiguration under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete action—the "filament of hush" evolves from broken needle to "tapestry of felt sound," answering the central question through vibration rather than moralizing. Final image ("spaces we cannot hear") reweights silence without abstraction, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters all description through vibration/touch ("sound she knew only by the tremor"). Voice modulates under pressure—short phrases during the backward-play experiment ("The machine groaned")—with consistent free indirect style. Zero head-hopping despite dual characters.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "dry leaves skittered... a sound she knew only by the tremor" compresses time without scaffold. Final line’s "spaces we cannot hear" recharges the premise with crystalline clarity. No figurative muddle—every metaphor ("grey fog") serves tactile immediacy in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "deaf musician" trope through backward-play mechanic, making silence generative. Specificity (shellac disc, brass horn) avoids abstraction; the "filament of hush" concept feels inevitable yet fresh. Risky quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
