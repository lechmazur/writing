<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Micro-choices under pressure (tooth placement decision) earned by Hemlock's wisdom; embodied contradiction in "skeptic yet yearning" avoids therapy-speak; Finn's questions provide crucial external pressure on her stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost in "splinters of skepticism dissolve"; Accumulative lens holds through patterned reflections (tooth/ivine/bone) that reweight the cleft; Hemlock's lesson provides essential deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Garden functions as micro-setting charging the final image (tooth in sundial), but spatial choreography lacks proximity pressure during key realizations; body (splinted arm) constrains Finn's actions yet underutilized in mid-scene choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Hemlock's bone-setting metaphor (one meaningful intensification), but pressure remains internal without tangible escalation; cost legible in dissolved skepticism yet lacks physical manifestation beyond wrist fracture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image ("planting seeds in its shadow") offers non-literal answer to forgiveness question; theme emerges from bone-setting metaphor and tooth reprise without moralizing; avoids thematic echo while embracing complexity of "scars" as necessary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "fractured like dropped porcelain" and "nostalgia warming her chest"; rhythmic control shifts from fragmented reflection to fluid closure; minor register drift in "carving a cleft" simile slightly undermines voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density, but "worldview fractured like dropped porcelain" creates slight figurative muddle in high-pressure beat; final line ("planting seeds in its shadow") achieves crystalline propulsion without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms changeling trope through bone-setting metaphor; emotional specificity in "shrewdly innocent" questions avoids generic grief; risk-taking in Conceptual Repricing lands without obscuring clarity.</comment>
