<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("furiously tranquil precision") and embodied emotion ("sweat beading on forehead") reveal simultaneous survival/trauma impulses; final choice to descend earned by timer ritual’s cost—scars as "waypoints" crystallizes prior causality without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "scars were not wounds but waypoints" reconfigures options under Accumulative lens; clouds parting reveals star-strewn sky as stakes reweighted, with "grief thinned to transparency" proving visible cost at the beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Body-as-setting (palm scar, timer’s brass casing) constrains choice (timing strikes) and charges final image: "scars on his hands glowing faintly" directly reweights cartography theme; observatory’s trembling dome actively pressures tactics during storm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: timer resets narrow options from passive waiting to active archaeology of pain; cost legible in "sweat beading on forehead" and grief’s "transparency," tightening under Accumulative lens to foreclose exile’s paralysis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through scar/constellation motif; final line "We are the constellations we survive" reweights prior material without moralizing, embracing complexity (scars as both trauma and guidance) via concrete bodily experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("lightning painting skin in jagged white light") filters all details through astronomer-poet’s bias; rhythmic control under pressure ("One… two… three…") modulates with storm intensity, avoiding head-hopping despite reflective depth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "thinning the dense fog of grief" risks overwriting but earns density by charging emotional transformation; final line’s "salt into starlight" achieves crystalline propulsion without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms trauma tropes through astronomer’s lens: scars mapped as constellations feels inevitable in hindsight; "storm-kissed wonder" risks cliché but gains freshness via precise observatory physics and censored-poet specificity.</comment>
