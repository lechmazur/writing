<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("rigidly enforcing boundaries" vs. longing to "make friends with uncertainty") drives the pivotal choice to transform the pendant; embodied cost in "ache of homesickness now a quiet hum" avoids label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance shift with felt cost ("ache... now a quiet hum"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds as mist motif reweights boundaries from walls to thresholds through sensory accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frozen garden constrains choice (claws scraping frost into constellations) and charges closure ("mist still thick... air felt less like a cage"); sensory specificity ("sharp scent of frozen lavender") filters through Elara’s library-rooted perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation via protagonist’s agency: unearthing pendant forces confrontation with mirrored fear; cost legible in transformed ache ("homesickness now a quiet hum") reconfiguring the dominant stake (uncertainty as enemy vs. transition).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete shift from "boundaries of light" as defensive walls to "thresholds to be tended"; final image ("garden breathed") resonates without moralizing, reweighting uncertainty as generative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "breathed in the cold, interiorizing exteriors—the sharp scent... as pages turning"; rhythmic control under pressure ("dug with claws that scraped frost into fragile constellations") avoids head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor synonym churn ("dimensionally homesick"/"homesickness") and elevated diction ("interiorizing exteriors") in mid-beat slightly dull immediacy, but closure prose ("light, soft as dawn on forgotten parchment") achieves crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Feral library guardian" trope transformed via dimensionally-specific longing and mist-as-transition; emotional truth in embracing uncertainty avoids abstraction, with "foggy lucidity" crystallizing a fresh inflection on liminal spaces.</comment>
