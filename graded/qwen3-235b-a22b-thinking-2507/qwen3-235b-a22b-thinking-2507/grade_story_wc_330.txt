<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority masterfully concrete: calloused fingers, breathing as "intrusion," tears tracking grime. Contradictory impulses (decay vs renewal) drive singing climax without therapy-speak. Only flaw: accident backstory slightly vague though BRR-compliant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly—smile and sanding block crystallize stance shift with cost (vocal vulnerability). Accumulative lens holds: mist density and wind bells tighten pressure toward singing. No causality breaks, but "sun-warmed" smile edges sentimentality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Misting hush and halo fragment constrain choice (singing before chime ends) and charge final image (warm fragment, renewed purpose). Moss/ferns aren't backdrop—they evolve with song’s light. Sensory hierarchy (sound > sight in fog) reflects urgency flawlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silence as emptiness vs possibility) tightens via wind bells' fading chime, forcing singing climax. Cost is visceral: rough voice, tears, emotional exposure. Agency shines, but timeframe pressure slightly mechanical ("signaling narrow window").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: mending wood → mending silence via song. Final image ("possibilities waiting for quiet gleam") reweights misting hush without moralizing. Near-miss: "fertile ground" borders thematic echo but saved by concrete sanding block action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: notices textures (splintered paint, cobwebs as burial shrouds), not sights. Rhythm modulates from hushed mist to resonant hum. No POV drift; "liquid silver" bubbles show pressure-heightened diction without register clash.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density ("whispering gleam" motif earns credit through closure linkage). Minor overwriting: "settling into his bones like fine dust" risks cliché. "Liquid silver" bubbles slightly purple but redeemed by narrative purpose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "magical object" trope via carpenter’s tactile POV—halo fragment requires sound, not sight, to resonate. Emotional specificity (grief in calloused hands) avoids generic templates. Risk-taking (silence as active canvas) heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
