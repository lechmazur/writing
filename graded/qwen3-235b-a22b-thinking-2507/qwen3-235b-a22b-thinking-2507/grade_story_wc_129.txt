<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses (fragile creations vs yearning for belonging) manifest in micro-choices like tracing tags to share stories; the "luminescent ache" evolves from wound to beacon through embodied cost in her trembling declaration. Hemlock’s silent participation lacks tactical impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the reed web’s glow reconfigures kinship as active creation with visible cost (three-day labor, transformed ache), holding the Accumulative/Textural lens. Minor tension loss in the arbor transition slightly undercuts escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Reeds and obsidian arbor directly constrain choices (sculpting material, final dedication site) and charge the closure image—Elara’s web "catching light to cast patterns that danced over every face" crystallizes kinship. Sensory specificity avoids white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: each tag discovery deepens Elara’s community investment, culminating in her risky declaration. Cost is legible in her "tremor" and three-day labor, but the seventh tag’s transition lacks pressure coherence under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: kinship as "built, tag by tag" reweights the "luminescent ache" into growth without moralizing. Final image of dancing light patterns offers non-literal answer to belonging, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("prismatic shards," "crater’s murmur") modulates with emotional intensity; free indirect style ("she understood then") avoids filter verbs. Minor psychic distance shift when describing community’s "faces soft with understanding."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with zero loops; "breaths forming a single cloud" risks cliché but "luminescent ache now a beacon" avoids overwriting. Slight redundancy in "heart full yet tender" and "ache of growth" dilutes final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "search for artist" trope through specific, organic reveals (Weaver as community); emotional truth in "boldly sympathetic" action. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
