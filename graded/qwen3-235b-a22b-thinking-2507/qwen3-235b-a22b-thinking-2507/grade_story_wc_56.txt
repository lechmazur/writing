<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—chasing magic while blind to human hands shaping myth—drives her micro-choices (kneeling, tracing inscription), but "thoughtfully clear precision" risks clinical phrasing. Motivation crystallizes via embodied cost: "shattered illusions" in the canal muck.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "calm understanding rising within the storm of shattered illusions" reconfigures stakes with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds throughout, but radio’s role in escalation feels slightly under-pressured until late revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The canal’s altered route directly constrains choice (exposing falsified surveys), and the sundial’s bent gnomon charges the final image ("its weight anchored her"). Sensory details ("lap of slow barges," tarnished brass) are purposefully filtered through Elara’s surveyor-trained gaze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elara’s agency: "doubt now gnawed" tightens into dismantling the lie brick by brick. Cost is legible in "shattered illusions" and "peaceful resolve," but the radio’s pressure arrives late, slightly diluting escalation’s causal momentum.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the bent gnomon as distorted truth—not moralizing. Final image ("mind hummed with rebuilding understanding") reweights the quest without stating a moral, avoiding thematic echo through visceral stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("silted edges held relics," Latin inscription), but "hindsight clarity flooded her" verges on clinical phrasing. Rhythmic control under pressure is exceptional, though minor register drift occurs in peak realization beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("salvaging deception"/"unearthing deception") and repeated "thoughtfully clear" phrases dull immediacy. Final image ("mind hummed") compensates, but scaffold in mid-beats prevents 8.8+ eligibility per high-band gate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "quest for truth" trope via media’s role in obfuscation; the mundane sundial as fraud symbol feels inevitable. Specificity ("Horas Non Numero Nisi Serenas") grounds universals, avoiding derivative premise through Elara’s surveyor-trained perspective.</comment>
