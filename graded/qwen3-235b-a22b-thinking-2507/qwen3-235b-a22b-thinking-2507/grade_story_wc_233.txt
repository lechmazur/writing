<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied contradiction ("disenchanted heart beat hollow rhythm") and micro-choices under pressure; transformation from weariness to will-shaping is earned by Lyra memory without diagnostic labels. Final renunciation of passivity carries visible cost in dizziness/starlight pools.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: starlight pools "cold as forgotten graves" lapping at boots, dizziness overcome through will. Causal lens holds tightly—Lyra memory directly fuels command that seals the wound, reconfiguring stakes with conceptual cost in final "fragile peace."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt grotto constrains choice (cold pools lapping at boots forcing stance) and charges closure; "bleeding starlight" viscosity as "molten mercury" directly shapes tactics. Micro-setting mastery—environment’s physicality ("cobalt crystals vibrating") alters final image’s weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (stop celestial hemorrhage) escalates causally: dreams revealed as grotto’s memory narrow options to mending, not fleeing. Cost is visceral—starlight pools’ grave-cold forcing dizziness—resolved through agency ("Enough" command), not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through charged reprise: opening "crowns felt like lead" reweighted by closing "carrying sky’s fragile peace" without moralizing. Final image answers central question (can disenchanted ruler heal?) via embodied cost—she now bears celestial weight as active steward, not passive victim.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: royal lexicon ("endless petitions drowned music") and stress-driven compression ("The climb was brutal...") modulate rhythm. Consistent focalization—no POV leakage; "luminous fireflies" filtered through her dread, not omniscient description.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "viscous strands of silver light oozed" does triple duty (image/tactility/stakes). Minor deduction for "lacy menace" repetition in high-pressure beat; no loops or figurative muddle in closure. Final line recharges opening disenchanted imagery with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "chosen one" trope through specific physicality: starlight as "crystalline poison," fireflies with "metallic scent." Emotional truth in mending via maternal memory—not magic—creates fresh inflection. Avoids abstraction; "cobalt grotto" specificity grounds cosmic stakes.</comment>
