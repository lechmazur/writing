<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to nurture wonder avoids clinical tropes, but Leo's anxiety resolution lacks contradictory impulses; his "chronic anxiety" vanishing via one flute note feels unearned despite embodied tremors early on.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully when Leo declares "It wasn’t dying," reconfiguring the eclipse with visible cost (rigid posture softening), though the baby hair curl’s role strains causality in the climax beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sage Ridge functions as micro-setting—the ridge’s "hush" and penumbral light directly constrain choices, but the final birdsong image lacks the specificity to charge closure as strongly as the curl or flute.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes (wonder vs. anxiety) tighten as the eclipse deepens, yet escalation relies too heavily on the eclipse itself as coincidence; Elara’s agency in "softly adaptive" choices feels passive during the pivotal shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars like the curl’s "question mark" spiral, but the lullaby-humming finale ("wonder could outlast any eclipse") veers into thematic echo, nearly triggering final-paragraph penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "roots whispering secrets" and flute-as-"water finding its path," though Leo’s dialogue lacks age-appropriate voice, sounding equally poetic as Elara’s under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High textural density falters in the climax: adjacent lines ("melody’s gentle insistence"/"world turned penumbral") create paraphrase loops, and "she felt the shift" dilutes immediacy with filter verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "ordinary magic" through tangible objects (curl, sage sprig) avoids cliché, yet the eclipse’s "sun hiding" revelation feels derivative despite emotional authenticity in Leo’s transformation.</comment>
