<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Silas's motivation ("whispers travel farther than shouts") is embodied through concrete micro-choices: mimicking gaits, pebble flick, and flow-based movement. Contradictory impulses (urgency vs. quiet precision) act simultaneously during Rourke encounter. Final coin placement earns his belief with visible physical cost (thigh pressure, humming metal).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly: coin → map → path → obstacles → delivery. Closure (coin placement triggering message) delivers conceptual cost—proving port's vulnerability to silent threats. Storm intensifies radio failure, tightening options meaningfully. No causality breaks; cost legible in Silas's strained physicality throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shipping containers constrain choices: sound absorption enables stealth, humming metal demands tactile navigation. Key-as-compass and map's bioluminescent ink directly charge the final image. Storm isn't generic—it disables radios while activating the map, making setting inseparable from tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deliver coin by dawn) escalates through Silas's agency: storm worsens radio failure, Overseer Rourke appears. Cost is visceral—thigh pressure from coin, humming metal beneath palms. Each solution (pebble flick, gait mimicry) narrows options under causal pressure without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Whispers > shouts" emerges solely through action: shouts swallowed by wind, whispers succeeding via map folds. Final image ("quiet truths traveled farthest") reweights the premise with conceptual cost—the port's security proven fragile despite crimson aurora. Zero moralizing; theme lives in concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("body calibrated to rhythms," "study in calculated spontaneity") modulates under pressure. Rhythm shifts precisely: clipped sentences during Rourke encounter, fluid prose during map navigation. Zero head-hopping; voice remains anchored to Silas's occupational expertise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("faint scuffs on damp concrete" shows stealth without telling). Figurative language sparse but precise ("metal skins vibrating like colossal tuning forks"). Final line crystallizes theme without overwriting—pure propulsion with no muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of port labyrinth + geomagnetic storm + zodiac puzzles transforms "quiet vs loud" trope. Occupational specificity (maintenance maps, crane operator mimicry) grounds risk-taking. Conceptual integrity in every choice serving the core premise—no safety-hedging, pure commitment to the whisper logic.</comment>
