<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied micro-choices (kneeling in mud, clutching shard), but the shift from grief to purpose occurs too abruptly without sufficient struggle against her grandfather's protective silence during the photo discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully—the "weight of the past lift" crystallizes Elara’s stance with conceptual cost—but the biscuit tin discovery relies on convenient backstory access rather than earned causality under the accumulative/textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sapphire shard evolves from artifact to emotional anchor, constraining Elara’s final choice as it "warms in her pocket," while the ridgeway’s mud and chimes actively shape her tactile, decaying journey toward truth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen organically from physical vigilance to emotional burden, but the photos' sudden revelation of the aunt feels coincidental rather than pressured by Elara’s agency, slightly diluting the cost of confronting inherited grief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment>Theme emerges through visceral particulars (shard warmth, drying mud), avoiding moralizing; the final walk reweights "precisely humane" as shared remembrance without stating it, though Silas’s omitted guilt edges toward over-explained backstory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is immaculate—"boots sinking," "scent of wet earth"—with rhythm tightening under stress; the "bruised twilight sky" simile risks cliché but is redeemed by immediate grounding in tangible decay.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "warped floorboards" and "rusted biscuit tin" exemplify textural specificity, though "profound, mirrored hush" slightly strains coherence by echoing the final line without sufficient evolution in the beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms the drowned-town trope through the sapphire shard’s emotional specificity and the bold quiet closure, but "precisely humane" risks abstraction without deeper exploration of Silas’s moral calculus in the photos.</comment>
