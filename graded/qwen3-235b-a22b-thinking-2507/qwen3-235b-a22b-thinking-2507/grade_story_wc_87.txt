<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("merrily melancholic") and embodied regret anchor choices, but "backlash of regrets" veers toward therapy-speak in high-pressure beats, slightly undermining visceral authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (reaching for phone) lands with conceptual cost, yet ambiguous Accumulative/Situational lens at midpoint risks coherence; sun-gilding poles reweights stakes without causal resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Utility poles function as micro-setting that constrains navigation tactics and charges the final image, though coastal launch remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Regret-driven escalation narrows options to "call or drift," but protagonist passivity until climax weakens agency; utility poles deepen stakes yet lack tangible cost beyond emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of presence vs. pursuit emerges through compass/utility pole contrast without moralizing; final image ("just beginning") resonates through concrete action, avoiding abstract sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("utility poles marched like crooked teeth") and rhythmic control shine, but "merrily melancholic" repetition dilutes tension during peak regret beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Scaffold loops ("flickering faith" x2, "merrily melancholic" x3) slightly blunt closure momentum; compass sinking delivers visceral propulsion though lyrical density risks overwriting in reflection beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms "absent father" trope via specific navigator-to-utility-pole shift, but emotional arc leans on familiar beats; risk-taking in Accumulative structure elevates without gimmickry.</comment>
