<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strength: Contradictory impulses shine in "staggering grace" during collapse. Weakness: "her motivation burned clear" uses label-language violating embodied emotion rule, costing 0.4 in peak pressure moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is masterful Charged Poise—chains anchoring seeds as ceiling falls makes conceptual cost undeniable. Minor thematic echo ("liberation she sought wasn't for herself") slightly dilutes causality but doesn't breach closure integrity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival isn't backdrop but active constraint: prize counter anchors chains, piano bench enables solution. Final image of chains in soil charges closure, satisfying 9+ gate requirement for micro-setting shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Wall collapse tightens options relentlessly under Accumulative lens; "minutes, perhaps seconds" creates visceral clock. Agency-driven escalation (decoding, planting) with visible cost (her death) meets 9+ quick test for unmistakable on-page price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: "soil remembered how to dream" reweights seeds as resilience without moralizing. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer to "can hope survive war?" avoiding all anti-patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: "air tasted of smoke and surrender" filters world through her urgency. Rhythmic compression during collapse ("She had minutes, perhaps seconds") shows masterful control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless prose but paraphrase loop: "chains clinked... chains scraping... chains tangling" repeats without added pressure. Minor scaffold ("patiently strategic, she ignored the ache") deducts 0.3, avoided in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "seed vault" trope through carnival decay specificity; jewel beetle arrow's irreplaceable properties (projecting spectral keys) create fresh inflection. Risk-taking (quiet ending) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
