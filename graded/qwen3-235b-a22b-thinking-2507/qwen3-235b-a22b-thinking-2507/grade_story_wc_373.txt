<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority shines through tactile watch fob use and embodied stress ("fingers trembling"), but "curiously steadfast" remains stated rather than earned through contradictory impulses during pivotal false starts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "hollow victory" crystallizes conceptual cost of capturing betrayal while sunrise ends the truce, fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens through pattern-breaking fracture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Salt-crusted environment charges final image ("pier's rot" vs. "purpose held"), while the watch fob's frozen time (3:07) actively constrains her tactics as dawn approaches.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten relentlessly via sunrise deadline; each thwarted violence (oyster basket, smuggled pistols) visibly wastes time, altering her recording tactics with visceral cost in the horizon's "pale light".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete sound-capture mission; final line "sound of betrayal was hers to keep" resonates as non-literal answer to trust's fragility without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("brine and decay, a comforting unease"), but "curiously steadfast" phrasing briefly drifts into authorial voice during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops in peak beats, yet "hollow victory" edges toward abstraction where embodied detail could heighten cost; otherwise exemplary density ("bottle shattered, sharp and final").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of phonograph-as-emotional-archaeology transforms familiar revenge trope; specificity of wax cylinder recording makes betrayal's sound universally resonant.</comment>
