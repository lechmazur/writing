<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via embodied choices (rejecting sentiment while seeking neural cure), but "involuntary truth compulsion" borders on diagnostic label-speak in peak stress, risking the -0.4 penalty. Final renunciation of psychic noise earns stakes through prior causality with Hemlock's collapse as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands decisively: "psychological safety wasn't silence" crystallizes stance with undeniable cost (Hemlock's tears, intensified truth compulsion). Hybrid lens (causal ritual + accumulative psychic clearing) holds, though Codex references slightly strain causality at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ravine functions as active constraint—river carving earth mirrors psychic fracture, slippery roots pressure truffle hunt. Glass eye as micro-setting charges final image ("cool against skin"), fulfilling 9+ gate by concretely shaping the closure's "fractured grace" revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: pressing glass/truffle narrows options (silence gained, empathy altered), with Hemlock's emotional collapse as visceral cost. Escalation driven by Elara's choice meets Hybrid lens requirements, though virus aftermath lacks temporal urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Hemlock's reaction—"space where truth could be borne" reweights "fractured grace" without moralizing. Final orchard image ("battered yet enduring") offers resonant, non-literal answer to psychological safety, avoiding thematic echo despite phrase repetition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("rational mind cataloging storm-scoured cliffs") modulates under pressure, but clinical diction ("involuntary truth compulsion") clashes with voice in peak beats. Consistent psychic distance avoids head-hopping, though Hemlock's introduction slightly disrupts focalization flow.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "psychic static" is sole figurative muddle in high-pressure beat but doesn't obscure closure. Propulsion maintained through concrete verbs ("chilled her skin," "lanced through skull"), with final line ("scent of wet earth and healing") avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of empathy tropes via neural-regenerative truffles and ocular prosthetics. "Empathy Virus" world rules transform genre conventions, though glass eye concept edges near trope without deeper reinvention. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
