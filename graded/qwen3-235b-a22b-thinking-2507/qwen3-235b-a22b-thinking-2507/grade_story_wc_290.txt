<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied ("chest squeezed tighter") but "wistful rebellion surged" edges into label-heavy abstraction during pivotal sacrifice reflection, slightly undermining earned contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Conceptual Repricing (mutinies born of longing) with felt cost, but organ-triggered mutiny pause lacks causal agency—resolution hinges on coincidence rather than protagonist-driven escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Blueprint compass functions as micro-setting: constrains choices (tracing key in silt) and charges final image ("pressed into satchel"), meeting 9+ gate requirement through tactical necessity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake tightens meaningfully when compass settles on resonance, but escalation falters as organ vibration (external force) resolves spatial mutiny without Elara's agency, violating "coincidence may complicate not resolve" rule.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image ("land’s wistful cry echoed in her bones") delivers non-literal answer to "can tools fix longing?" through concrete particulars (organ’s mournful melody), avoiding moralizing while reweighting premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("measured angles in spaces that defied Euclid") and rhythmic control under pressure (shortened syntax during panic) showcase voice mastery, though "wistful rebellion surged" slightly disrupts flow.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density ("shadows pooled like spilled ink") with zero loops; minor scaffold in "prudently adventurous explorer" tells rather than shows trait but avoids closure-adjacent artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny transformed into embodied longing elevates trope, but "starving children" motivation lacks freshness; emotional specificity ("hollow victory") compensates for conventional setup.</comment>
