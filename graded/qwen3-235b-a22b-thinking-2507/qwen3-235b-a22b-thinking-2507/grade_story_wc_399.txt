<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority masterfully embodied through sensory perception ("felt the kinetic parapet," "felt the clearing's fear") avoiding therapy-speak; contradictory impulses (honoring duty vs. exhaustion) culminate in earned endurance with visible cost in the final mask-hiding detail.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost (wisdom preservation requiring bodily sacrifice); Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Textural dominant at closure) holds as density increase ("cool air, amplified silence") reweights the desert's entropy with tangible cost in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: kinetic parapet's tectonic sigh and worn boots constrain choices throughout; the half-mask charges the final image by hiding exhaustion, making the environment's physicality inseparable from thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's breath-alignment with the parapet's pulse, transforming threat into foundation; visible cost (exhaustion etched around eyes) forecloses easy preservation, crystallizing her stance under accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "conjured clearing" mechanics rather than moralizing; final image ("desert's whisperfield calm now holding a new, enduring truth") reweights unity/cost of forgetting as lived resonance without abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "sand grains hesitate in their fall" and "tectonic sigh," with rhythmic control shifting from lyrical ("murmuring pavilion vibrating") to sparse urgency ("Hold."); no head-hopping despite profound interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; every line propels ("kinetic parapet shifted, a deep, resonant *thrum*"); metaphors serve pressure ("fragile resonance," "echo settled like dew") without muddle even in high-stakes consecration beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids spiritual cliché through specific mechanics (peripheral awareness guiding tectonic energy); transforms desert mysticism via tangible constraints (parapet's groans threatening entropy), though "prophet" concept edges toward template without deeper subversion.</comment>
