<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak; "weight of countless unshed tears" embodies emotion concretely. But "spiralingly calm" lacks contradictory impulses in peak action—trait stated not tested under pressure during light-weaving climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: shutters closing after radiant star image crystallizes cost ("silent promise carried on stillwater tension"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via patterned light-weaving reweighting darkness with tangible hope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cobalt dock's rain-slicked stone and dental mirror function as micro-setting—concrete constraints enabling the light method. Final image charges closure as "echo of the pattern" makes environment inseparable from emotional shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via light-pattern density ("geometric shapes bloomed"), but escalation lacks visible cost on guardian. Child's transformation is earned, yet guardian's "weight of unshed tears" remains abstract rather than altering her tactics mid-beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</comment><comment>Theme emerges through "darkness not its end, but its adornment"—resonant without moralizing. Final line ("secret now fully known") reweights "half-spoken secret" through action, avoiding abstraction while embracing complexity of silent witness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "slow water swirling," "soft drip" filter through guardian’s calm. Rhythmic control peaks in shutter sequence ("slashed," "multiplying," "blooming")—lyric compression taught early and paid off in closure’s "woven light" motif.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; "tarnished dental mirror, its handle worn smooth" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor overwriting in "liquid reflection and hushed breath" risks density but earns payoff via closure’s "echo of the pattern" reprise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: dental mirror + shutters transform starlight into tangible hope avoids trope. "Spiralingly calm" trait grounds method, but "teach darkness the value of stars" borders on familiar wisdom without sufficient character-specific reframing.</comment>
