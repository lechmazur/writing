<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation ("appreciate hidden effort") is clear and drives all actions, but lacks contradictory impulses; firefly reflection shows embodied emotion yet micro-choices lack tension—no visible flaw forces mistakes, weakening the "inevitable mistakes" requirement crucial for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation failure: "who/where/when" anchors arrive too late (~180 words), triggering -0.4 penalty; closure (Charged Poise via tea ritual) lands with felt cost, but orientation debt caps high-band eligibility despite strong Accumulative lens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Parapet functions as active micro-setting: water grooves constrain Kenji's testing, moon paths enable discovery, and the final tea ritual charges closure by transforming the stone into a "living canvas"—environment directly shapes tactics and the ending's resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Kenji detects the "wrong" water rhythm, escalating to the whistle-induced resonance; pressure grows through protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, but cost (time/ritual effort) feels minor for the profound revelation, limiting higher-band entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete particulars—net knots, fireflies' metabolic effort, stone harmonics—avoiding abstraction; final image (tea catching light) offers non-literal answer to "hidden effort" without moralizing, achieving earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("calloused fingers tracing crenellations," fireflies as "sorrowful stars") with rhythmic control under pressure; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure, no head-hopping, and "demure audacity" exemplifies voice-motivated diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "stone parapet exhaled cool mist" uses active verbs for texture, zero loops or scaffold; minor overwriting ("scintillatingly somber") in firefly description slightly dilutes density but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: net-mender's tactile expertise transforms moonlight into pattern-revealing tool (bamboo whisk), avoiding abstraction; risk-taking (Accumulative lens for philosophical theme) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
