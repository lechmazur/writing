<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her scientific rigor versus craving quiet; embodied epiphany through dust mapping avoids therapy-speak. "Profound humility kindle within her" slightly edges toward label, but "warm and steady" saves embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "weight of forced narratives lifting" crystallizes earned renunciation of spectacle with conceptual cost. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds from first dust mote to final "truth written plainly in the dust."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Greenhouse debris actively constrains choices (mud-caked benches force kneeling, broken roof leaks rain for dust patterns). Recurring dust motes charge the final image as "compass pointing toward patience," fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake (rejecting drama for gradual truth) tightens through her dust-mapping agency; conceptual cost of abandoning forced narratives is legible in "weight lifting." One decisive deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through dust accumulation on orchid and neutron stars—zero moralizing. Final image ("truth written plainly in the dust") reweights the premise without stating a moral, dodging Thematic Echo penalties.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "fingers usually tracing radio signatures now brushed iridescent dust" filters world through scientist’s lens. Minor elevation in "profound humility" avoided full 9.0 despite rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats, but adjacent "slow, inevitable dance... slow unspooling... slow accretion" creates subtle synonym loop. High density maintained ("mud-caked benches," "skeletal ruin") without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "scientist finds meaning in nature" trope through dust-as-methodology parallel. Fresh synthesis: neutron star decay and butterfly wing dust as identical physics. Avoids safety middle with uncompromising quiet closure.</comment>
