<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (fear vs redemption) act simultaneously in snow-scraping micro-choices; final "vouchsafe" choice earns closure through prior causality with felt cost in Mara's strained voice and the pillbox's symbolic weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly when codes gleam at sunrise—options reconfigured with conceptual cost (trust earned through risk)—under Accumulative lens, though radio call slightly softens pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pillbox functions as micro-setting: its engraving constrains snow-code method and charges final image ("reminder: even broken things... could mend"), but bluff geography lacks tactical pressure beyond slope angle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake tightening via snow-melting deadline forces Elias's "vouchsafe" agency; cost legible in Mara's eroded trust and his realization that "broken thing... is belief that you're alone," driving conceptual reweighting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pillbox/snow-code particulars; final image offers resonant non-literal answer ("mend" as active courage) without moralizing, avoiding defector's quote becoming thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("silver hush amplifying crunch of snow") modulates rhythm under stress; free indirect style clean with controlled lexicon shifts, no head-hopping despite reflective fragments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor synonym churn ("prudently daring his way back... moving with caution") and slight overwriting in opening ("shivering in pre-dawn chill" vs "winter's grip loosening"), but no closure-impacting artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spy genre via tactile snow codes and paternal redemption; specificity ("Siberian ditches") transforms tropes, though "unused courage" phrase borders on familiar motif without full transformation.</comment>
