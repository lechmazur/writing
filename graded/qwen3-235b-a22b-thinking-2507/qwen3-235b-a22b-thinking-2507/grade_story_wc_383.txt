<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (skepticism vs. ritual participation) drives micro-choices like adjusting lapis orb, but "structured data" phrasing risks therapy-speak; embodied cost lacks specificity beyond tears.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as memory archives and dawn breaks, with felt cost in "isolation dissolving into independence," but the Accumulative lens lacks sufficient pressure escalation beyond sensory density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Garden’s luminescence actively constrains the ritual (petals vibrating at "precise frequency"), charging the final image as "monument to what was lost," though occupational detail exceeds scope needs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through resonance calibration (e.g., lapis orb adjustment), but pressure remains static—memory transformation lacks tangible cost escalation beyond emotional abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "transformation not erasure," crystallized in the final image of the buried seashell, avoiding moralizing despite near-miss with "elegant physics of healing."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinct perceptual signature ("sorrowful luminescence," "ghostly resolve"), but syntactic monotony in ritual sequences ("humming calibrated tones," "adjusting lapis lazuli orb") dulls peak-pressure rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Overwriting plagues high-pressure beats: "structured harmonic sequence," "tragically radiant monument" violate physical logic; synonym churn ("quarantined memory" x7) triggers -0.6 loop penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scientific ritual and grief avoids trope pitfalls, but "resonance structures" feels derivative of common speculative tropes without sufficient transformation through character-specific logic.</comment>
