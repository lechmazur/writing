<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in sister's stolen identity is clear, but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; Lyra's acceptance of "trapped freedom" feels earned yet untested by competing desires earlier in the scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully when Lyra realizes "the solace wasn’t for the ship, but for her," with felt cost in leaving the unkindled solace behind; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through memory-weaving escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Emerald swatch card functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (thinning fog, revealing paths) and charges the final verdant path; saltwater, rotting timbers, and carousel integrate tactilely with pressure.</comment>
