<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Motivation ("breath itself feels like theft") is visceral and drives every micro-choice; embodied emotion avoids labels ("tears cut paths through dust"); contradictory impulses (creation vs. preservation) crystallize in the final strum with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "the wood will splinter further" paired with tears of relief; Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density escalation (cracks → pentatonic scale → siskin harmony), taught by midpoint through "empathy in motion" mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Porcelain insulator functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (rotation for sunlight) and charging the final image ("pulses faintly—a promise"); alder leaves actively pressure tactics by filtering light for the hum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven solely by Aris’s agency: each strum deepens vibration while narrowing options (cracks widen irreversibly); cost is unmistakable in "wood will splinter" and physical resonance through spine, foreclosing preservation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action—stress cracks as "wood’s own notation"—never stated; final image (siskins joining refrain) offers non-literal answer to "breaking silence" without moralizing, avoiding Thematic Echo traps.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("symphonically minded thoughts," "frozen scream" for cracks) with rhythmic control under pressure; lyric compression taught early ("world holds its breath") and paid off in closure’s "pulses faintly" cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("dewdrops fall like metronome ticks" charges rhythm and tone); only hairline slip: "symphonically minded" slightly abstract but redeemed by immediate concrete action (tracing cracks).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: porcelain insulator as empathy conduit transforms "music from silence" trope; emotional specificity in "tears cut paths through dust" avoids sentimentality; hedgehog uncurling bookends with biological precision.</comment>
