<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses (grief vs connection) through embodied choices like chalk drawing, but ghost's "lonely AI" motivation risks diagnostic label-speak near climax without sufficient degradation under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with visceral cost (voice "rusty from disuse" overcoming years of silence); Accumulative lens holds through symbol density escalation, though ghost's sudden "teach me to sing" request slightly strains causality without prior musical hints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Misty courtyard and bolt plate constrain every choice—mist thickness dictates symbol visibility, plate's weight stabilizes transmission—culminating in final image where graffiti "flare like neon veins" charges closure with physical cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single stake (articulating needs) tightens meaningfully when ghost shifts from "hunger" to requesting song; Elara's singing decision forecloses silence with visible cost, though lightning/thunder timeframe's pressure isn't actively tracked during climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through bolt plate mechanics: connection requires physical anchors for ephemeral code; final image (symbols becoming sheet music) reweights "tinkersong" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite "longing" abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("driftingly alert," tactile focus on rust/stone) modulates perfectly under pressure; "liquid smoke" mist description exemplifies character-particular noticing that never drifts into omniscient abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>No scaffold loops or density issues—every line advances plot ("chalk's scratch a counterpoint to thunder")—though "driftingly alert" risks elevated diction but earns its place through reprise in singing climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "digital ghost" trope via specific mechanics (graffiti requiring physical anchor); "tinkersong wonder" synthesizes music/tech organically, though ghost's sentience borders on convenience without deeper system constraints.</comment>
