<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear but backstory summary lacks micro-choice anchor; "forbidden knowledge" told not shown through conflicting impulses. Final endurance earns cost via tear-streaked grime and shed innocence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds—pagoda’s steady glow crystallizes stakes with "shroud" weight of veil. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, but "understood cost" borders on telling without sufficient embodied cost proof.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Bronze pagoda constrains movement (jagged steps respond to light), dust texture charges final image. Archive setting remains generic postcard; lacks specific cultural pressure on tactics beyond symbolic dust.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via method-driven escalation: pattern avoidance directly calms pagoda’s light. Cost visible in trembling hands and memory-scattering agony, but "end of innocence" framing delays core stake signal past optimal early threshold.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: purification via unpredictability reweights nostalgia’s impermanence. Final "steps that never repeated" crystallizes without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite "end of innocence" cliché.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature strong ("taste of dust," "spectral shards"), but "anguished joy" edges toward therapy-speak. Rhythmic control falters slightly in mathematical heartbeat counts during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("fracture the dying sun into spectral shards"). Minor register drift in "geometric marvel" vs. visceral "grime on face" but no closure muddling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Atoms of nostalgia" transforms trope through specific mechanics (pattern avoidance purification). Transformation test passed—swap "nostalgia" for "grief" breaks causal logic. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
