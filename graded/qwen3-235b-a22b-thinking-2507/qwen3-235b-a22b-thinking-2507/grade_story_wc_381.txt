<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses; "tranquil blaze" is diagnostic label-speak replacing embodied struggle. Final choice (guarding haven) lacks earned causality—success feels effortless with no visible character cost beyond sweat. Interiority remains abstractly serene throughout pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure (Earned Stasis) lacks legible cost: "sweat beaded" isn't sufficient sacrifice for world-ending stakes. Accumulative lens holds but pressure dissipates—prophecy strains then vanishes without meaningful resistance. Cost proof test fails; no on-page sentence concretizes price paid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting is lushly rendered ("liquid silence," "moss breathed starlight") but ornamental—brook enables effortless victory without constraining choices. Micro-setting (origami wing) charges closure, but "terrestrially cosmic" remains abstract descriptor rather than tangible constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes ("fractured skies") stay abstract; escalation lacks agency as prophecy hums then dissolves without forcing trade-offs. Sweat and "warmer paper" imply cost but aren't meaningful sacrifices—no tactics altered, no path foreclosed. Pressure resolves through setting (brook flow), not protagonist action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme stated overtly ("smoothed hush," "terrestrially cosmic") rather than earned through action. Final line "prophecy was hushed, not broken" functions as thematic echo—near-moralizing that replaces resonant image with conceptual summary. Lacks non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV stable but voice overwrites with abstract lyricism ("nocturnal haven cradling solitude"). Under pressure, diction doesn't degrade—remains uniformly poetic. "Tranquil blaze" and "terrestrially cosmic" read as committee voice rather than character-specific perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Severe overwriting: "earthbound moss breathed starlight" and "liquid silence" in every sentence create density overload. Final beat's "terrestrially cosmic peace" muddles closure with mixed metaphor (cosmic + terrestrial). Template cadence in high-pressure beats triggers -1.7 artifact cap.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Premise (origami silencing prophecy) has fresh angle but execution feels derivative of mythic fantasy tropes. Emotional complexity absent—no genuine struggle or moral calculus. "Terrestrially cosmic" concept reads as pretentious ornament rather than earned insight, failing transformation test.</comment>
