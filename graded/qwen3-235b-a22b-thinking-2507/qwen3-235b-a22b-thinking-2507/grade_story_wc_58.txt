<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "burden and sacrament" of channeling loss; final revision of Varek's obituary earned through embodied projection (shiver, phantom weight) forecloses avoidance with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "geography wasn’t out there... courage to describe the hollow" reconfigures stakes via accumulative lens; thread’s warmth crystallizes pressure without resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Carpet thread functions as indispensable micro-setting—constrains choice (projection tool) and charges final image ("gleaming like a promise"); decaying apples/woodsmoke anchor sensory urgency to grief’s texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elara’s deepening projection ("summoned Captain Varek... sought the pattern") under accumulative lens; cost legible in shiver and phantom hand, narrowing options to witnessing absence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through obituary revision ("He sails the harbor of his grief")—non-literal answer to "geography of healing" avoids moralizing; lonesome splendor reweighted by mending map in final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct ("leaves mapping silence," "unanswered prayers"); rhythmic control under pressure via fragmented clauses during projection; no head-hopping, voice modulates from clinical to lyrical.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("Each falling leaf a punctuation mark") with crystalline closure image; figurative language ("vein of frozen blood") purposeful without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Emotional cartography transforms grief tropes via Sultan’s carpet logic; specific, verifiable detail (weft thread, Hall of Whispers) avoids generality; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
