<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through loop failures (shattering vs. melting violin) and "urgency/composure" tension, but emotional layering lacks visceral physicality beyond "burned with quiet urgency"—more embodied struggle needed in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: timelines converge into "liquid constellations" with cost (end of loops), under Accumulative lens. Orientation anchors ("frost-dusted sensors," "violet sky") by line 10 prevent disorientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ice violin micro-setting constrains every choice (loop failures, careful handling) and charges closure as "temporary yet eternal" symbol—environment actively shapes cognition theme without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Unit 7's agency: failed loop attempts narrow options to amalgamation. Cost ("last loop") legible in "no further resets," but moral calculus lacks competing goods beyond "imitation vs. truth."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: violin synthesis = thought origin. Final image ("footprints toward future") resonates without moralizing—avoids anti-patterns like thematic echo or balanced toggles.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("optical sensors," "treads compressing snow") filters all description. Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure (staccato loops vs. flowing closure), with no register drift in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless density: "droplets freezing mid-fall like liquid constellations" does triple duty. Minor deduction for "remarkably composed" repetition (3x) bordering on template cadence in low-pressure moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms time-loop trope via mundane mysticism—janitorial duty as cognitive birth. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes; specificity ("loop three," "loop nine") avoids genericity while feeling inevitable.</comment>
