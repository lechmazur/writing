<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("bitterness shattered yet contentment elusive") and embodied emotion ("cradling a scallop") power the arc; micro-choice of harvesting scallops under grief reveals hierarchy of values. No diagnostic label-speak despite high-stakes reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: "she'd been content all along" crystallizes stance with felt cost (sister's betrayal). Accumulative lens holds, but "content all along" slightly over-articulates the epiphany, diminishing earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Umbral grotto functions as micro-setting that charges closure: "cloud-floor" texture shapes Elara's "light" steps, while scallops' "fragile spheres" constrain the ritual. Final image of "grotto’s hush now a song in her bones" reweights environment as embodied theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: scallop harvest narrows options as "dawn" deadline looms. Cost ("broken but sincere" heart-stone return) is legible, but pressure lacks one visceral tightening beat—harvest feels too seamless for the declared stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through scallops' "cyclical dance" mirroring forgiveness; final image ("keeper of light in the umbral cradle") reweights "contentment" without moralizing. "I would teach others this truth" risks thematic echo but escapes penalty via immediate concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("vineyard hush," "pale, pulsing scallops") and rhythmic control under pressure. Hairpin reflections modulate voice without head-hopping; lyric compression taught early pays off in closure’s "warmth spread through the grotto."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "luminescent vines sagged, their glow dimmed" exemplifies high-density propulsion. One borderline purple phrase ("grotto’s hush now a song in her bones") in closure beat costs 0.1 but doesn’t obscure cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis: "sky-scallops gathering starlight" transforms rebirth trope through specific labor ("cradling a scallop"). Risk-taking in Accumulative lens heightens stakes, but "content all along" slightly undermines emotional specificity’s boldness.</comment>
