<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied ("tears pricked not from sorrow but weight of sensation"), contradictions woven through tactile choices. Near-therapeutic phrasing in climax ("fierce, tender core") slightly undermines rawness but cost remains visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: ring warming on heart crystallizes grief's integration. Constellation timeframe tightens options effectively, but Cassiopeia's tilt escalation lacks visceral struggle during critical panic beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest functions as active constraint—bare feet registering E-minor, vibrations etching braille—directly shaping tactics. Final dirt-drawn map charges closure, making environment indispensable to emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Time pressure from thinning constellation pause narrows options meaningfully, but the shift from panic to calm ("breathed it into ground") feels slightly under-earned in the high-stakes C-resonance moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete sensory work (mapping grief as topography), never stated. Final image of sketching "melody’s arc" reweights the quest without moralizing, avoiding sentimentality through tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature masterful: "languages absorbed through skin" filters all description. Rhythm modulates perfectly—compressed during panic ("low C resonated sharp as snapped twig"), lyrical at stillpoint. Zero voice contamination.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose near-flawless: "hollow ache behind ribs" edges toward cliché but redeemed by context. No loops or scaffold; every line propels tension. Figurative language serves pressure without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via ultrasonic mechanics—musical notes as tactile waypoints. "Stillpoint as internal forge" synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh, with specificity (star-metal ring, constellation timing) elevating risk.</comment>
