<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in peak moments; motivation is pure (planting forests) without layered conflict, though embodied emotion in the pawn scene elevates endurance. Micro-choices like cradling hands show value hierarchy but no genuine struggle beyond external pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly—the dawn display crystallizes options with conceptual cost (erased histories made visible), and the Accumulative lens holds through density buildup. Minor transition slip from library to grotto slightly dulls causality, but cost is undeniable in the girl’s transformed fear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Environment constrains choice decisively: the grotto’s magnetism enables the display alignment, and the pawn’s physicality charges the final image. Sensory details ("cobalt-tinted windows swallowing mist like ink") filter through Elara’s bias without static description, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative density (anxieties → grotto planning → dawn execution) narrows options to quiet reclamation, with cost legible in the girl’s melting terror. Stakes could feel more visceral earlier, but the method’s constraints deepen pressure organically under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: the tree-in-stone image answers "Can erased histories take root?" without moralizing. Final resonance ("forests had begun to grow") reweights the premise through concrete particulars, avoiding thematic echo or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("mist cool on her skin" compressing motion/mood), with rhythmic control under pressure (short sentences during display placement). Zero head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during the girl’s approach to heighten intimacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold—every line advances atmosphere or plot ("magnetic grotto’s influence ensuring reflections aligned" does triple duty). Figurative language remains precise ("quiet symphony of doubt"), and final line recharges "forests" motif with crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms rebellion trope through specificity (steam-coded messages, magnetized cards), but emotional truth in the pawn scene avoids quirkiness. Fresh inflection lies in resistance via dawn light, though premise isn’t radically new—strength is in execution, not concept.</comment>
