<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak; embodied contradiction in "blessed pariah" status fuels micro-choices (aligning paper with compass rose). Final endurance earned by tactile ancestral lineage, but contradictory impulses lack simultaneous friction during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Polaris revelation reconfigures exile into purpose with visible cost ("echoed silence deepened... no longer oppressive but reverent"). Accumulative lens holds through density escalation, though lens clarity falters slightly pre-midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gilded compass rose functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (paper alignment) and charges final image. Dust motes, charcoal rustle, and syrupy dawn create sensory hierarchy reflecting urgency, with time dilation physically shaping observational tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve tradition before time dilation fades) tightens via residual thinning "like fog at dawn," driving urgent sketching. Agency-driven escalation crystallizes in Polaris glimpse, but cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized in the beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: compass rose transforms from metaphor to literal anchor. Final image reweights "true north" without moralizing, though grandmother's voice risks bordering on thematic echo ("pulse beneath the noise").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("minutes stretched into hours and the sky bled") with rhythmic control under pressure. Elision of shutdown mechanics taught early via "residual time dilation lingered," paid off in Polaris revelation without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in "dissolved into purpose" triggers label-slip penalty. Otherwise, high density with concrete propulsion ("charcoal met paper, a sudden glint caught her eye"), though final paragraph slightly dilutes momentum with reflection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time dilation and astronomical tradition avoids genre clichés. Risk-taking in using compass rose as literal lens for Polaris elevates stakes, though "temporally stretched" concept leans on familiar physics without unique transformation.</comment>
