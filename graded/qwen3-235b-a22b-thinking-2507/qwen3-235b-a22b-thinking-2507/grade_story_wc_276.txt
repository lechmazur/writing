<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied in rail spike vibrations ("calm fear became a low thrum"), but "motivation burned steady" edges toward label-speak. Contradictory impulses shine during zigzag survival dance, though village stakes lean slightly told despite basin infusion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully with "first true silence settling like snow" carrying conceptual cost. Orientation anchors by word 10. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through pattern breaks, though dissonance-to-harmony shift lacks one tightening beat in the fracture phase.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sound wave garden functions as active constraint: sonic lilies' vibrations dictate movement, shattered sound shards become physical obstacles. Rail spike as micro-setting charges closure through its "iron heart" holding the echo, directly shaping tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring lullabies) tightens via cosmic dissonance narrowing Kael's options to zigzag survival. Cost legible in basin infusion of "mothers' exhaustion," but universe's "yawning" pattern-break feels coincidental rather than protagonist-driven escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "feral lullaby" synthesis—wild yet soothing echo embodying broken-world healing. Final silence reweights prior "stolen sleep" without moralizing. Avoids allegory pitfalls by grounding goddess echo in marrow-deep vibration felt during capture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sonic botany ("petals thrummed low C-sharps") and rhythmic control during disintegration ("zigzag through disintegrating paths"). Minor register drift in "transliterates emotions" during peak stress, but compression taught early pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero closure-dulling artifacts; "shards of shattered sound that hung like glass" exemplifies high-density imagery. Slight parallelism in "calm fear became... desperate hope, a rising minor third" risks template cadence but avoids scaffold loops. Propulsion flawless through fracture sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms "sound garden" trope through concrete physics (sound shards as navigable obstacles). "Feral lullaby" synthesis feels inevitable, though "sleepwalking constellations" risks familiarity. Emotional truth in exhaustion-weaving elevates beyond surface novelty.</comment>
