<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "poetic soul drowned in burnished sorrow" and micro-choice to ignore Varek, but "burnished sorrow" repetition edges toward label-only emotion in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly with "shattered the vase, and with it, the future" crystallizing cost; causal lens holds from "she acted" through storm resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Crystal shard constrains choice (placement in mirror) and charges final image (cold in palm), though "amber river" sensory overload slightly narrows perception unnaturally during crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally as storm peaks force Elara's demonstration; cost is unmistakable in "hollow cost of her revolution" but secondary dispute resolution slightly dilutes dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "science, not prayer" realization without moralizing; final image reweights revolution's cost through shard's coldness, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "amber river" and "temporal rapids" with rhythmic control, but "burnished sorrow" repetition creates minor voice convergence under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero loops in closure beat, but "burnished sorrow" paraphrase loop in high-pressure section triggers -0.2 artifact penalty despite strong propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archaeological dispute with temporal physics feels inevitable; "mirror ritual as science" twist transforms trope through specific character stakes.</comment>
