<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied through micro-choices: panic freeze vs planting, with the photograph’s physicality driving the earned endurance. No diagnostic labels during crisis; salt-softened edges show cost better than any epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "planting the sea holly anyway" crystallizes the erosion/optimism tension. Orientation anchors within 40 words; lens (Accumulative) holds as sensory density tightens pressure without causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The photograph’s worn edges and the trowel’s cold metal constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy narrows during panic (metallic taste) then expands with recovery (cedar cologne), avoiding static cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through somatic escalation (freeze → tunneling vision → stillness), but the external cliff erosion lacks concrete pressure on the present action. Cost is legible in the photograph’s physical decay yet feels slightly detached from the immediate beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through sea holly roots gripping stone and the lighthouse’s automation, rejecting binaries. Final image reweights "optimism" as action despite known fragility, avoiding moralizing while charging prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in stress-filtered details ("roar in ears subsided, replaced by wind sighing"). Rhythmic control modulates with panic (short phrases) to calm (longer cadences), teaching compression early without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Kaleidoscope of shattering glass" slightly overwrites the high-pressure beat, but density otherwise excels. Zero loops; verbs like "coaxing life" and "trembling hand" replace abstraction. Final line’s propulsion ("plant one more seed") avoids closure-beat artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma recovery via coastal botany avoids therapy tropes. Specificity of "salt-stung earth" and "dune grass fragility" transforms universal themes, while the somatic marker method feels earned rather than gimmicky.</comment>
