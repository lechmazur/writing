<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's embodied emotion ("boots crunched on shale") and specific flaw (spirit's shame) shine, but lacks contradictory impulses in her resolve; "modestly fearless" remains untested until climax without visible struggle, missing micro-choices under pressure during pivotal harp sequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: spirit's dissolving laughter reconfigures meaning with felt cost ("ache in heart lighter"); Accumulative lens holds through density of dissonant notes and spectral confessions without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Echo Gorge's "dissonant frequencies" directly constrain choice (harp method) and charge the final image; "luminous ache" evolves from oppressive to healing, meeting 9+ gate via micro-setting (fissure depth, water's edge) shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: harp's dissonance intensifies to vibrate confessions, narrowing options until laughter transforms; cost is undeniable in spirit's dissolution and Elara's lighter ache under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "laughter as body's grasp for life," avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "luminous ache" into healing without stated moral, with meaningful ambiguity in laughter's duality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bruised gold and lavender," compression under stress) with rhythmic control; minor register drift in "modestly fearless resolve" avoids head-hopping or POV leakage during high-pressure harp sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero closure artifacts; high density with propulsion except one paraphrase loop ("silence echoed louder than noise"/"only sound") causing minor momentum drag early, capped by vivid textural specificity ("shale path," "gasp becoming lighter").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "soul collector" trope via misaligned harp mechanics; "laughter during drowning" transforms grief cliché with emotional specificity, avoiding safety middle through bold laughter-as-life-affirmation risk.</comment>
