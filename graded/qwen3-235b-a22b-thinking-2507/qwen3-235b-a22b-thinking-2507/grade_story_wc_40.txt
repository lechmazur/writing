<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete actions (cradling crystal, weathered hands) but internal conflict between scholarly rigor and mystical belief remains underdeveloped during pivotal mutations; "weathered innocence" trait lacks contradictory impulses when hearing "verdant."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: crystal shatter physically manifests linguistic fragility while tears and dancing dust motes crystallize emotional weight; Accumulative lens holds through accelerating word fractures to the final "tonary" revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Library functions as active micro-setting: grimy windows distort light affecting crystal alignment, dust motes evolve from "forgotten tomes" to "scattered letters" charging the final hope; environment constrains every action from page-turning to sound capture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency—leaning closer triggers accelerated mutations ("dictionary" to "tonary")—with visible cost in the shattering crystal and emotional toll; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens as linguistic density increases toward web-like realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete particulars: "verdant" softening to "j" and "solitude" splitting embody language's organic growth; final image of dust motes as "fragile, weathered thing, but alive" reweights the library's decay without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("vestiges of night clinging like dust") modulates rhythm from lyrical to staccato during mutations; compression of word fragments taught early pays off in the accelerating sequences without losing legibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "rustling leaves" metaphor for "verdant" echoes integrates organically with pressure; only minor deduction for "weathered innocence" abstraction quickly redeemed by cradling the crystal's physicality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms linguistic evolution trope through the crystal's sonic properties: "tonary" birthed from fracture feels inevitable, not gimmicky; risk-taking heightens stakes by making language's growth physically tangible without sacrificing coherence.</comment>
