<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "she gathered the girl’s fragmented confessions" versus her own abandoned storytelling, but "regret coiled like cold wire" edges toward stock metaphor, slightly diluting embodied emotion in a pivotal beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly—"hollow certainty that some negotiations end in silence" crystallizes cost through the lagoon’s fractured stillness, though the "hundred fragments" rule risks arbitrary mechanics without deeper causal grounding in the ritual’s logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lagoon’s "glassy silt" and "waterlogged negatives" charge the final image, but setting remains atmospheric rather than tactical; it mirrors emotion without constraining Elara’s choices (e.g., no physical barrier altering her scavenging path).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen accumulatively as fragments accrue, narrowing options toward the ritual’s climax, but the "one hundred fragments" rule lacks causal weight—why not ninety-nine? This softens the pressure escalation despite potent emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the lagoon’s "fractured mirror" and "eroded ambitions," culminating in the ghost’s phrase reweighting "looking away" as both literal and existential cost—no moralizing, pure resonance in "tears cut tracks through silt."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("boots crunched on glassy silt," "sorrow like pollen") shines, but "chronologically confused" drifts into diagnostic label-speak during high-stakes reflection, slightly fracturing voice consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is crystalline except "regret coiled like cold wire"—a stock metaphor in peak emotional beat—triggering Overwriting Check penalty; otherwise, zero loops and surgical specificity ("brittle plastic," "water-blurred notes") propel momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms scavenger tropes through the lagoon’s kinetic stillness and camera-wheel fragments, but the "hundred rituals" convention risks template reliance; saved by the ghost’s dissolution as irreversible emotional forfeiture.</comment>
