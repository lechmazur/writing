<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction vividly embodied ("balancing sorrow... steely resolve; no sentimental indulgence") with micro-choices like paper reassembly under wind stress revealing hierarchy of values. Slight deduction for near-perfect emotional calibration lacking deeper doubt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds flawlessly: pressure intensifies through pattern recognition ("methodically drawing parallels") culminating in Charged Poise closure where "truth once buried grew thorns" crystallizes irreversible cost. Orientation clear by word 20 with ivy-choked platforms.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ivy and rosebush actively constrain choices—the petal drop times action, thorns mirror deferred honesty. Final image ("ivy brushing her coat like ghostly fingers") charges closure by transforming setting into embodied cost, satisfying Q3's 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elara's agency as she draws parallels, narrowing options to confrontation. Cost legible in "grief... valid but paralysis served no one," with moral calculus sharpening her peak choice to expose patterns rather than assign blame.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete objects: the letter's "vibrant artistry" reweights noble lies as "beauty cloaking truths." Final line ("would not let the rosebush’s lesson fade") delivers non-literal answer without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct historian's perceptual signature ("emotionally rational," "measured urgency") modulates under stress with compressed diction ("calmly reassembled"). Slight register drift in "recapture truth from that pit" offsets rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffold; "gust of wind scattered papers" avoids cliché via active resolution. Minor deduction for "symbolized time’s relentless march" (telling) but compensated by "thorns stood exposed like consequences" showing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "noble lie" trope through historian's emotional rationality and the illuminated letter's dual role as evidence/mirror. Freshness in making truth-telling a physical act ("trace the border") with irreplaceable stakes.</comment>
