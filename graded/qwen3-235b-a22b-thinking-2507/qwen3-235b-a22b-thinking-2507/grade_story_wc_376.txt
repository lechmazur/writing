<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "whispered fears" that physically reassemble the map; wilting trait embodies moral cost without therapy-speak. Ben's lie forces immediate micro-choice (gathering fragments while wilting), revealing hierarchy of values. Only minor abstraction in "motivation burned sharper than acidic haze" slightly dilutes embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: voices flow into her only through vulnerability, reconfiguring truth as connection not accuracy. Causal lens holds perfectly—candor directly enables map reconstruction. Ben's lie creates meaningful tightening; orientation (<120 words) establishes greenhouse stakes instantly. Cost proof: "She didn’t wilt. She bloomed" crystallizes the trade-off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Greenhouse micro-setting constrains every choice (toxic sky forces indoor search, condensation drips mark time). Banyan tree’s resinous heart charges the final image, while "sun-scorched celery" spine metaphor shows embodied specificity. Slight overreliance on visual/olfactory details; tactile humidity could deepen pressure during map reconstruction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering voices) tightens through Ben’s dishonesty, forcing candor as the only viable tactic. Agency is purely Elara’s—each whispered admission narrows options toward vulnerability. Cost is visceral (wilting) and conceptual (truth requires surrender). "Follow the silent wires" clue deepens stakes without coincidence; pressure coheres under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through map mechanics: "candor in small moments" reweights truth as connective tissue, not moral purity. Final image rejects sentimentality—voices flow only when she blooms through vulnerability, not triumph. No explicit moralizing; the zinc plate’s grid reprises as neural network, charging closure with social cost of lost communication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: calligrapher’s precision ("torn edges into alignment") shapes noticing. Rhythm shifts with pressure—staccato during wilting, fluid when blooming. Minor register drift in "motivation burned sharper than acidic haze" slightly jars POV lexicon. No dialogue beyond Ben’s two lines, but subtext-rich ("merely checking on her").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "rustled console" and "crystalline filaments" show textural specificity. Final line’s cadence ("She didn’t wilt. She bloomed") delivers propulsion. Opening’s "perpetual tremor above the toxic sky" slightly overwrites with abstraction, but payoff in banyan’s hum redeems density. No closure-dulling artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms treasure map trope through "candor" mechanic—truth physically reassembles fragments. Emotional specificity in "I miss my sister’s voice" avoids generic loss. Wilting trait synthesizes physical/moral stakes uniquely. Risk-taking (truth as map glue) heightens coherence; the banyan’s sound-absorbing resin feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
