<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction under pressure is present (vulnerability/strength) but lacks deeper irrationality beyond physical discomfort; micro-choices like dice roll reveal values, yet emotional progression stays too calibrated without messy hypocrisy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: water at knees with calm departure crystallizes vulnerability-as-strength cost; Accumulative lens holds through water rise and dance decryption, but no visible flaw-driven mistake compounds pressure before resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sunken lab constrains choices relentlessly—knee-deep water forces swim exit, algae-slick walls inform tactile decryption; obsidian dice and terminal glow charge final image, fulfilling 9+ gate by shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Water rise escalates pressure under Accumulative lens, forcing dance decryption; agency in physical cipher method narrows options, but cost during peak action (knee-deep water) emerges slightly late without prior tactical tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "encrypt vulnerability as strength" crystallizes in dance and final swim; no moralizing, yet "cradle of resilience" edges toward sentimentality without deeper thematic friction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lyrical code breaker" noticing rhythm in chaos) shines; rhythmic control under pressure flawless, though "cradle of resilience" momentarily drifts into elevated diction inconsistent with Elara’s pragmatic focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; "water seeped... air hung... place once humming" uses template cadence but avoids closure beat; high density with strategic figurative language, though "spider spins web" metaphor slightly overloads sensory hierarchy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vulnerability/strength via dance decryption transcends tropes; obsidian hangman’s dice and sunken lab feel irreplaceable, yet emotional specificity lacks one bold risk (e.g., flawed memory under stress) to reach 9.5+.</comment>
