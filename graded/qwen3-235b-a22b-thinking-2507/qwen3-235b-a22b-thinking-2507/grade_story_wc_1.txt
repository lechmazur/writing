<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority excels through embodied choices (kneeling to read frost patterns), but "purpose in the pauses" motivation borders on abstraction despite bruise/vial embodiment. Contradictory impulses (fear vs deliberate reconstruction) earn closure, though epiphany lacks sufficient friction with survival instinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully when she carries purpose within her adaptive spirit, with visible cost in the bruised wrist and melted frost. Orientation anchors at 27 words ("canyon's cool stone," "stars pricked the velvet sky"), and Accumulative lens holds through frost-pattern accumulation to vial discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Canyon functions as micro-setting that constrains choices—frost patterns enable tracking and charge the final image (melted patterns, vial discovery). North-facing rocks' ice traceries directly alter tactics, avoiding postcard description through purpose-driven specificity like "needle-like ice crystals near an overhang."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the ledger's cryptic notations evolving from "Canyon West" to payment coordinates, narrowing options to tracking. Protagonist agency drives escalation via frost-pattern interpretation, but time pressure ("dawn bled") lacks a live clock that actively alters moves beyond the melting evidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "purpose in the pauses" crystallizes not in grand revelation but micro-moments (frost highlighting a snapped twig). Final image of the ledger as "ember of clarity" reweights the premise without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through the vial's charged reprise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in artist's observations ("rhythms in the frost—swirls where boots disturbed dust"), but "drifting resonance" repetition risks tic-like uniformity. Voice modulates effectively from trembling panic to quiet resolve, though lexical density occasionally strains plausibility mid-crisis ("resonant reconfiguration").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density falters in the final third with scaffold loops: "purpose in the pauses" recurs verbatim, and "drifting resonance" repeats without pattern payoff. Still, propulsion remains strong through concrete verbs ("clutched," "knelt," "retrace") and minimal filter usage, avoiding closure-dulling artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glass artistry with smuggling tropes (lantern shards as signal markers) transforms genre conventions. Emotional specificity in "shoving the ledger into her pocket before diving for cover" avoids generic survival arcs, though "scorched testament" concept slightly leans on familiar metaphor without full reinvention.</comment>
