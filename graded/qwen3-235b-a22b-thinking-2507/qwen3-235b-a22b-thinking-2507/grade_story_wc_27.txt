<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("awkwardly confident") shown through embodied choices like trembling fingers and clumsy laugh, but "despair is the enemy" line risks diagnostic label-speak without sufficient embodied cost in the beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strongly with sensory density building to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "void where purpose once burned" and hum's tangible thrum altering survivors' state.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Permacrete floor and opera glasses constrain choices (kneeling to feel hum, aligning lenses) and charge the final image—"bare feet rooted to the earth" as fertile ground for renewal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist's agency as she shifts from seeking meaning to realizing despair is the true enemy; cost is the void of lost purpose made visceral through physical resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete actions: "fertile ground" reweights chaos without moralizing; final image answers central question through the hum's tangible thrum awakening survivors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bruised purples," "tectonic pulse") with rhythmic control, but minor filter-verb stacks ("she’d scavenged," "she couldn’t let it end") slightly dull immediacy in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with concrete propulsion, but paraphrase loop ("thunderous serenity" then "serenity wasn’t emptiness") and "hesitant golds" verge on decorative; no closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of space opera and earth mysticism through specific details (opera glasses for cosmic dust, stone circle as hope-frequency); risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
