<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in sister's erasure manifests in embodied choices (kneeling to read puddles, standing in water during drone threat), but internal contradiction lacks depth beyond duty vs fear; micro-choice to transmit despite capture risk earns closure with shivering cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "knee-deep in glowing water" as transmission completes while searchlights cut darkness; Accumulative lens holds through mineral resonance pressure narrowing options to one live-clock attempt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Auric lagoon constrains every critical choice (only starlight-enabled transmission site) and charges final image ("liquid starlight" on skin); mineral field isn't backdrop but functional constraint that reconfigures closure stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's agency under Accumulative lens: drone arrival tightens the starlight deadline, making physical cost ("soaked, shivering") inseparable from the dominant stake of historical truth surviving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action ("tyranny of indifference" embodied in sister's erasure), with final image ("lagoon's light would guide others") reweighting indifference as surmountable—no moralizing, only resonant cost in "carefully resourceful" persistence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in janitor-rebel duality ("faded insignia under grime," reading constellations in oily puddles); rhythmic compression under pressure ("He didn't run") taught early and paid off in transmission climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "warped starlight on oily water" and "auric glow painted his hands blue and gold" achieve textural specificity without muddle, propelling momentum through charged nouns/verbs in high-stakes beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dystopian tropes via functional auric lagoon mechanics; emotional truth in "quiet fury" over rage avoids middle-ground hedging, with risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
