<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s embodied motivation (transmuting pain via photos) drives key choices like giving her lavender photo to Leo, showing contradictory impulses in her calm facade. Secondary characters lack sufficient depth to fully serve as crucible, slightly weakening relationship dynamics under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "roots breaking stone" crystallizes healing’s slow cost with visible sacrifice (empty case, relinquished photo). Accumulative lens holds throughout, with density building to this resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lavender field functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (photo arrangement on earth) and charges closure—"roots breaking stone" reweights the environment’s role. Rust/lavender scent blend concretely mirrors emotional duality without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara’s agency: giving her photo to Leo narrows options (losing her own artifact) and alters tactics. Cost is legible but secondary pressure (community’s grief) lacks sufficient complication beyond passive witnessing, slightly softening escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically via photo arcs—no moralizing, with final image ("roots breaking stone") offering non-literal answer to healing’s cost. Mrs. Gupta’s weeping risks archetypal thinness, narrowly avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("dove gray case cradled like a fragile bird") persists under pressure. Rhythmic control elevates key beats ("silent stories into a winding path"), with no head-hopping despite multi-character arrival.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; final line ("gentle, earnest whimsy of roots breaking stone") achieves high density without muddle. Minor filter verb ("breath steadied") in high-pressure beat prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of photo-arc method avoids healing clichés, with "collective breath a visible cloud" as bold inflection. Derivative risk avoided through specific, lived detail in community interactions.</comment>
