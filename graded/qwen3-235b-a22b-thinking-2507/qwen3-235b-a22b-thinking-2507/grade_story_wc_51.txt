<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Diagnostic label-speak ("fractal weaver’s curse") in peak beat undermines embodied emotion; no contradictory impulses shown in scene, only ritual compliance without internal trade-offs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lens ambiguity at midpoint (situational vs. accumulative) triggers -0.4; closure (Charged Poise: trapped yet smiling) has undeniable cost ("weight sinking deep into her bones") but lens coherence slightly frayed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kerosene lamp constrains every critical choice (orienting flame to reveal burdens), charging the final image; minor momentum drag in atmospheric descriptions ("shingled hush" over-explained).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes feel passive—ritual mechanics drive escalation, not protagonist agency; no trade-offs or narrowing options, though cost ("sinking deep into her bones") is legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through calcified burdens (quartz laughter, basalt grief); final image reweights "boundary-lessly trapped" as endurance without moralizing, though "fractal weaver’s curse" borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("whalebone reverie," "shingled hush") modulates with pressure; mixed metaphor ("trembling as whalebone reverie"—rigid vs. trembling) violates physical logic in high-stakes beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Template cadence ("She knelt... She rotated... She lifted") and synonym churn ("pulsed faintly"/"resonating"/"humming") dull immediacy; minor figurative muddle in ritual sequences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis (calcified emotions as minerals) weakened by derivative "fractal weaver" trope; premise matches emotional-artifact templates without sufficient transformation of moral calculus.</comment>
