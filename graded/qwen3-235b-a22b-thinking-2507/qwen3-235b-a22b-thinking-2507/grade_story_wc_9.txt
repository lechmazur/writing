<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "willingly perplexed" surrender versus cartomancer's logic-driven past; embodied cost in "tears from her eyes" as star-petals settle. Slight over-articulation in "embracing confusion as the only compass" edges toward diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost: "tears from her eyes" and "weight of found time" crystallize her stance. Accumulative lens holds—density peaks with "visions erupted" as pressure reweights stakes through sensory cadence shifts without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The saucer’s crack functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (alignment, ink flow) and charging closure via porcelain "knitting together." Luminous moss and cloud-sea aren’t backdrop but active pressure—sorrow "condenses into dew" enabling the ritual’s rules.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten texturally: "choking beauty" evolves from oppressive ("pressed against eardrums") to breathable as visions flood back. Agency is fully Elara’s—pouring ink upward narrows options with visible cost (tears, physical warmth) under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: mending the saucer transforms "crack" from flaw to "channel," avoiding moralizing. Final image ("beauty no longer choked—it breathed with her") reweights absence/presence without stating a moral, earning conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature rooted in cartomancy: ink "swirling like trapped nebulae," time as "crystallizing" moments. Rhythm modulates perfectly—lyrical for visions, staccato for climax ("The saucer’s crack began to mend"). Zero voice contamination under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "petals of starlight drifted downward, each holding a frozen second of laughter" exemplifies triple-duty prose. Figurative language ("liquid shadow") remains coherent within established cartomancer lexicon, never muddling closure’s physicality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms maternal regret via cartomancy framework: "time leaked" through porcelain cracks feels fresh, not derivative. Emotional specificity in "bartered for coin" avoids sentimentality. Bold risk in Accumulative structure pays off with resonant closure.</comment>
