<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via psoriasis ledger (427 entries) versus Elias's grief math, but "quantified sorrow" edges toward diagnostic label-speak without sufficient embodied degradation under stress during peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost—"skin began to mend, one sorrow at a time"—under Accumulative lens; moonlight's physical/emotional trade-off crystallizes stance with no causality breaks in the single-scene pressure build.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sextant constrains every choice (waiting for moonlight, arranging pieces) and charges the final image when aimed at the oak; storm/clouds actively pressure timing, avoiding postcard description through tactile, goal-directed use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen organically as Aris shifts from "what trees saw" to "what they held," with the cost of redefined purpose made visible in his skin's mending; agency drives the dream-deconstruction turn under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (psoriasis tally, dream fragments on grid paper), culminating in the resonant final image—"one sorrow at a time"—that reweights grief without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("brass limbs splayed like a dead insect") and rhythmic control shine, though "deconstruct reality" slightly drifts from maintenance-worker lexicon during high-pressure realization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary from staccato ("He froze.") to lyrical ("Moonlight, fractured by storm clouds, bled through..."), with "psoriasis tingling" showing rather than telling in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astronomical tools and grief quantification transforms tropes; the sextant's moonlight-healing mechanic feels inevitable, with emotional specificity avoiding generic templates through Aris's psoriasis ledger.</comment>
