<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (guilt vs duty) drives the untethering choice with embodied cost; "apology choked back" and drawer pull micro-choice show authentic flaw-compounded struggle without over-tidiness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("he had not earned forgiveness") under Situational lens; moon-phase pressure forces crystallization with no causality breaks, orientation clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting (drawer pull) charges final image as repurposed tool; storm parapet constrains tactics via mist obscuring enemies, but physical terrain could deepen choice pressure slightly more.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Agency-driven escalation (envoy’s arrival tightening to "now or never") forecloses waiting with visible cost; moon-phase clock makes stakes viscerally felt under Situational lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image reweights drawer pull from "shard of loss" to "tool reshaped," offering non-literal answer to guilt’s redemption without moralizing; theme emerges purely through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("slick stone," "cool brass") and rhythmic compression under stress ("No words were spoken; none were needed") show distinct POV control; lyrical density taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "mist swirled, thick as grief" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose with precise rhythm; no figurative muddle even in high-pressure beats like the untethering climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Risk-taking in quiet closure transforms prisoner-exchange trope through specific emotional calculus; drawer pull’s irreplaceable evolution avoids abstraction while heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
