<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (silence guilt vs. need proof) drive micro-choices like scraping amber for ink. Final renunciation of blame earned through letters and tether ritual, with cost legible in "guilt... hushed, woven into quiet strength." Slight abstraction in "dissonance humming" barely tempers embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: time unfolds but guilt persists as "quiet strength." Under Accumulative lens, density intensifies via sensory pressure (stuttering clocks, translated cry), narrowing options to the tether ritual. Letter discovery slightly convenient but justified by prior knowledge of hidden compartment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Amber functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (scraped for ink) and charges final image (relic, not vessel of pain). Sensory detail selective and urgent—"resinous surface," "thin wail"—mirroring crisis perception. "Meteor hush" evolves from eerie to clean silence, avoiding overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Aris' agency: firmware's cry translation forces the tether choice, narrowing options to binding fractured moments. Cost unmistakable in "torrent of infant terror" endured to achieve hushed guilt. Slight convenience in letter discovery offset by micro-choice (pulling drawer) altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: amber's transformation from pain-vessel to relic offers non-literal answer to guilt. Final image ("sound became mercy") avoids moralizing by rooting insight in ritual action. No thematic echo; complexity retained in "guilt didn't vanish, but was hushed."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines—"needle's buzz swallowed," dissonance as "scalpel"—with syntax tightening under stress ("They couldn’t endure it"). "Meteor hush" motif modulates tone effectively. Minor cliché ("sharp as a scalpel") slightly dulls rhythmic control at peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with clear propulsion: "time had folded... suspended breath" compresses stakes. Zero loops in peak beats, but "dissonance humming beneath the silence" creates minor scaffold. No figurative muddle; final image ("deeper, cleaner silence") crystallizes closure without opacity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Firmware translating baby cries transforms "haunted machine" trope into emotional truth-teller. Risk-taking (time-fold as guilt metaphor) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh synthesis: amber as fossilized sound vessel reweights grief through scientific lyricism, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
