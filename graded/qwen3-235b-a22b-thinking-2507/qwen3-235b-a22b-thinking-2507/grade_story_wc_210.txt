<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (rejecting bottle's warmth while holding it) drive the refusal of false comfort; final conception choice earned through embodied clarity ("unyielding form a reminder") with visible cost in mental labor strain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: lanterns relighting "not from candle but rekindled will" crystallizes the reality-vs-illusion stake with conceptual cost ("sealed silence now symbol of future’s potential"), under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The amber bottle constrains every choice—from refusing illusion to symbolizing potential—and charges the final image; micro-setting (pier’s salt-bleach) directly shapes the bottle’s "fossilized tears" texture and thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through working memory’s visceral strain ("single lapse would unravel it"), with protagonist agency narrowing options via mental labor; cost is legible in breath-as-anchor during social-structure construction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through bottle/lantern evolution: "false comfort poison" becomes "seeds of what would grow," avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "sealed silence" as "unbroken, waiting" without stating the lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("buildings leaning like weary bones," "lanterns as captured stars"); rhythmic control modulates under pressure (staccato during memory strain, flowing in conception), with patterned elision taught early and paid at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line charges momentum ("amber glinted, but he did not look" compresses interiority); "fossilized tears" metaphor sustains physical logic while deepening theme without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms revival trope through working memory mechanics and salt-tolerant seagrass paths; emotional specificity ("sorrow acknowledged but not escaped") avoids generic hope, with risk-taking heightening coherence.</comment>
