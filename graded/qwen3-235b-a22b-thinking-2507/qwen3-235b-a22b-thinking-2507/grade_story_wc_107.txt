<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation for "safe zones" slightly abstract; villagers mentioned but not dramatized. Final abandonment choice earns closure through physical crisis, though thematic resonance could tighten. Contradictory impulses (grief/joy) embodied via theatrical narration of mundane tasks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is Decisive Change: flood forces abandonment with visible cost (tools/furnace left behind). Causal lens holds tightly—meltwater progression narrows options. Villagers stake slightly off-page but doesn't break closure cost legibility at "ankle-deep water swallowing footprints".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choices: meltwater forces retreat, frost-rimed console informs bookmark use. Final image of orbs on rocky outcrop charges closure with environmental specificity. Micro-setting (bookmark as heat shield) shapes tactics under stress.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (crafting safe zones vs. environmental/personal thaw) signaled early. Escalation driven by Elias' agency—water rise forces abandonment choice. Villagers' conflict remains abstract, limiting visceral stake escalation despite physical cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "stone yields to drip" verse reweights at closure without moralizing. Final image ("tiny suns in awakening land") offers resonant answer to "thawing heart" concept. Zero thematic echo; complexity in "weighty lightness" avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: theatrical narration ("Observe! The artisan...") reveals coping mechanism. Rhythmic control shifts during flood panic ("Heart pounding... waded through ankle-deep water"). "Thoughtfully spirited" trait borders on label but modulates effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Minor synonym loops ("melting ice" x4, "thawed" x3) in mid-scene. Elevated diction ("skeletal silence") slightly clashes with glassblower POV but doesn't obscure closure. Final line propulsion ("glowed behind him, tiny suns...") achieves high density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: bookmark as heat shield/talisman transforms trope. Emotional specificity in "weighty lightness" avoids templates. Derivative guardrail clear—no template plots; risk-taking (theatrical narration as healing) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
