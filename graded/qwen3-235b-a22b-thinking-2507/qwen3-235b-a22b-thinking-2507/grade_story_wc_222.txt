<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine: "heart pounding not with fear but exhilaration" embodies sacred play under pressure. Final choice to swap despite ice shard earns growth through visible cost—amending fear—not tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: sky mends as Silas "amended his own fear," with ice-shard near-disaster providing felt cost. Causal lens holds tight—sundial’s backward shadow to stillness charts irreversible change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting constrains every choice: "thousand-year glacier" fragility forces cautious abandon, while diamond-dust snow’s crunch anchors sensory urgency. Sundial’s frost-bitten brass charges the final image with reweighted meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fix celestial fracture) tightens via sundial’s creeping shadow, narrowing options to one decisive swap sequence. Cost is visceral—ice shard shearing forces movement *through* fear, not around it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action, not sermon: "sacred play" crystallizes as Silas leaves an ice acorn token mid-crisis. Final image ("walking home through the mended sky") reweights "dancing with chaos" without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives: "stars bleed downward" and "slick with ice" filter physics through Silas’s wonder. Rhythmic control peaks during swap—"fingers brushing the cold board"—compressing stress without voice slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; every line propels. "Violet softened toward dawn" does triple duty: setting shift, emotional release, and causal proof. No figurative muddle—even "sickly, inverted hue" serves physics-based stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "thief" trope through specific, grounded stakes: amending celestial fractures via chess-piece swaps feels inevitable. Emotional truth in "chivalrous thief" paradox avoids gimmickry while heightening coherence.</comment>
