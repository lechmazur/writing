<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "I am not my father" micro-choices, but embodied emotion lacks specificity; "suffocating echo" leans abstract when concrete sensory details would heighten the inherited lie's physical weight during the hover sequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with "chasing the only silence that mattered: his own," making the cost undeniable—but Accumulative lens clarity wavers mid-story when the lighthouse magic emerges without sufficient pattern-teaching for seamless causal integration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The reef's "jagged teeth" constrains escape tactics by forcing the ledge landing, and the lattice charges the final image as talisman—but "copperlight repose" occasionally drifts into atmospheric abstraction without consistently shaping immediate choices during corridor navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the live clock of "before they find the bodies," but escalation relies too heavily on setting's magic rather than protagonist agency; hovering redefines options yet feels externally granted, muting the earned cost of vanishing into exile.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the lattice's evolution from childhood hiding spot to escape talisman, with the final silence reweighting "inherited lies" without moralizing—but "sustains impossibilities" risks thematic abstraction where concrete stakes would deepen the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels in "copperlight repose" and reef-as-"molten ore," yet "sustained the weight of lies" drifts into elevated diction during peak tension, momentarily breaking the boy's plausible lexicon when visceral immediacy is paramount.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves lyrical propulsion with "threaded the labyrinth of the prison's lower corridors," but "sustains impossibilities" forms a minor conceptual loop in the hover sequence, slightly diluting pressure where concrete action should dominate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "cry wolf" myth through generational trauma and lighthouse magic feels inevitable, yet the hovering escape borders on convenient resolution—it transforms the trope but risks undermining stakes by granting agency through external wonder rather than earned struggle.</comment>
