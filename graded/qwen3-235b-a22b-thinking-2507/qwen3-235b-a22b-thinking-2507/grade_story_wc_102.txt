<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses during climax; past-life regret drives action but no competing present-tense conflict emerges when releasing the love. Micro-choices like breath control reveal values, but the 9+ gate fails due to unidirectional emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "dissolving the stagnant pool within her" crystallizes the emotional price. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—the tear’s transformation from relic to compass reconfigures meaning without causal gaps. Orientation test passed at 47 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The camera obscura and tear function as micro-setting, constraining choices (breath-synchronized observation) and charging the final image. Moonflower vines and viaduct bones actively store love, avoiding postcard description. Fails 9+ gate only by hairline margin—environment shapes tactics but lacks explicit constraint during the climax beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by protagonist agency: breath control transforms perception, then the tear’s activation. Dominant stake (locating unused love) tightens when observation shifts to participation, with visceral cost ("dissolving the stagnant pool"). Accumulative lens flawlessly executed—density peaks as gold threads emerge, narrowing options to a single act of release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "unused love released through connection" crystallizes when the tear refracts light into the keystone. Final image ("compass for her next journey") reweights the tear without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality by grounding insight in physical sensation ("warm and impossibly light" mist).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "pilgrim of sparks" lexicon and chemical-stained hands filter all observation. Rhythmic control mirrors breath cycles ("counting to four... exhaling for eight"), deepening under pressure. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance contracts during the tear’s activation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "petals drifted like pale moths" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor register drift in "spiritually curious ache" (abstract amid concrete action) prevents 9.5+. Final beat’s propulsion ("golden mist rising... seep into her skin") avoids figurative muddle while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "quest for love" trope via camera obscura mechanics and breath as activation method. Emotional specificity ("stagnant water" of withheld compassion) avoids generic templates. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes—the tear’s irreplaceable properties (refracting light, storing past failure) are causally essential.</comment>
