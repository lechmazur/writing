<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's pacifism manifests as active integration of darkness ("welcomed them, letting cold currents flow"), not passivity; survivor guilt and swallowed rage create contradictory impulses that crystallize in her "liberation, not destruction" climax with visible cost (impending death).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: "photographs now utterly dry" and "her time was near" crystallize the cost, while the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through patterned intensification of sensory residue (tears→shimmer→stitching) without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Recycled bulkheads aren't backdrop but active constraint—the shrine room's salvaged photos and Kwan Yin's tear directly enable the ritual, with the dried photographs' final state charging the closure image as purpose-fulfilled relics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by Elara's agency under Accumulative lens: her choice to "embrace the deepest shadow" with love narrows options from haunted vessel to liberation, with cost made undeniable through the drying photographs and her imminent death.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through concrete struggle—no moralizing—culminating in the resonant final image "mended the unbroken" which reweights grief as wholeness, avoiding sentimentality while carrying conceptual cost of her mortality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in grief-filtered details ("shadows clinging like dust," tears as "dying stars"); rhythmic control shifts from meditative cadence during shadow work to urgent compression during stitching without voice slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; every sentence multi-tasks (e.g., "her body floated higher... amplifying the stitch's power" advances plot/theme/character); no figurative muddle even in peak beats like the luminous thread pull.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Pacifism redefined as active shadow integration feels inevitable yet fresh; "gravitationally lighter" trait literalizes emotional weight with specificity (satellite wire needle, tear's blue pulse) avoiding generic apocalypse tropes.</comment>
