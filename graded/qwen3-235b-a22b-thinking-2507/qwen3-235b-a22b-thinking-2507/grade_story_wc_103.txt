<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (scientist's curiosity vs. paternal grief) act simultaneously in the climax; final renunciation of photos earns closure with visceral cost ("hollow where memories used to be"). No therapy-speak—emotions embodied through tactile details like "trembling fingers" and "heart hammered".</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: the blank photograph with clock watermark reweights time's nature with undeniable conceptual cost ("grief lived in the hollow"). Causal lens holds—fragment grasp directly triggers disintegration and temporal unraveling. Orientation anchors by word 50.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Living bridge garden constrains every choice (shifting hedges force navigation) and charges the final image ("watermark shaped like a clock"). Micro-setting (halo fragment's hollow) directly enables the climax. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—crushed mint/ozone during crawl, narrowed perception during collapse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escaping temporal prison vs. preserving memories) tightens when the fragment becomes accessible, forcing irreversible agency. Cost is visceral: daughter's photo dissolving into "silver mist" as direct consequence of Aris's choice. Pressure coheres under causal lens—no coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through concrete particulars: "texture of time was grief" crystallizes from tactile decay of photos and honey/sand metaphors. Final image reweights the clock watermark without moralizing—earned through sensory erosion, not abstract statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: architectural terms ("hyperbolic geometry," "origami shapes") filtered through designer's mind. Rhythm modulates perfectly—long contemplative sentences fracture into staccato beats during collapse ("Vines recoiled with audible snaps"). Zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("ivory veins retracting like startled nerves" does triple duty). Figurative language serves pressure without muddle—"gritty as sand yet viscous as cooled honey" crystallizes time's texture in climax. Final line’s rhythm charges closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "scientist's regret" trope through hyperbolic geometry mechanics. Emotional specificity in "grief as hollow where memories used to be" avoids cliché. Risk-taking (non-Euclidean physics as emotional metaphor) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
