<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "repair wasn't conquest, but communion"; embodied emotion through numb fingers tracing gears. Final choice earned by prophecy integration, with nostalgia softening into pride as visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: synchronized reflections crystallize options with emotional cost ("driftwood nostalgia softened"). Accumulative lens holds via prophecy density shifts; eclipse deepening reweights stakes. Orientation clear by word 40; cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ice constrains every choice—crunching steps, disorienting reflections forcing prophecy search. Final "frost melting in slow tears" charges closure. Micro-setting (chisel, gear) directly enables action; sensory hierarchy reflects urgency under eclipse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes viscerally felt through "world below would stall," escalated by accumulating prophecy density and eclipse deepening. Agency pure in listening action; cost undeniable as nostalgia transforms into "quiet pride." One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "rhythm is not in the hammer's fall" reframing repair as communion. Final image ("learned its song") reweights premise without moralizing; nostalgia woven into pride shows earned complexity. Avoids thematic echo or false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: notices ice ferns, gear teeth, breath fog. Rhythm varies from lyrical ("cathedral of ice-locked tomes") to compressed ("Not with a wrench..."). Elision taught early; no head-hopping despite mirrored selves.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("temporal splinters, sharp and disorienting"). Minor scaffold in "driftwood nostalgia clung... she remembered" slightly dulls immediacy. Peak beats avoid figurative muddle; final line recharges motif with "distant morning finally, truly, began."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms tropes: "lunar-eclipse locksmith" defines repair philosophy. Synthesis inevitable—driftwood (organic time) vs. clockwork resolving in "rhythm understood." Bold risk: time repair through listening, not fixing; elevates stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
