<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority leans poetic over embodied contradiction; "tears pricked" lacks visceral struggle despite high-stakes memory trigger. Motivation clear but final choice lacks visible tradeoffs beyond emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with conceptual cost in "first note of the next generation’s song," but music box discovery relies on coincidence that edges toward resolution rather than complication under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dunes and jars function as micro-setting constraining choices—digging for driftwood yields music box, jars evolve from archives to "vessels for communion," charging the final image with environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation (music box → girl’s hum), but coincidence-driven girl’s arrival slightly undermines protagonist agency in escalation; pressure tightens meaningfully through reweighted sound capture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from jars to hum without moralizing; final image reweights "translator" concept through concrete action, avoiding abstraction while embracing intergenerational fragility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("breath frosting the thin air of his lonesome splendor") with rhythmic control; cadence shifts mirror emotional beats without elision issues, sustaining Accumulative lens coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in "sweetened the very air" borders on purple prose but avoids closure impact; zero loops or scaffold, with high density in pivotal beats like the music box’s "fragile, off-key melody."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "found object" trope through sensory mechanics; jars premise feels fresh via specific emotional calculus, with risk-taking in quiet closure that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
