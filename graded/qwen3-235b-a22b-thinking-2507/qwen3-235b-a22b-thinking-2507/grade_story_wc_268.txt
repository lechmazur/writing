<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris’s quiet dignity and Elara’s humble resolve feel earned through embodied choices (smudged ink, trembling hand), though Varek lacks interior contradiction. "Regally unpretentious" manifests in Aris’s final bow, not labels, but usurper’s motivation stays surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a flawless Decisive Change: Varek’s decree dissolves with visible cost (crown clattering, empire "reduced to dust motes"). Causal lens holds perfectly—celestial alignment enables rune manifestation, triggering Aris’s "Witness" and the collapse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Iron gall ink constrains choices (Aris prepares it early) and charges closure ("smudged but indelible" as promise kept). Dust motes and moonlight evolve with events, avoiding static description. Micro-setting elevates to 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes ("unmask the pretender") tighten meaningfully: Varek’s demand → rune manifestation → his lunge → Aris’s "Witness." Cost is visceral (Varek’s "quiet finality"), driven by Aris’s agency under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "graceful collapse of illusion," indelible ink as truth’s persistence. Final image reweights "rune of drift" without moralizing—Elara lifting the crown amid dust motes answers the central question resonantly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV’s stone-textured rhythm ("sigh like stone settling") deepens under pressure. Perceptual signature shines (dust motes, ink’s "oak galls" smell), but Varek’s dialogue lacks distinct idiom, slightly flattening voice contrast.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion via precise verbs ("dissolving," "shattered," "surged"). Figurative language sparse but potent ("empire of lies reduced to dust motes"). Final line recharges ink motif without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tropes transformed through specific logic: "rune of drift" as shifting constellations, ink’s preparation ritual. "Graceful collapse" avoids violence, feeling inevitable. Risk in quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
