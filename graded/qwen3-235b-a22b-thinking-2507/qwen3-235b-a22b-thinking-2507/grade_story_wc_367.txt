<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses (duty vs doubt) manifest in micro-choices like trembling adjustments and the wick plunge, with embodied panic ("clawed at her throat") avoiding diagnostic labels. Herald’s pressure remains external, limiting relationship depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: "broken light" transforms from failure to amplification with felt cost (panic nearly causing perpetual gloom). Hybrid lens (Accumulative tension/Causal resolution) holds, though rogue wave borders on coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass wick’s physics constrains every choice—misalignment causes crisis, realignment enables dawn. Final image of "shadows trailing like loyal ghosts" charges closure, with salt-crusted stone and rain-slicked dome altering tactics during the wave jolt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shaping dawn) tightens via wave-induced misalignment, narrowing options to Elara’s realignment choice. Her agency in steering "broken" light creates irreversible cost (doubt nearly dooming the world), escalating pressure under Hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "using brokenness to mend" crystallizes when scattered beams converge. Final image of "fragile, luminous hope" resonates without moralizing, reweighting earlier shadows as tools rather than threats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "boots scuffing salt-crusted stone," "laughter pealing across waves." Under stress, syntax compresses ("Panic clawed"), while "thrum of ancient shadows" modulates rhythm to mirror her elation-to-terror shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "glass wick" recurrence evolves meaningfully. Peak-beat density soars: "light splintered, scattering in fractured shards" conveys chaos without muddle. "Stolen shadow" phrase recharges motif with visceral propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse trope via physics-as-magic ("total internal reflection" enabling dawn-shaping). "Shadowed elation" synthesizes emotional specificity with fresh stakes, avoiding genre clichés through tangible cost (perpetual gloom threat).</comment>
