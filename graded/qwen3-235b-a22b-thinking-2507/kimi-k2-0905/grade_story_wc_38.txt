<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority shines via embodied contradiction ("calm defiance stitched into every pause") and micro-choices (dice roll as compass), but "vulnerability is the hinge" risks thematic echo despite physical integration; swallowing the page earns closure with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost ("lab shuddered, surrendering its remaining air"); accumulative lens holds through density escalation (dice/spider/web) with clear orientation by paragraph one.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting (dice on silt, body as cipher) constrains choices and charges the final image; environment actively pressures tactics ("flooded console," spider's web as live clock) with sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (decode before web completes) tightens through Mara's agency (dice roll, arabesque), narrowing options with visible cost ("lab shuddered"); accumulative escalation reweights vulnerability as strength.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through embodied particulars (swallowed dance diagram), not moralizing; final image of child dancing offers resonant answer to central question without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ankles wrote cursive warnings") with rhythmic control under pressure; compression taught early ("water itself were her metronome") pays off in closure's lyrical propulsion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with clear propulsion ("She rolled; the dice obliged"); no figurative muddle despite poetic intensity, though "pirouette of numbers" slightly risks overwriting in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dance cryptography transforms tropes; risk-taking (lyric structure, swallowing data) heightens stakes coherently, with emotional specificity avoiding abstraction ("tasted like salt and singing").</comment>
