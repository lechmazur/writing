<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority leans on lyrical abstraction over contradictory impulses; "vulnerability is the hinge" risks diagnostic tell but is partially redeemed by embodied action (swallowing the page). Micro-choices like dice roll lack visible internal friction despite strong embodied emotion in calf muscles spelling warnings.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost (lab's destruction, swallowed page), but dice roll resolving the airlock choice violates "coincidence may complicate but not resolve" under Accumulative lens. Orientation clear by word 10, yet causality slip in pivotal moment prevents 8.8+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting (dice, water currents) constrains choices and charges final image—dice determine airlock path, currents waltz Mara to archive. Sunken lab details ("silt-covered floor," "bioluminescent ink") are tactile and pressure-driven, avoiding white-room syndrome while reflecting dancer's embodied perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finish before web completes) tightens credibly, but protagonist agency falters when dice "obliged" the resolution—a coincidence that solves rather than complicates. Cost (lab's surrender) is externalized; Mara's internal trade-off (vulnerability as strength) lacks sufficient on-page friction during the vortex sequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: "vulnerability is the hinge" crystallizes through swallowed dance diagram and child's spontaneous movement, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights vulnerability as strength without abstraction, though "calm defiance" phrase edges toward thematic echo before being redeemed by bodily action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (dancer's body as decryption tool) and rhythmic control shine ("ankles wrote cursive warnings"), but "vulnerability is not the lock" momentarily drifts into therapeutic register amid physical urgency. No head-hopping; compression taught early via spider/web timeline pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion through concrete verbs ("surrendered its remaining air in a silver sigh"). Figurative language ("dice clinked softly like two tiny bones") remains coherent under pressure. Minor register drift in "calm defiance" phrase avoids penalty due to contextual embodiment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dance cryptography and vulnerability-as-strength transcends tropes; sunken lab setting avoids post-apocalyptic clichés through tactile specificity. Risk-taking (lyric structure, swallowing data) heightens stakes coherently, with child's final movement feeling inevitable yet revelatory.</comment>
