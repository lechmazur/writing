<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (claustrophobia vs. duty) drives micro-choices; embodied fear ("knees scraped volcanic glass") and naming ritual reveal values under pressure without diagnostic labels. Final renunciation of sorrow for obligation carries visible cost in the tide-ebbing moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tide-peak emergence crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost (memory as obligation), under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors within 80 words; no causality breaks as gold fleck's progression tightens pressure toward the codex settlement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (gold fleck) constrains choices and charges closure: tracing it initiates phase shifts, coating tracks enables release, and its final settlement reweights the memorial premise. Sensory hierarchy (brine, volcanic glass) filters through Mara's claustrophobia to heighten urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Mara's agency: naming technicians narrows options (thinning gold fleck) while shifting from physical survival to memory-bearing. The tidal clock tightens tactics ("between one tide and the next"), making the conceptual cost of remembrance undeniable as claustrophobia "ebbs with the tide".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "names repeating in her chest like heartbeat" reweights remembrance as active resistance, not sorrow. Final image ("copper strand in the long cable between past and tomorrow") offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "fractal burns across reality" reflects Mara's scientific lens under duress. Rhythmic control intensifies during phase shifts ("concrete giving way to living basalt"), with zero head-hopping; compression taught early pays off in the tidal transition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "liquid thread that seeped into the air" demonstrates high-density propulsion. Figurative language ("pulsed with the crash of surf she could not see") clarifies physical logic under pressure, with final line ("ordinary roar of water against rock") recharging prior motifs flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms sci-fi tropes through emotional specificity: undersea cables become vessels for collective memory, not mere tech. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "crashing hush" evolving into ordinary roar feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
