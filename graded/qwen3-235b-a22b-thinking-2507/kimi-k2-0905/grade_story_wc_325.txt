<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied claustrophobia ("knees scraped volcanic glass") and contradictory impulses (fear vs. gold fleck's pull), though micro-choices lack explicit value hierarchy during technician encounters. Final endurance as Earned Stasis earns cost via "wider fear—and obligation."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: Mara’s "obligation of remembering" crystallizes when names become "copper strands" between past/future. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—density peaks as gold fleck thins, reweighting stakes via auroral scars and Dr. Voss’s sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Basalt throat and volcanic glass constrain choices (crawling descent), while the codex’s gold fleck charges the final image by settling into Voss’s hand. Sensory hierarchy masterfully narrows under pressure: brine thickens as claustrophobia screams, yet gold’s "luminous lacquer" dominates perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mara’s agency: uttering names thins the gold fleck, forcing a trade-off between speed and witness. Cost is unmistakable—"wider fear" replaces claustrophobia as she accepts the "obligation," with tidal timing ("moment between inflow/outflow") crystallizing irreversible stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: names as "copper strands" reconfigure remembrance as active return, not sorrow. Final image ("ordinary roar of water") resonates without moralizing, while "crashing hush" transforms from spectral prison to silenced signal—complex ambiguity lingers in "breathing world" redemption.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: Mara’s claustrophobia filters details ("concrete giving way to living basalt"), and rhythmic control escalates via fragmented clauses during descent. Gold fleck’s "phase transition" metaphor remains lexically consistent under stress, avoiding therapy-speak while deepening tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in "fractal burns across reality" slightly dilutes propulsion, but sentence variety ("She traced it... feeling the phase transition begin") sustains momentum. Zero scaffold loops; "crashing hush" repetition evolves meaning without redundancy, though "hush inside his skull" borders on stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms undersea cables into memory conduits with fresh specificity: technicians become "crashing hush" beggars, signals phase-shift flesh to rumor. Emotional truth anchors novelty—Mara’s claustrophobia isn’t a trope but a visceral counterpoint to oceanic vastness, with risk-taking (lyric physics) heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
