<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Corin’s transformation from meekness to defiance feels earned through embodied micro-choices (folding silk mouse, cutting cable, striking gong), not epiphanies. His blacksmith specificity—knowing "weight and how to unmake it"—constrains tactics credibly under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: arches singing instead of threatening, citizens feeling resilience unfurl, with felt cost in magicians’ power loss. Lens holds as Accumulative/Textural—density shift when silk dissolves into starlight seals pact with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orchard planet’s upside-down roots and floating arches aren’t backdrop but active constraints—Corin’s gravity-oxen expertise enables tunnel access. The slag pile (once swords) charging his landing and the silk’s evolving role as compass/hammer make setting indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when lift jams "between starlight above and furnace glow below," forcing Corin’s cable-cutting agency. Cost is visceral: magicians lose sky-high hold, citizens’ fear transforms to resilience. Single escalation suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "resilience must be coaxed from rubble" isn’t stated but enacted via silk’s transformations and Corin teaching others at the well. Final image of arches singing reweights prior threat without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in tactile details ("calloused fingers folded the fabric," "slag sighed beneath him"). Rhythmic control under pressure: short clauses during cable-cutting ("breathed once, twice") contrast lyrical opening. Zero head-hopping despite magicians’ arrival.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "bruised-azure shadow" and "slag that once was swords" exemplify high-density imagery. Only borderline overwriting: "whispered of awakenings yet unpaid" risks abstraction but is redeemed by immediate action (folding silk into mouse).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "meek blacksmith" trope: his quiet expertise with weight/gravity solves the arch problem, not brute force. Risk-taking (lyric prose, conceptual stakes) heightens coherence—floating arches feel inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
