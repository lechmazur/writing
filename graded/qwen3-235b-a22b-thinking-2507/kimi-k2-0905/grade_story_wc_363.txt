<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete ("lungs working like bellows with no sound") but motivation lacks contradictory impulses; final choice feels mythic rather than earned by prior causality. No visible irrationality or blind spots in the crisis moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation fails at 120 words (no era/cultural anchors beyond "loom"), triggering -0.4 penalty. Closure lands powerfully as Earned Stasis with visceral cost (swallowed bead, unspooled name), but lens ambiguity early weakens escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orchard functions as active constraint: cider-rot affects thread handling, bamboo fiber sources loom material. Micro-setting charges final image with rewound aging trees proving environment shapes tactics decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("impossible distance"); escalation lacks protagonist agency under Accumulative lens. Cost (voice loss) is felt but pressure doesn't tighten—revelation outweighs struggle in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through subtext: "raveling silence" evolves from description to literalized cost. Final image (golden sap beads holding threads) resonates without moralizing, answering communication's cost through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("fingers remembered the orchard before her mind did"), rhythm mirrors loom's cadence. Near-flaw: "cider and copper and goodbye" slightly overwrites the climax's physicality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Impeccable propulsion with zero scaffold; "shuttle clacked like a second heart" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Minor deduction: "stoically sparkling" appears verbatim twice without evolving meaning in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms weaving tropes through specific physics (thread "drinking voice until yarn glowed gold"). Derivative risk in premise offset by heirloom apple petal's scarred runic seam charging closure.</comment>
