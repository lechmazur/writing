<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in tactile details (yarn's "vibration she could almost read") but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses during climax; final renunciation earned though micro-choices under pressure feel sparse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable cost: muteness crystallizes as "frost over still water" while the petal's runic seam confirms message delivery, reconfiguring silence as both loss and conduit under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orchard setting charges final image—bamboo "like pale yarn" at dawn and sap beads holding thread transform environment into active constraint; cider-rot scent and loom mechanics evolve causally with each puzzle piece fitted.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist's agency: swallowing the bead (not coincidence) narrows options to irreversible muteness; cost crystallizes as "words pooled on her tongue like cooling iron," charging the final image with conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "impossible distance measured in forgotten lullabies" reframes sacrifice as linguistic alchemy, with the silent loom rewinding time—no moralizing, only resonant image of "golden beads of fresh sap" holding future messages.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "shuttle clacked like a second heart" and cider-scented rot filter orchard through spinner’s embodied craft; rhythmic control under pressure ("threads rose likewise") avoids lyric drift despite dense imagery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "monsoons-warped box" and "nettle-pricked runes" achieve high density. One near-miss: "cider-scented rot and hush of time’s unraveling tapestry" risks overwriting but pays off via later "cider wind" echo at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes loom mythology with linguistic sacrifice into fresh emotional truth; "amber holding memory of wings" transforms cliché into indispensable motif. Risk-taking (silent protagonist) heightens stakes without gimmickry, fully committed to premise.</comment>
