<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation to strip “needless drama” is embodied in resisting anthropomorphizing the caterpillar and recording data as “vectors,” revealing her scientific rigor as both strength and limitation without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: the caterpillar’s silent work crystallizes Mara’s acceptance of slow repair, while “no villains, only vectors” reweights the flood’s meaning under Accumulative/Textural drive without soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse actively constrains choices (silted spectrometer window, toppled trellis) and charges the final image—dust spiraling in sunlight—proving environment-as-setting meets 9+ gate by reweighting the closure’s thematic charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mara’s data collection: shifted spectral peaks reveal climate adaptation, tightening her understanding of gradual change crossing thresholds; cost is felt in her humility when scales meet skin, narrowing her stance without false resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through dust patterns and neutron-star decay as parallel “patient arithmetic,” with the final image reweighting “gradual change” as both fragile and relentless—no moralizing, only the caterpillar’s quiet engineering charging the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: Mara’s neutron-star expertise filters observation (“motes swirl like galaxies”), with rhythm tightening during thunder; no head-hopping, and compression (“larvae hatching a week early”) deepens tension under Accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; “peacock blue against weather-raw skin” exemplifies high-density imagery. Only minor deduction for “kindled humility” slightly abstracting emotion, but cost is embodied in the caterpillar’s bristles powdered with dust.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of astrophysics and lepidopterology transforms climate change into tangible dust patterns; risk-taking in quiet climax pays off through the caterpillar’s charged reprise, avoiding derivative templates with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
