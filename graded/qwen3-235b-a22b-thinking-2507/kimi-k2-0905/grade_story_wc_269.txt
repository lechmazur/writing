<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "summons she was meant to follow" shows authentic tension between duty and curiosity, but the climax lacks visible struggle—her realization feels intellectual rather than earned through embodied cost like the "eel waking" metaphor promised.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "gate left ajar" crystallizes her role shift with conceptual cost ("never to prove loss but to remember the way back"), and the Accumulative lens holds through sensory density without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Micro-setting (tapping surfaces) constrains sub battery activation and charges the pillar rhythm, but the seafloor’s "ceremonial way" lacks tactile specificity—its limestone texture doesn’t alter her tactics during the swim.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mira’s agency: her decision to descend forecloses safety for truth, with conceptual cost crystallized in "remember the way back when the ocean was ready," though "summons" slightly tells rather than shows her choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the atlas page’s physicality and "Path 27" reframe witnesshood without moralizing; the final "gate" image resonates as a non-literal answer to erasure, avoiding false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "cartographic skin" and "sonar in the same cadence," with compression taught early (dive mask tears anchoring flashback) and paid off in the pillar rhythm’s tactile revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops in climax, but "delayed revelation stir like an eel" slightly overwrites with mixed metaphor; otherwise, propulsion is immaculate—sentences like "hydrophone in hand" compress action without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms climate tropes via "periodically eternal" motif and witness-as-archivist; the atlas page as physical key to data-stored reef avoids tech clichés, though "genocide" risks on-the-nose phrasing.</comment>
