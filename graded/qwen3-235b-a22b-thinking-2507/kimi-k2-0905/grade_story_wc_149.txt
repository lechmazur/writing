<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "lovingly venomous" precision—both apothecary daughter and boy mix poisons with care, yet the ghost's embodied grief ("tasted of her own dead mouth") and the boy's micro-choices under scalpel pressure reveal authentic, flawed agency. Final renunciation (stepping onto ice) earns cost through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the ghost dissolving "like salt into winter air" crystallizes the debt's conceptual cost (mercy as murder) under Accumulative lens. Orientation anchors by word 15 ("ashen-veil ghost bride... alchemical orchard"), and the mosaic shards (ephemeral cameos) cohere via bead's warming, teaching the pattern early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The carved bead functions as micro-setting that constrains every key choice—pruning, altar confrontation, ice-breaking—and charges the final image (sinking it drowns the tumor's blueprint). Sensory hierarchy is impeccable: mercury rain and rusted petals filter through the ghost's undead perception, never touristy catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when masters harvest the tumor: the boy's agency crystallizes in choosing the ghost's mercy over surgical "living pearl" extraction. Cost is unmistakable in "together they stepped onto the black water," where the bead's sinking reconfigures options under Accumulative pressure—no coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: "lovingly venomous comfort of a mercy that looks like murder" avoids moralizing while reweighting the debt across lifetimes. Final image (greenhouse dark, horizon band) offers resonant answer without stating a moral, leveraging the bead's prior symbolism organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: ghost's undead lexicon ("moon-dust that never quite touched soil") and rhythmic control under stress ("He hesitated, fear bright as lantern light") shine. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally to the boy's POV during climax, modulating with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves near-zero loops—only minor cadence rigidity in "roots feeding on alchemical sludge that glowed faint blue" slightly dulls propulsion. Otherwise, masterful density: "grief tasted of her own dead mouth" layers character, theme, and setting in one visceral line without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms gothic tropes through specific alchemical logic (tumor as "living pearl" for deathless trees) and emotional truth. The ice-breaking ritual feels inevitable yet fresh, synthesizing "mercy that looks like murder" through concrete action—not abstraction—while mournful elation charges the rebirth.</comment>
