<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Corin's internal conflict (scientific quantification vs. emotional weight) drives credible micro-choices, but "palette of resolve" abstraction slightly undermines embodied emotion during peak tension; Mira's "directed spontaneity" reveals layered motivation through gesture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: crushing the pocket-sun reconfigures "presence" with conceptual cost (ending his trade), while the transformed shell makes stakes undeniable; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Volcanic glass "sings" when light spreads, and the nautilus shell functions as micro-setting that constrains choices—final image charges the object with shared history, meeting the 9+ gate for environment charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Corin's confession ("selling absence") and the crushing act, narrowing options with visible cost (livelihood abandonment); agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens, though "secret-whispered" timeframe lacks tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image ("never need preserving because never captured") offers resonant non-literal answer to central question; theme emerges through shell's transformation, avoiding moralizing—pure subtext in Mira's tear-salt warmth and the singing glass.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("scientifically romantic mind," cooling magma voice-crack) modulates under stress; Mira's dialogue carries subtext ("You're late") while maintaining character-specific idiom without convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts—every line advances story ("volcanic glass sing" does triple duty); rhythmic control peaks in the crushing beat where syntax compresses without losing clarity or voice specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scientific/poetic memory frameworks; risk-taking in quiet climax (crushing light) heightens stakes coherently, with emotional specificity avoiding tropes ("holes where moments should be" redefines commodified nostalgia).</comment>
