<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Marisol almost drops the diamond but recalls her "shovel cut her hands" motivation; embodied shame via "copper and shame" avoids diagnostic labels. Backstory as debunker lacks deeper integration into present choices beyond stated motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: hanging the diamond broadcasts lies with visible cost (apples browning from truth's rot), reconfiguring "Paradise" under Accumulative lens. Slight causality hiccup in diamond playback onset—felt abrupt after ground opening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orchard's hexagonal scars constrain choices (matching letter fragments to find stillpoint) and charge closure via browning apples. "Poisoned apples" glow as micro-setting guides letter reassembly; environment actively shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Marisol's agency: humming the sign-off tone (not force) opens stillpoint, with cost legible in "tasted copper and shame." One meaningful escalation—letter reassembly revealing resonance access—narrows options decisively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: burying reassembled letters as "palimpsest" and truth rotting apples avoid moralizing. Final image reweights "comfortable lies" as corrosive force without stating theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "hexagonal scars matched tessellation of letter fragments"; rhythm modulates from clinical ("lead-lined gloves") to visceral ("copper and shame"). Minor register drift in "milk-white with black spear."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "dust drifts rose like ghost tides" exemplifies density. One paraphrase echo in letter reassembly ("grammar and paper grain guide her fingers" / "sailors read constellations") slightly dulls propulsion in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synthesizes radioactive orchard with truth-telling via stillpoint physics and archive-replicating scars. "Flaw shaped like a question mark" transforms cursed diamond trope through specific moral calculus, though liquidation backdrop feels familiar.</comment>
