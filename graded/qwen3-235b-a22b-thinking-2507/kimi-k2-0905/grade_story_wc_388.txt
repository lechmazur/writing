<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marisol’s internal conflict (“comfortable lies had grown teeth”) and embodied motivation drive every choice; the hexagonal scar observation showcases her sharpness with tangible cost during playback’s physical toll.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully: “truth accelerating rot” crystallizes the orchard’s decay with undeniable conceptual cost, anchored by the Accumulative/Textural lens from the shredded-letter reassembly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The orchard’s hexagonal scars constrain choices (guiding the letter reassembly) and charge the final image—browning apples proving truth’s corrosive power—elevating setting beyond atmosphere to causal agent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Marisol’s agency: reassembling letters deepens knowledge, the playback forces confrontation with shame, and hanging the diamond pays a visible cost (orchard decay) under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the diamond’s playback and final rot—no moralizing, just the visceral image of truth dismantling lies, reweighting the premise without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice’s percussive rhythm (“clicked like an angry cicada”) and character-particular diction (“confetti strips were the map”) persist under pressure, with sensory details filtered through Marisol’s debunker precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density (“lead-lined gloves, a magnifier chipped at the rim”) with propulsion—only a borderline mixed metaphor (“milk-white with a single black spear”) slightly muddles the diamond’s description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms radioactive wasteland tropes via the orchard’s lie-preserving logic; the diamond’s curse (perfect memory, not misfortune) feels inevitable yet fresh, risking emotional complexity over tidy resolution.</comment>
