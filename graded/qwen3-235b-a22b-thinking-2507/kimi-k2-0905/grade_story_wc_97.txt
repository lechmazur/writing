<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (waiting vs playing) manifests physically in chord resolution; micro-choice to leave loop earns renunciation with visible cost (surrendering the film's safety), though "steely longing" borders on label without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: choosing reality over the loop forecloses escape with felt cost (abandoning the film's "maybes"), crystallized by the clock's reclaimed chime. Orientation solid by para 1; Accumulative lens holds through atmospheric deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Broken clock functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (ticking in her arms), constraining choice via its frozen hands and liberated chime; tidal arbor actively pressures ascent/descent decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through deepening: the film loop reframes waiting as rehearsal, forcing a trade-off between safety and risk. Cost legible when she leaves the loop, but horizon timeframe lacks causal pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the clock/film mechanics; final chime reweights "waiting" as active creation without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by embedding insight in action ("surprise, like music, only needed one fearless note").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("reluctant pigeons," "flickering compasses"), but "strategically creative fingers" briefly drifts from pianist's lexicon. Rhythmic control sustains pressure through the ascent, though minor register slips occur.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Steely longing" risks label-speak but is redeemed by context; otherwise pristine propulsion. Deducted for isolated template cadence in "Hand over hand she ascended..." weakening immediacy during high-stakes climb.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms waiting trope through film reel mechanics: the "rehearsal" insight feels earned and specific. Emotional truth avoids abstraction, though tidal arbor edges toward symbolic convenience without sufficient grounding.</comment>
