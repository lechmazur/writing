<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "waiting was still a form of playing" and the clock's frozen chime versus heartbeat sync, but "surprise fate" motivation lacks concrete grounding in prior behavior; micro-choices like strapping the clock with silk scarf reveal values without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully when she resolves the chord and walks toward the shaft, with cost legible in the "reclaimed sound of time" choice; orientation anchors station setting by line 3, though projectionist's role slightly muddies causality in the tidal arbor beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Broken clock functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (ticking hands immobile but chime "free to summon arrival"), while "flickering fluorescent bars" and "ozone and wet cedar" sensory details constrain choices through embodied urgency; no generic placeholder setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the horizon deadline ("until the horizon invites night") forcing her to choose between looping "maybes" or real night, with cost crystallized in the resolved chord; agency drives escalation via her decision to descend, though the "flickering compasses" could pressure tactics more actively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through film reel metaphor as "rehearsal" rather than escape, with final image ("surprise, like music, only needed one fearless note") offering resonant non-literal answer; avoids moralizing by showing how "unplanned encore" advances her toward possibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "reluctant pigeons" and "restless castanets" diction; rhythmic control deepens under pressure as sentences fragment during ascent ("Hand over hand she ascended..."), though "strategically creative fingers" slightly abstracts the projectionist.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "steely longing" and "celluloid-thin, fluttering like a flag" achieve high density without figurative muddle; final line’s "rewrite everything after" lands with crystalline propulsion, though "cumulus pillows" borders on ornamental.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms waiting trope through film reel mechanics and tidal arbor setting; "flickering compasses" as drifting numerals offers fresh inflection on time’s fluidity, with risk-taking (film as escape route) heightening stakes coherently without gimmickry.</comment>
