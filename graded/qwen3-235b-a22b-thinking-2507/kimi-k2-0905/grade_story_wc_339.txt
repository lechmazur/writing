<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (analytic ritual vs emotional surrender) drives closure; micro-choice recognizing 1914 date earns release. Only minor deduction for near-theoretical insight before embodied action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: the "melancholy... like a violin chord" crystallizes surrender's weight. Orientation clear by line 3 ("barnacle-crusted threshold"), lens (Accumulative/Textural) held through magnesium flakes to final dissolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken library constrains every choice (rebreather dialogue, pressure gauges); snow globe functions as micro-setting charging final image. Atlas hollow proves environment alters tactics beyond postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Electra refuses to sink/fly, deepening via Elias' whisper about "confessing weight." Agency remains Mara's throughout; cost visible in trembling glove and buried trauma surfacing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete particulars: magnesium flakes as "unread telegrams," snow globe physics. Final image ("equation leaves solver lighter") reweights grief without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("static like unread telegrams," rebreather bubbles). Compression taught early ("sonar ping" establishing Earhart's wreck); voice modulates perfectly under pressure with zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "aluminum flakes swirling like constellations" achieves high density without muddle. Only microscopic deduction for "quietly analytic" label immediately redeemed by embodied magnesium imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "meeting Death" trope via marine archaeology specificity. Fresh inflection: grief as "physics of letting go" with actual equations. Avoids sentimentality by making Earhart parallel Mara's trauma rather than allegory.</comment>
