<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular ("eyes cataloguing how each volume had swollen then hollowed"); micro-choices like pressing dog tags into the globe reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Fred’s pressure forces stance crystallization without flattening Mara’s voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands decisively: "grief obeys conservation laws" reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density accumulation ("temperature of forgetting" measurements), with cost legible in the final recorder line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting (snow globe) constrains choice (only level surface for placement) and charges the final image (orbiting among shelves). Barnacle chandelier actively pressures the tiny plane’s movement, making environment integral to closure’s physicality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mara’s agency: measurements tighten to unscrewing the globe, narrowing options from analysis to release. Cost is unmistakable in the dog tags’ transfer and "background hum" realization under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the physicist’s journal ("observer loses mass, observed gains eternity") and final hypothesis reweight grief without moralizing. Ending offers resonant non-literal answer via snow globe’s slow revolutions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cathedral of salt-stained books") and rhythmic control under pressure; compression in high-stakes moments ("She did not look back") taught early and paid off. Zero head-hopping despite Fred’s presence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "books loosened their bindings and surrendered paragraphs" shows rather than tells. High density with clear propulsion—final line’s "quiet, sophisticated melancholy" crystallizes theme without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tropes transformed: Death as Fred ("not as reaper but companion") avoids sentimentality, while "thermodynamics of memory" synthesizes science and grief uniquely. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
