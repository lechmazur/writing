<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation crystallizes in final lie but boy's vanishing lacks causal friction; embodied contradiction in "routine as fragile varnish" anchors her wonder-preservation drive under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: coins orbiting then etching bees visually reweights "wonder" with tangible cost; escalation via ascent beats tightens options under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tower constrains every choice (no elevators, stairs, copper palms); "nectar dusk" hues reflecting in dead hive wax directly charge the final image with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving wonder) tightens meaningfully when truth-telling forces a lie; cost legible in levitating coins and opened gate, though blackout timeframe doesn't actively pressure tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (pocketing matchbox, whispering lie); final "wonder preserved" riddle avoids moralizing by being diegetic, though "spark that never burned" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("rust look sweet," "brass heart beat") persists under pressure; rhythmic control during ascent ("echoing like dropped coins") modulates intensity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops but "copper cones bristled like petrified sunflowers" creates minor figurative muddle in climax beat; otherwise high density with propulsion ("each step echoing like a dropped coin").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drone hive failure transformed into mythic stakes through specific details (melted wax wings, sulfur taste); emotional truth in "speak the lie you never told" outweighs familiar truth-telling trope.</comment>
