<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Kael’s "earnestly naive" persistence versus lukewarm magic; micro-choices like holding griefs in his chest to feed the bell charge the final endurance. Slight reflection depth loss as "studied dripping rates" feels tell-y versus embodied struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is flawless Earned Stasis: Kael’s death doesn’t undo the ocean because children sustain the ritual, with cost legible in "Kael’s bones rest beneath the viaduct." Drip-rate pattern (47→44) provides accumulative escalation that reweights stakes with crystalline precision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Viaduct constrains every choice—it channels dawn light to trigger the bell’s weeping, contains the reborn ocean ("wave crashed through the arch"), and becomes the ritual’s anchor. Final image of the 47-second drip charging fish birth proves setting charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten purely through accumulative pressure: drip-rate acceleration (47→44→doubling daily) narrows Kael’s options until the dolphin’s warning exposes devotion’s fragility. His endurance—"keeper of the drip"—forecloses escape with visible cost (white beard, death).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "brittle devotion" as widow polishing boots, minnows born from rust flakes. Final line ("a fish is born... because it must") reweights the premise without moralizing, answering "how belief returns" through resonant action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is immaculate: "tasted like iron and memory," drip-rate cadence mirroring sentence rhythm. Dolphin dialogue feels like Kael’s projection, avoiding head-hopping. Stress compression in "seven days" summary heightens pressure without losing voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels: "It didn’t ring. It wept." Final cadence ("Not because it makes sense. But because it must") crystallizes closure without muddle. Metaphors like "skin stitched from rust and regret" avoid cliché through specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "chosen one" trope via Kael’s incompetence ("spells fizzled"); "brittle devotion" as engine avoids inspirational clichés. Concrete impossibility ("oceans vanished overnight") grounds magic, while drip-rate mechanics feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
