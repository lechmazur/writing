<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority shines via embodied choices (pocketing warm feather, tearing atlas page) under pressure. Contradictory impulses—scientific rigor vs ritual surrender—converge in her refusal to record data, prioritizing muscle memory. Flawless micro-choices like the match strike reveal hierarchy of values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: the ghost's dimming and her departure crystallize reciprocal belonging. The Accumulative lens holds—density builds through copepod constellations until the city's "inhale" reconfigures stakes. Sunrise deadline tightens options without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The moon-pipe summit constrains her climax action—exhaling into water requires precise positioning. Rust, salt-eaten catwalks, and copepods charge the final image: bioluminescence illuminating ruins makes setting inseparable from thematic charge. Sensory hierarchy filters through her astrologer’s urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via protagonist agency: her ritual choices narrow options toward the sunrise deadline. The "rhythm of belonging" motive faces concrete cost when she tears the atlas—sacrificing data for embodied truth. One tightening (dawn’s approach) suffices, though secondary stakes could intensify pressure slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally: the paper bird’s ignition answers "rhythm of belonging" through reciprocal ritual. No moralizing—copepods settling on chalk constellations reweights prior ruins as "chord of welcome." Avoids thematic echo by embedding wisdom in action (exhaling breath into pipes).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "constellations ripple across black Atlantic skin" filters cosmos through drowned city. Rhythmic control shifts from meditative ("hummed with shadowseam wonder") to urgent ("dawn approached"). No head-hopping; Vesper’s pulse-speech contrasts her tactile narration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "silver bubbles" motif serves Accumulative pressure. Sentence rhythm varies ("Time, however, was tidal" accelerates tension). Minor register drift: "holographic sparks that settled onto her coat" slightly over-ornate for high-pressure beat, but payoff (re-weaving pinions) justifies it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms tropes: "burnt feather" becomes ritual ignition, not mere symbol. Fresh synthesis—astrology meets ornithology through "captivating ground to captivate sky." Risks lyric density but pays off with concrete stakes (dawn deadline) and emotional specificity (residual warmth in feather).</comment>
