<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction crystallizes in "Why did you turn left instead of right?" micro-choices; embodied guilt in ash-tasting avoids therapy-speak; final commission earned through tear-washed scars as "small dictionary entry for pain."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "not forgiven—innocence once bargained is never returned—but commissioned," crystallized in the spiral's "wet glint" projection visible to "anyone awake at 3 a.m. hurting."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Porcelain box constrains choices (warming in palms, fracture projecting moonlight) and charges closure; "tears salt-washing the burn ridges" transforms body into setting that shapes the final spiral inscription.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stake tightening when ash "darkened, softened, became ink" forces trade-off: swallowing ash vs. speaking scars; cost is irreversible ("innocence once bargained is never returned") made legible in "knees creaking like old shelter roofs" descent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: spiral drawn "syllable by blistered syllable" answers "Why does skin heal tighter than the soul?" without moralizing; "hard softness" reweights grief as a path widening outward.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("pines still smelled of last summer’s burn," "celestial bodies performed their slow dance") modulates under stress; rhythmic control in "He had once fought flames the way other men fought lovers—fiercely, recklessly" sustains tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold; "ash inside darkened, softened, became ink" compresses transformation into three verbs; final line "first word in the forest’s reply" avoids sentimentality while charging closure with ecological resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: fire's "verbs too quick to read" transformed into ash-water ink; specificity of "ridge fire crowned and jumped the line" avoids firefighter tropes; emotional truth in "grief if you walk it long enough" spiral.</comment>
