<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mireya's micro-choices (adhesive analysis, chain-as-bridge) reveal contradictory impulses; Corin's "dappled resolve" shifts to slack fingers. Final compromise earns cost via "trembling alliance of two fears" without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: gate's quivering hover crystallizes 70/30 trade-off with visceral cost ("warmth seep into her lifeline"). Causal lens holds—adhesive data directly enables calibration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Volcano constrains every choice: magma's "heartbeat" sets stakes, amphitheater fractures dictate measurements, steam tests the gate. Final "dappled resolve" glow charges closure—meets 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single tightening (dawn deadline → 30s thermal sighs → prime-number promise) narrows options to 70/30 ratio. Cost is visceral: "lifeline" warmth as earned trust, not abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Encrypted compassion" emerges through adhesive science → human compromise. Final "regulated breath" image answers "safety vs. rebirth" without moralizing—resonant non-literal resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "slyly heartfelt" for magma, "nervous confession" for chain tags. Corin's Gardener lexicon ("lock her heart") contrasts Mireya's precision; stress compresses syntax cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops: "basalt ribs expanding with thermal sigh" does triple duty. Final mid-action cutoff ("offered it to the") purposefully sustains Charged Poise—no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Encrypted compassion" reframes engineering as emotional decryption. Volcanic irrigation as renewal feels fresh; risk-taking (science as empathy) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
