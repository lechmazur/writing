<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ansel’s motivation is clear and embodied (“breath clouding, tracing cracks”), but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; micro-choices like reverse-assembly feel earned though closure’s cost (echoes staying) is externalized rather than internalized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the silver mirror reflecting nothing reconfigures time’s relationship to wonder with conceptual cost (“echoes chose to stay behind”), under a held accumulative/textural lens where density shifts reweight stakes through reflection delays.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The marble cavern’s reflective surfaces constrain every choice (angle studies, fracture examination) and charge the final image—echoes nesting in stone veins—proving essential to the closure’s resonance without symbolic overreach.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Ansel’s agency (dismantling, caliper measurements), narrowing options via the timer’s sound-sculpted gears; cost is felt through echoes thinning as they return, though the wounded season’s urgency remains atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the final image of seconds “fitting like tailored skin” reweights time as embodied rather than abstract, avoiding moralizing while answering the central question of wonder’s storage through Ansel’s cellar ritual.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (“peripherally focused,” “calipers of shadow”) sustains rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping, though “store wonder in cellar of reason” risks thematic echo but is redeemed by embodied context (whispered amid clouding breath).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density falters in minor figurative muddle (“jingle like distant cowbells heard through a fever”), but propulsion remains; no loops in closure beat, though “peripherally focused” repetition slightly dilutes momentum in mid-scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time mechanics (echoes as torque) avoids tropes through specific, lived details—scalloped metal, heartbeat-delayed reflections—yet hedging on the wounded season’s stakes prevents ultimate risk distinction despite strong emotional truth.</comment>
