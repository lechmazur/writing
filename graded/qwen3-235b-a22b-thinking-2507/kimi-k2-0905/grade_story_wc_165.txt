<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through Cass’s meticulous planning versus belief in wildness; embodied emotion in the bishop’s vibration like "heartbreak." Boy’s wide-eyed discovery earns his choice without sentimentality. Final endurance (leaving game open) forecloses control with saltwater’s cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: Cass’s departure crystallizes stakes—monotony cracked but wildness redirected, not caged. Cost legible in the abandoned bishop and "splash like a snare brush." Accumulative/Textural lens holds; density peaks when phones rise and the raven is claimed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tidal arcade constrains every choice: tide timing dictates bishop placement, saltwater adhesive, and the boy’s coin spiral. Final image (bishop moonlit on wet plank) charges closure by mirroring Cass’s philosophy. "Timber soaked in decades of salt" evolves causally with rising water.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (serenading monotony) tighten through Cass’s agency: her tide calculations narrow options to the moon’s peak. Cost is visceral—abandoning the bishop, donating the duplicate—to preserve orchestrated wildness. Coincidence (boy’s coin) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency drives the raven win.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "calculated wilderness" reweights at closure when Cass drops the duplicate bishop, showing design/chance as duet. No moralizing; the hollow bishop’s "Move me forward" and ocean’s refusal to cage wildness offer resonant, non-literal answer to creativity’s cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature: Cass’s analytical lens filters details (prime-number strobes, logarithmic spirals) into lyrical urgency. Rhythmic control peaks in "gull-cries chopped by wind" and "5/4 time" waves. Zero head-hopping; focalization tightens as tension builds toward the boy’s discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero scaffold: "saltwater film acted as adhesive" merges setting/action. Figurative language ("logarithmic spiral," "snare brush") charges pivotal beats without muddle. Minor overwriting in "half-life of carnival bulbs" (-0.1) but propulsion remains relentless toward the raven’s claim.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality in "orchestrated serendipity" as tangible craft: buskers as clockwork, rice-paper message. Fresh synthesis of chess, tides, and carnival mechanics feels inevitable. Risks mosaic-like choreography (three buskers) without gimmickry, heightening stakes through precise, non-obvious causality.</comment>
