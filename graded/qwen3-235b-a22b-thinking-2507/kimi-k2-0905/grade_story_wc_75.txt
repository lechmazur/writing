<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Aurelia’s embodied "rosewater dread" versus baking ritual; Milo’s collapse creates secondary pressure that forces her lute improvisation. Eleni’s off-page absence slightly weakens relationship crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: lanterns flickering to lute resonance crystallizes stance with visible cost (honey-slicked travertine). Accumulative lens holds—waterfall’s roar modulating into harmony reweights art’s utility without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Grotto’s limestone arteries actively constrain choices: Aurelia transforms waterfall noise into lute resonance. Emerald lens as micro-setting charges closure ("perspective is a choice"), meeting 9+ gate by charging final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Aurelia’s agency: baking "M" bread → fitting lens into lute → declaring "art is placement." Cost legible in guards’ boots slipping on honey, reweighting Council’s utilitarian stance under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "rosewater dread" reweighted as vibration in Eleni’s lute; final line’s unfinished "shaped like every" implies ongoing resilience without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite "rescue was not extraction" epiphany.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("silence clung like frost," "cardamom and survival") modulates under pressure. Voice distinctness in Milo’s crumb-catcher beard versus Aurelia’s "historically oriented" lexicon; no head-hopping in Hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "abyssal plunge pool" to "limestone arteries" shows textural specificity. One elevated phrase ("historically oriented weight of beauty") barely dents momentum in peak beat. Final line’s sensory propulsion ("warmth of baking bread shaped like every") perfects closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Rosewater dread" as embodied fear (not metaphor) transforms art-rescue tropes. Risk-taking—honey as resistance medium, opera glass as resonator—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in bread initials avoids generic resilience narratives.</comment>
