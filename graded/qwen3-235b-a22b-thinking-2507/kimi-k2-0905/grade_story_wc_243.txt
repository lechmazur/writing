<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Archivist’s contradictory impulses (preserve memory vs. surrender locket) drive the final choice; embodied grief in ink-seeping photo moment creates irreplaceable cost. Daughter’s gap-toothed photo grounds motivation without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: planting memories crystallizes stakes with felt cost (lost locket), reconfiguring "covenant" from stone to rhythm. Accumulative lens holds through inked barnacles → copper tube, pressure tightening via engine growls.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Jetty constrains every choice: covenant stones dictate sketching method, tide hiss forces speed, splinters demand "gently thorough" attention. Final image (copper tube as metronome) charges closure with sunflower/ink weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through proximate causes: loose board → security headlights, narrowing options until locket sacrifice. Cost legible in "steep absence like a clean nail wound" foreclosing preservation-as-keeping.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through jetty’s physical decay and covenant’s rebirth; "relocated to where it can keep listening" reweights memory as active verb without moralizing. Sunflower petals and ink become non-literal answer to loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature: "salt-rimmed plank remembered fishermen" filters world through archivist’s lens. Rhythmic control peaks in "ink blooming like bruised violets" under demolition pressure. Zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "gulls laughing like children who knew they were already ghosts" layers meaning without muddle. Slight register drift in "steep promise" costs 0.2 but closure’s "clean nail wound" redeems.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms preservation trope via negative-space sketching and covenant-as-rhythm. Risk-taking (time jumps, lyrical closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "relocated to where it can keep listening" feels inevitable.</comment>
