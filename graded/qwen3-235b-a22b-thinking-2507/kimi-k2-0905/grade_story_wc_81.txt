<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara’s shift from indexer to truth-seeker, embodied by the wrist imprint’s "tranquilly perceptive" sting and her tactile reordering of cards. Micro-choices under pressure—extinguishing the lantern, copying inverse glyphs—earn her renunciation of false history with palpable cost. Only slight cerebral overbalance in early reflection holds it below 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly: density builds via bruise patterns and rising water until the glyph’s revelation crystallizes erasure as the core truth. Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost—"hush of civilizations that had mistaken ink for immortality"—and the blackout’s physical stakes (knee-deep water, dimming light) make the conceptual price visceral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The flooded library’s micro-setting constrains every choice: water levels dictate time pressure, phosphorescent plankton enables the glyph’s revelation, and the final image of "cards whispering of dry earth" charges closure through bruised paper. Seawater isn’t backdrop but active antagonist, evolving from ankle-deep to knee-high to force Mara’s agency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten relentlessly through Mara’s agency: the blackout’s deepening darkness and rising water narrow options, while her "alternative hypothesis" (darkness as key) transforms knowledge. The conceptual cost—confronting erasure as foundational—is legible in her "dappled resolve," where light/shadow internalizes the city’s buried truth without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from bruised paper and inverse glyphs, avoiding moralizing. The final image—"cards now whispered of dry earth"—resonantly answers "What is honest origin?" by reweighting erasure as systemic violence. No thematic echo; insight arises from Mara’s tactile struggle with dented fibre, not abstract declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV voice is razor-sharp: "logical page indexer" syntax ("latent pattern," "taxonomy") fractures under pressure into sensory immediacy ("fingertips grazing indentations like reading braille"). Perceptual signature—filtering plankton through archival logic—modulates perfectly with rising stakes, and "tranquilly perceptive" avoids therapy-speak by embodying character-specific cognition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves near-flawless density: "water dripping from chandeliers like slow applause" weaves atmosphere into tension, and the lantern’s dimming mirrors Mara’s urgency. One hairline slip—"tranquilly perceptive" slightly abstracts emotion—but voice coherence and rhythmic control under pressure (e.g., short clauses during blackout) preserve propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality stems from transforming archival tropes: the ink stamp as erased city map feels inevitable yet fresh, avoiding derivative "chosen one" arcs. Emotional truth anchors the sunken-library premise in Mara’s quiet endurance, but the "dappled resolve" inflection lacks the transformative risk to breach 9.0 despite superb integration.</comment>
