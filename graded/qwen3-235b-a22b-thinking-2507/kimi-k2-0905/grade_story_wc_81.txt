<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in physicality (wrist imprint "listened to her pulse") avoids therapy-speak; contradictory impulses crystallize in final ledger choice with visible cost ("private pressure keeping false history at bay").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: relighting lantern to rewrite history forecloses erasure with conceptual cost ("false history at bay"), holding Accumulative/Textural lens through rising water and sensory deprivation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Water depth (ankle to knees) and lantern light constrain every choice; final image charges the flooded streets-as-headings motif with irreplaceable specificity ("cards whispered of dry earth").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single tightening—darkness enabling glyph revelation—narrowing options as water rises; cost legible when "reclaimed stillness" becomes active resistance against erasure in final steps.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image ("knowledge begins where silence is stamped back into speech") reweights erasure as foundational without moralizing; thematic cost embedded in Mara's "dappled resolve" rewiring.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines through occupational lens ("logical page indexer" noticing "bruised paper"); rhythmic control modulates with blackout pressure ("water dripping like slow applause" to neural static).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion via concrete verbs ("waded," "pressed," "relit"); metaphors ("kelp forests," "coral reefs") deepen setting without muddling closure’s phosphorescent revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival work and submergence trauma; bureaucratic precision ("readjust taxonomy") heightens stakes but erasure allegory edges toward familiar territory.</comment>
