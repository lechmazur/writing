<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines via concrete details ("proofs tangled in her hair") and contradictory impulses (logic vs. blood ritual). Motivation compels higher stakes through the blood-drop equation. Minor abstraction in "hope" concept slightly softens the cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost: "footprints already polished smooth by the next wave" crystallizes the endless cycle. Orientation clear by line 3; Accumulative lens holds through density buildup to the shell-message payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Grotto actively constrains choices (balloon descends despite "no opening") and charges the final shell message. Altitude gauge and shells/kelp recur as micro-settings that shape tactics, fulfilling the 9+ gate for environment charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Accumulative escalation: patterns → blood ritual → bursting balloon. Cost is unmistakable in the "endless cycle" imagery. Mira’s agency drives every turn—no coincidence resolves the revitalization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: the equation speech reweights into the final shell message without moralizing. "Altitude of the watched becoming the watcher" delivers a resonant non-literal answer to hope’s cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct ("logical dreamer" noticing patterns, equations in hair). Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure—e.g., short sentences during balloon descent. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance shifts feel intentional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; every sentence multiplies purpose ("brass needle quivering between realities" establishes setting, physics, and tension). Final line’s "constellations learning to sing" charges closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms "logical dreamer" trope via specific grotto physics and blood ritual. The shell-message closure feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking (math as hope currency) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
