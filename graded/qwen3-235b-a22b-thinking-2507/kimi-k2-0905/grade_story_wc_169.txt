<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between logic and hope is embodied in blood ritual and "serene upheaval," but lacks deeper tension; micro-choice (pricking finger) reveals values yet feels preordained rather than conflicted under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost ("footprints already polished smooth by the next wave"); orientation is flawless by word 5, and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through rhythmic pattern accumulation to the shell-sentence payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The tide-polished grotto actively constrains choices (kelp strands as frayed timelines) and charges the final image; micro-setting (altitude gauge, shells) directly shapes tactics and the closure’s heartbeat glow, meeting the 9+ gate decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (revitalizing consensus reality) are clear and escalate through balloon trials, but pressure lacks meaningful deepening; "serene upheaval" undercuts tension, and cost (footprints smoothed) feels earned yet not intensified by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete particulars (balloons, shell-sentence), avoiding moralizing; the final line "equations of hope drifted... like constellations learning to sing" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("equations in her sleep... proofs tangled in her hair") and rhythmic control under pressure ("calm hands moving while her mind churned"); elision of parallel timelines is taught early and pays off in the synchrony beat with zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("shells spiraling into new constellations, kelp braiding itself into wings") with clear propulsion, though "dawn before language" slightly muddles figurative logic in a peak beat without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "logical dreamer" trope through specific lived detail (equations in hair) and "serene upheaval" risk; the core synthesis—hope as altitude measured by observer courage—feels inevitable yet fresh, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
