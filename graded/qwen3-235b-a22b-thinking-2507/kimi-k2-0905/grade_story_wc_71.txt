<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in concrete sensory perception ("air tasted of ironed linen"), but Mireille’s "creeping normality" trait remains conceptual rather than embodied in contradictory impulses; micro-choices (backward shoe, paper boat) reveal values yet lack visceral cost escalation at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when the house "breathes easier" with conceptual cost (Mireille’s violet-taste epiphany), but escalation lacks a distinct mid-point intensification under the Accumulative/Textural lens; the ritual resolution feels slightly frictionless despite poetic execution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The orris root functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (sealing mouth, dissolving during ritual) and charges the final image, yet the quiet bay setting remains atmospheric backdrop without actively pressuring decisions or supplying resources that alter outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding sentient architecture) tightens through Mireille’s ritual agency, but the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt; the house’s "lonely for choreography" resolution lacks tangible tradeoffs, weakening the pressure arc despite coherent escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through displaced objects motif, culminating in the resonant CR where "creeping normality" reweights from threat to profound coexistence; the final "violet ghost" taste avoids moralizing while charging prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("streetlights hum when they daydream") and rhythmic control under pressure (shortened syntax during ritual) elevate tension; no head-hopping despite lyrical density, with voice modulating perfectly from observation to action in the paper boat sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in closure beat with high density ("paper touched glass, the vibration stopped"), but minor figurative muddle in "hush beneath the hush" risks coherence; the final "violet ghost" phrase demonstrates flawless propulsion and textural specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms sentient house trope through "choreography" lens and orris root mechanic; the paper boat ritual synthesizes premise, character, and stakes with bold specificity ("carpet sea"), making every detail indispensable to the closure’s emotional weight.</comment>
