<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("ground spirits" vs "cages ghosts") drives the pivotal choice; embodied emotion ("heartbeat as muffled knock") avoids labels; final renunciation earned by prior causality with visceral cost (vocation dissolving).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "I will no longer mend prisons" reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost (emptied vocation); Accumulative lens holds through knot unraveling; persistent constraint (accumulating silence) shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary constrains choice (light guides needlework) and charges closure (vixen leaping through unbroken glass); starlight's evolving role—from fractured colors to dispersal—reweights the setting’s meaning through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stake ("grounding spirits") tightens via agency (unraveling knots); escalation culminates in the fox mask’s desperate yelp forcing the final choice; cost (vocation’s collapse) is unmistakable in the crumbling mask and hollow name.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (knots storing swallowed words); final image of dissipating pawprints offers resonant answer to "mending prisons" without moralizing; avoids thematic echo despite profound insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("hush accumulated silence like tide pools") is character-specific; rhythmic control under pressure ("needle hovered, realizing...") modulates intensity; zero head-hopping despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("sigh wrapped around Mirel, adding weight to accumulating silence"); no figurative muddle in climax; "lucid unrest" refrain deepens meaning through variation, not redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "restoring artifacts" trope through specific logic (masks as prisons); emotional truth in the vocation’s collapse avoids generic wisdom; risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
