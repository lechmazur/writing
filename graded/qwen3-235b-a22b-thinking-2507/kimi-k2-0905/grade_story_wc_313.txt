<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (duty vs grief) manifest physically in pocketing then tearing the label; embodied emotion in "ankle-deep silt" and "red-rimmed eyes" avoids abstraction. Final renunciation of private pain for communal memory earns cost through tactile micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: tearing the label while photographing the town crystallizes stance with undeniable conceptual cost ("each scrap carrying private grief"). Accumulative lens holds as sensory accumulation rewires meaning without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Reservoir constrains choices (slippery path, silt depth); wind chime's restringing charges the final image. "Damp gauze" twilight and silt embody urgency, while the bar's physicality forces discovery. Micro-setting qualifies by shaping the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stake (truth vs pain) tightens when the photograph reveals her father's alternate life. Marisol's agency in destroying the label but preserving photos forecloses a path with visible cost ("red-rimmed eyes"), driven by Accumulative escalation of emotional density.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "museum of common loss" without moralizing. Final image ("living text, rewritten nightly") reweights the drowned town as shared memory, avoiding sentimentality while charging the central question of erasure versus preservation with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "twilight that clung like damp gauze" and "forbidden taste of anise and rain." Rhythm modulates under pressure ("boots skidding on slime"), with consistent lexicon. No head-hopping; compression taught early pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "metallic sigh" opening shows rather than tells. Stacked modifiers ("forbidden taste of anise and rain") serve voice without muddling. Final line recharges wind chime motif with perfect propulsion, though "mirrored hush" slightly edges abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "drowned town" trope through levee-warden specificity and "shared memory" angle. Emotional truth in tearing the label avoids generic templates, while "museum of common loss" synthesizes premise into fresh, inevitable insight without gimmickry.</comment>
