<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in micro-choices: pocketing the label as "evidence" then tearing it reveals self-deception about releasing grief. Embodied emotion in "boots skidding on slime" avoids label-speak. Final renunciation of private pain for communal memory is causally earned through the photo trail.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "each scrap carrying the weight of private grief" makes release tangible. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—photos deepen stakes without causal breaks. Orientation clear by line 3; wind chime bookends create causal coherence for the reflective shard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Reservoir’s draw-down pace actively constrains discovery (water retreating "one foot per day"), while the wind chime transitions from broken symbol to functional question. Final image of it "sounding like a question she could now answer" charges closure with environmental specificity, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize around communal vs. private memory. Escalation via photo trail deepens knowledge: birthday shots → father’s secret → her active choice to "expunge" scandal by building "museum of common loss." Cost is visceral in "tears rimmed red but voice steady," driven by Marisol’s agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: liqueur label, fishing-line photos, wind chime—not abstraction. Final image ("living text, rewritten nightly") answers "how do we carry loss?" without moralizing. Avoids false equivalence; father’s choice isn’t redeemed but contextualized within communal survival.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is engineer-daughter precise: "one deliberate foot per day," "4x6 prints clipped to fishing line." Rhythm modulates from sparse action ("locked up") to lyrical reflection ("twilight... like damp gauze"). No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under stress ("boots skidding on slime").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold. Opening line’s "metallic sigh" recharges in final chime notes with crystalline clarity. High density: "steeples resurfacing as draw-down continued" weaves setting/plot/theme. No figurative muddle—"damp gauze" twilight feels character-particular, not overwritten.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reservoir towns as palimpsests: draw-down pace as narrative engine, "museum of common loss" reframing grief. Emotional specificity avoids templates—Marisol’s release isn’t cathartic but pragmatic ("voice steady"). Transforms drowned-town trope through fishing-line photos and precise levee-warden logic.</comment>
