<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "tranquility is not absence of fire but mastery of its blaze," with embodied cost in swallowing the sphere. Micro-choices under pressure (stepping into brook, speaking the period) reveal value hierarchy. Lacks one clear contradictory impulse in peak moment to reach 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the swallowed sphere’s rotation makes conceptual cost undeniable ("private galaxy balanced between heartbeat and hush"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds from "mapping silence" through brook’s final "singing without code," with pressure tightening via prophecy’s drumbeat escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The quiet brook micro-setting actively constrains choices—stepping into water to lift cranes, syllables carried by flow—and charges closure as "polishing prophecy into smooth, meaningless pebbles." Sensory details ("cold gripping ankles like forgotten manacles") reflect urgency without static cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: the drumbeat’s "tasted copper" forces wading into the brook, with visible cost in swallowing the sphere. Pressure narrows options meaningfully when cranes "tessellating into a single sphere" demands the final act, reweighting silence as active protection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the sphere’s transformation: "tranquility is not absence of fire" crystallizes in the final image of "quiet flag planted in soil of morning," avoiding moralizing. Prophecy’s "smoothed hush" reweights silence as burdened mastery, with conceptual cost in the chest’s rotating galaxy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is singular: "moonlight glazed the water" and "whispered secrets exchanged between reeds" filter world through summoner’s pressure. Rhythmic control under stress compresses syntax ("He spoke one word—") without voice drift, teaching its lyric pattern by paragraph two.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "terrestrially cosmic" motif gains density without muddle. Final line’s "quiet flag planted in soil of morning" recharges prior silence with earned hope. One borderline dense metaphor ("tranquil blaze of moonlight") avoids penalty by being voice-motivated and paid off in dawn’s "birth of color."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms prophecy trope through origami silence-mapping: "babies cried in binary" and swallowing "prophecy like a stone coated in honey" ground abstraction in visceral stakes. Risk-taking with Accumulative lens heightens coherence, making "folded pause" protection feel inevitable.</comment>
