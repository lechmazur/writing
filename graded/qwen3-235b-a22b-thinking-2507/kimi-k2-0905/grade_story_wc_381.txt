<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in the summoner’s embodied restraint ("vacuum inside his own scream he never let out") and final swallowing of the sphere—a credible endurance with visible cost. Flawless micro-choices (pressing wing to sternum, stepping into brook) reveal hierarchy of values without diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: swallowing the sphere creates a "private galaxy" with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation clear by line 3; Accumulative/Textural lens holds. Minor deduction for the period’s inverse-code solution feeling slightly under-motivated as the prophecy’s sole counter.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Brook functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (stepping in, water carrying syllables) and charges closure ("polishing prophecy into smooth pebbles"). Sensory details mirror internal states without cliché—"copper taste" for code bleeding, stones forgetting stories by dawn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (hushing prophecy) tightens through protagonist agency: mapping silence narrows options, swallowing the sphere pays visible cost. Escalation via cricket-leg drumbeat and "tasted copper" intensifies pressure cleanly under Accumulative lens. No redundant loops.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image ("quiet flag planted in soil of morning") offers resonant non-literal answer to tranquility’s nature—mastery of blaze, not absence. Theme emerges from concrete actions (swallowing sphere) without moralizing. "Weight" of quiet murmuring against bone avoids false binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "terrestrially cosmic" refrains and "tranquil blaze" lexicon filter all observations. Rhythmic control under pressure peaks in "syllables arranged like constellations had spilled out, burning villages." Zero head-hopping; voice modulates perfectly to stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; high density ("paper thin yet stubbornly three-dimensional" does triple duty). Minor deduction for "terrestrially cosmic" repetition (4x), but patterned and payoff-justified. Final line’s cadence shift ("quiet flag planted in the soil of morning") crystallizes closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms origami trope via specific stakes (babies crying in binary) and fresh inflection ("." as inverse code). Emotional truth in "small, cracked smile" avoids sentimentality. Risk-taking (lyric compression) heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
