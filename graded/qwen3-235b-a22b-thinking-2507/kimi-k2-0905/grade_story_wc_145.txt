<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—Registry duty vs. witnessing truth—act simultaneously in her micro-choices (e.g., swallowing editor’s instinct to descend). Final renunciation (tearing the page) earns visible cost: career sacrifice for truth, rooted in childhood "where rivers begin" obsession.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: dissolving page transfers ink to microorganisms, making knowledge escape institutional control. Conceptual cost (Registry dismissal) is legible in "knew the Registry would dismiss it as myth," while the Accumulative/Textural lens holds via condensation spiral pattern taught early and paid off in descent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The phrasebook constrains choice (speaking "mayu" to liquefy ice) and charges the closure (torn page dissolving into microorganisms). Glowing water’s pulse spelling river words reweights the final image, making environment inseparable from thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Maren’s agency: her decision to descend forecloses safe return, with cost crystallized in "Registry would dismiss it as myth." Pressure accumulates texturally via condensation spirals and linguistic patterns, narrowing options to witness before data burial.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image—child dreaming of glowing water, cartographer pausing at warm spring—offers resonant, non-literal answer to "where rivers begin" without moralizing. Theme emerges from concrete particulars (Quechua "mayu" becoming living light), avoiding abstraction through microorganisms carrying ink toward oceans.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: cartographer’s eye for patterns ("condensation... forming a spiral") shapes diction. Rhythm modulates under pressure (short sentences during descent), with purposeful compression ("she spoke aloud... ice answered") taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "furnace to sigh itself cold" shows abandonment efficiently. Figurative language serves pressure ("lake stretched like shattered mirror"), and final line recharges "rivers begin" motif without muddle. Minor elevation in "puppeteered" justified by Maren’s lexicon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "convergence" trope through linguistic specificity (Quechua/Mongolian river words). Emotional truth in bureaucratic dismissal vs. subterranean wonder; risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, making synthesis inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
