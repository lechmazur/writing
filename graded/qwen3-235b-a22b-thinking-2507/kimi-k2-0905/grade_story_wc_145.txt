<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Maren’s “dry-witted” interiority shines through embodied choices (ignoring radio, speaking “mayu”) not labels; her “subtly confident” flaw drives the pivotal page-tearing with visible cost—Registry dismissal—while river-origin motivation fractures her cartographic duty. No therapy-speak; contradictions layer in her smile amid professional ruin.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: the transmitted map reweights “convergence” from Registry data-point to living interconnectedness, with cost legible in Maren’s “knowing the Registry would dismiss it.” Accumulative lens holds through condensation spiral’s reprise; falcon’s death tightens stakes without convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Frozen lake actively constrains choices (ice groaning under boots) and charges closure—refrozen seamless with spiral frost—while micro-setting (condensation patterns) guides descent like Braille. Every detail serves pressure: outpost’s rust mirrors Maren’s isolation, warm air defies physics to enable the falcon’s hover.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Registry vs. truth stake tightens when radio demands coordinates as she transmits the alternative map; her agency (tearing the page) forecloses career safety with felt cost. Minor deduction: “convergence” concept takes 30% to ground, but descent choice deepens knowledge into action, reweighting options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through river words glowing in microorganisms—no moralizing. Final image (“rivers knitting into a silver thread”) answers “where rivers begin” as interconnectedness, charged by the dissolving page carried to oceans. Quechua child dreaming shows earned resonance without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Maren notices cartographic details (“mislabeled tributaries”) and breath patterns. Voice modulates from brittle atlas pages to crystalline descent prose; “furnace to sigh itself cold” compresses setting/emotion. Zero head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early (condensation spiral) pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; “glowing water drank the paper” multiplies atmosphere/plot/theme. Rhythm varies: short clauses for tension (“Ice groaned”), flowing sentences for descent. One borderline elevated phrase (“puppeteered by warm air”) fits voice but costs 0.1; closure imagery (“frost remaining where shaft had been”) crystallizes with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms “hidden world” trope through linguistic specificity (Quechua *mayu*, Mongolian *gol*). Risk-taking—quiet concept-driven closure—heightens stakes: Registry dismissal vs. child’s dream. Fresh inflection in rivers “learning to speak,” avoiding generic environmental allegory via cartographic rigor.</comment>
