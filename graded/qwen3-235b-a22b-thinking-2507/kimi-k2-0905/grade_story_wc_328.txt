<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Vale's bitterness-turned-buoyancy, but herbalist lacks depth beyond catalyst role. Motivation rooted in mentor's static echo feels earned, though micro-choices during metamorphosis lack tactile specificity. Final renunciation of old life carries visible cost through "feet leave the earth—not in defeat."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: Vale's transformation crystallizes options with conceptual cost ("abandoned cryptid research"). Orientation secured early; frost-root truce anchors setting by 100 words. Cost proof evident in "bitterness into cosmic joke" reconfiguration, though lens ambiguity risk narrowly avoided.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frostbitten garden functions as micro-setting charging closure—floating rosemary and shattering glass directly constrain Vale's metamorphosis. Sensory hierarchy filtered through herbalist's "crushed pine needles" eyes elevates specificity. Cordless phone's "sparked antenna" slightly strains verisimilitude but redeemed by static's thematic role.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bitterness-to-levity transformation) tightens via mentor's static confession, foreclosing Vale's hunter identity with visible cost. Single deepening suffices: "laughter bending telephone wires" reweights options under Accumulative lens. Agency clear in "allowed arrowhead to guide," though herbalist's pressure lacks escalation beyond phone handoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—wraith as "part of you that laughs at the void"—avoiding moralizing. Final image ("question marks asking why we forget to laugh") delivers non-literal answer without stated moral. Emotional honesty in "frost crystallizing into laughter" dodges sentimentality, though "cosmic joke" risks abstraction without arrowhead's grounding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: gravity metaphors ("drunk marionette," "mocking moons") reflect Vale's researcher lens. Under stress, syntax compresses ("Static keeps roots honest"). Herbalist's dialogue distinct through earthy minimalism, avoiding convergence. Cordless phone's "sparked confessions" slightly violates POV lexicon but serves voice-motivated lyricism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "frost crystallizing into laughter" achieves textural density without muddle. Final line ("laughter bending telephone wires") resolves through image with propulsion. Minor register drift in "gravitationally playful waltz" but redeemed by rhythmic purpose. Figurative language coherent even in peak beats like arrowhead's "resonating" warmth.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms cryptid trope through emotional specificity—wraith as internal state avoids derivative horror. "Frostbitten hope" synthesis feels inevitable: bitterness as "final ingredient" reconfigures grief tropes. Risk-taking (static as truth conduit) heightens stakes without gimmickry, with closure image ("bridal train of frozen tears") embodying fresh emotional calculus.</comment>
