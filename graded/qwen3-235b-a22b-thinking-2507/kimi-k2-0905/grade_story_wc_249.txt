<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion ("soul stretched thin") but lacks contradictory impulses; rebellion is consistent without visible struggle against it. Diagnostic phrasing like "auroral sorrow" risks therapy-speak in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (merging into light) reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost, but the sacrifice lacks visceral legibility—"dissolution" remains abstract. Drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sound wave garden functions as micro-setting: crystalline reeds and auric lagoon constrain choices (drumming surfaces) and charge the final image (golden light dispersal). Sensory details evolve causally with the drumming crescendo.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through textural escalation (ripples→crescendo→dissolution), but cost remains conceptual rather than felt; Mara's physical dissolution isn't embodied with specific consequence. Agency-driven pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "entangled memories" as bridge not curse, but final image ("becoming the air that carried sound") states resolution too neatly, reducing ambiguity. Avoids moralizing yet lacks layered counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "liquid gold" water and "quantum foam" imagery; rhythmic control shifts from staccato tapping to flowing dissolution. No head-hopping, though reflection occasionally over-explains ("learned the garden's secret").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Template cadence in "drumming on everything" repetitions creates subtle loops; "tap-tap-tap" rhythm risks overwriting but pays off in crescendo. Final image ("photon carrying shared dream") avoids muddle despite high lyric density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantum physics and grief avoids sci-fi tropes, but "entangled memories" premise leans on familiar emotional scaffolding. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry (+0.3).</comment>
