<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in insomnia-as-lantern shift; Jules' silent presence forces Mira's endurance with visible cost in "leaves stuck to her shoes." Minor flaw: brush's magic slightly overpowers character struggle in climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly—"leaves stuck to her shoes" crystallizes conceptual cost. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds from first glyph to marigolds on windshields. No orientation debt; anchors clear by word 25.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse functions as micro-setting that charges closure: "leaves stuck to her shoes" directly stems from trapped ivy→pollen→breadcrumbs. Sensory hierarchy (saffron quiet, indigo steam) filters through Mira's exhausted hope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through glyph accumulation narrowing Mira's options to breath-as-transmission. Cost crystallizes when Jules inhales—"pupils showing mother's sandwiches"—making kindness a tangible burden. Single deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "remember me kindly" glyph→marigolds on windshields, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "lost languages" as actionable kindness without stating theme. "Strangers remember kindness" desire earns complexity via commuters' unconfessed smiles.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless: "sour glow" of smog, "pea and saffron quiet" reflect painter's exhausted hope. Rhythmic control peaks in "match struck in library" line. Zero head-hopping; Jules' dialogue-free presence heightens subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "indigo steam" slightly muddles but redeemed by orchids opening. Final line’s "moon-tipped and ready" avoids closure artifact. Near-miss: "conceptual cost" phrasing risks academic drift but held by context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "magical realism" trope through painter’s insomnia-as-fuel. "Lost languages via brushstrokes" feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (breathable glyphs) heightens stakes without gimmickry; marigolds on windshields epitomize specific freshness.</comment>
