<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's insomnia manifests as embodied urgency ("wrist moved without her"), but "to prove strangers remember kindness" lacks internal conflict; hitchhiker memory shows motivation yet no friction with her exhaustion. Micro-choices like setting the mirror reveal value hierarchy, but the idealism feels untested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: moonset, glyph drying as "remember me kindly," fatigue becoming "a blanket" with visible cost in her seventeen-hour sleep. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—air thickening to "throat learning to speak" reweights stakes through sensory density without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse constrains every choice: moon angle dictates reflection, glass traps indigo steam altering breathability. Final image of "leaves stuck to shoes" charging the pavement as "breadcrumbs" makes setting indispensable to closure’s emotional logic and thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finish mural before dawn) tightens via air thickening into "throat learning to speak," but cost remains atmospheric—no visible price paid during creation beyond fatigue. Escalation through sensory density succeeds, yet lacks a tangible forfeiture altering tactics mid-beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment>Final image of smog parting when people "exhale grateful syllables" reweights the premise with conceptual cost, avoiding moralizing. Marigolds on windshields and "remember me kindly" glyph deliver non-literal answers through concrete action, with no thematic echo or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "saffron quiet," "coins warm from palms that still remembered giving." Syntax modulates from moonlit semicolons to urgent fragments ("Footsteps clanged"), but "methodically hopeful" slightly detaches from embodied voice in one peak beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-loop in "thick with peat and saffron quiet" followed by "air thickened" slightly muddles density; "bruised marigolds" risks decorative overwriting. Otherwise flawless propulsion—similes like "match struck in library" charge momentum without slowing closure’s indigo steam.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "magic artist" trope through physicalized mechanics: indigo from rusted nails, lost languages as "birds inside eggs." Risk-taking (mural as breathable lung) heightens stakes coherently; marigolds on windshields feel inevitable in hindsight, not quirky.</comment>
