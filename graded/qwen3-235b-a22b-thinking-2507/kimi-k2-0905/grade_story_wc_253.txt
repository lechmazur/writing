<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("moral ambiguity as cloak") and embodied grief in whittling actions culminate in credible renunciation; officer's micro-choice to whittle reveals shared moral struggle without over-articulation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "soil darkened as if remembering rain" crystallizes grief's weight with undeniable conceptual cost; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through shavings-to-stems progression without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Wind turbines and dried bouquet constrain choices (shavings snatched, "dirge" labeling) and charge the final image; "turbine updraft" reappears to lift shavings as hope, then anchors the feather rebellion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through silence ordinance pressure: scraping risks hope charges, forcing "dirge" reframing; the single raindrop's vanishing carries felt cost that reweights grief's potential without resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "grief is soil" metaphor made concrete in planted stems; final line's "grief, having been cultivated, might now be allowed to weigh something" reweights mandate's legacy without moralizing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms dystopian tropes through specific grief mechanics: "lightness cultivated" via absurd narration reframes compliance culture; wind turbines as choreographers of hush feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
