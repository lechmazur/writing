<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Marisol's clandestine waivers versus ledger rigidity, with micro-choices like drafting receipt on cargo manifest revealing occupational texture. Near-diagnostic "compassion, like tide" phrasing slightly undermines embodied emotion, but locket transfer earns closure through tangible cost (warm imprint).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "compassion, like cargo, is only ever on loan" crystallizes options with visceral cost (empty locket imprint). Mosaic structure taught early via "cycle" references holds under Accumulative lens, though foreign currency feels convenient without prior friction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Library's salt-flapped card catalog actively pressures choices (open windows enable meeting), while final "crates stamped with invisible thanks" ties micro-setting to theme. "Shuttered kiosks/sleeping gulls" verge on postcard description without constraining action, narrowly missing 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through layers: mistaken address → derelict wharf → donor discovery. Marisol's internal conflict (disguised compassion) intensifies credibly, but external obstacles lack teeth; "whimsically attentive" trait doesn't constrain choices enough to maximize cost legibility under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through cargo/ledger metaphors without moralizing; "invisible thanks" on crates reweights premise non-literally. Final image avoids sentimentality by grounding in dock laborer reality, though "compassion, like tide" borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV control is masterful: "card catalog drawers like gull wings" shows character-particular perception. Tense stability and rhythmic control under pressure excel, though "reverberated in the hush between heartbeats" slightly overwrites with authorial voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "salt wind flapped... like gull wings" does triple duty (sensory/atmosphere/motif). "Face lit by lightning" borders cliché and "confetti" for starlight feels dissonant, preventing 9.0 despite exceptional density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "kindness chain" trope through maritime logistics lens; specific demurrage fees and NGO pennant avoid generality. "Invisible thanks" insight feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in quiet closure heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
