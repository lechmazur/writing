<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in concrete action (waiving fees as "clerical error"), embodied emotion via locket study, and credible endurance (log entry as "value immeasurable") with visible cost—loss of photo yet sustained commitment. Micro-choices under pressure (delivering envelope) reveal hierarchy of values without over-tidiness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "value immeasurable" log entry crystallizes cyclical compassion with conceptual cost (parting with locket), under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors by word 20 ("seaside cargo broker," "dusk," "band-shell"). Cost proof evident in "imprint warming her palm" as tangible consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (locket photo) constrains choices—Marisol studies it "the way others pray," later gifts it to Beto, charging the final image ("imprint warming her palm"). Sensory details (salt wind flapping catalog drawers "like gull wings") reflect urgency while avoiding cliché; professional bias shapes attention (harbor rezones, cargo manifests).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uplifting silent contributors) signaled via envelope's foreign currency, tightens when Marisol drafts receipt on cargo manifest—agency narrowing options (bureaucratic action enabling NGO legitimacy). Cost legible in locket's physical absence and "invisible thanks" crates, though secondary stake (personal connection to mother) lacks sufficient friction with primary.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "compassion, like cargo, is only ever on loan" crystallized in locket transfer and "crates stamped with invisible thanks." Avoids moralizing by embedding wisdom in action (waiving fees, log entry), though "invisible thanks" borders on abstraction without deeper contextual grounding in dockhands' lives.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Marisol notices "clerestory windows stayed open to stars," "card catalog drawers like gull wings." Rhythmic control under pressure ("exchanging stories without surnames") with purposeful compression taught early. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentional during locket reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-loop in "reminding herself that compassion, like tide, must return" followed by "compassion, like cargo, is only ever on loan" slightly dilutes propulsion. Otherwise impeccable density: "constellations printed on the ceiling glimmered over empty tables" conveys atmosphere, isolation, and thematic weight in one stroke. Final line recharges "symphony" motif with "hush between heartbeats."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms maritime tropes via specific logic: demurrage waivers as disguised compassion, "Wharf of the Lanterns" as obsolete yet spiritually resonant. Fresh inflection in locket-as-cargo metaphor; "invisible thanks" crates synthesize economic and emotional systems. Avoids abstraction through dockhand meal stipends and cargo manifest receipts.</comment>
