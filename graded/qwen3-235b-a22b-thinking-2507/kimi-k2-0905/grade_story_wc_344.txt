<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rowan’s grief-driven quest for repair rhythm manifests in embodied choices (flawed key handling) and contradictory impulses (doubt vs. hope), but his interiority lacks deeper conflict beyond mentor loss; the final renunciation of escape feels earned yet slightly under-layered by mid-story stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the door’s heartbeat click crystallizes Rowan’s acceptance of irreversible repair, with visceral cost in vanishing exit and ticking clocks reconfiguring his grief; Accumulative/Textural lens holds via mirror repetitions tightening toward the key-healing reversal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The hall of mirrors functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice (storing "better versions" enabling key repair) and charges the final image (driftwood workshop); every sensory detail—from rime-crackling coat to auroras braiding overhead—serves urgency and character-specific perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Rowan’s agency: his realization about mirrored "drafts" forces the key-healing choice with visible cost (surrendering escape), but the singular tightening lacks a secondary pressure point to elevate beyond strong execution; lunar rhythm motif deepens the dominant repair stake effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (mending the key to mend the self), avoiding moralizing; the final image of inward-ticking clocks offers resonant, non-literal resolution to "forgiving the gear that slipped," reweighting grief as custodianship without abstract commentary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature shines in tactile, gear-focused lexicon ("crescent cogs," "tooth sheared") and rhythmic compression under stress; voice modulates perfectly from lyrical ("soft hush of a distant morning") to visceral ("doubt hissed like thawing steel"), with no POV leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density without muddle—"frost racing along the shank" merges action/image—but minor scaffold appears in "hauntingly bright" repetition (three uses); no closure artifacts, though gear-assortment description risks slight overwriting in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specific logic: mirrors store discarded drafts, not illusions; lunar-eclipse locksmithy grounds metaphor in tangible mechanics. Emotional truth in "forgiving the gear that slipped" avoids genericity, with bold structural risk (hall’s pattern taught by 25%) paying off in closure.</comment>
