<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rowan's interiority is concrete ("heart ticked irregular") and flaw-driven; the key micro-choice (aligning broken key with reflection) earns closure through embodied causality without diagnostic labels. Minor deduction for slightly facile realization about mirrors storing "better versions."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the vanished doorway imposes visible cost while "heart finding rhythm" crystallizes emotional reconfiguration. Orientation anchors by word 20 ("frozen library above clouds"), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through fractal reflections to the final tick.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The frozen library constrains every action (squealing boots, frost-beaded pins), while the hall of mirrors functions as micro-setting that directly charges closure—the healed key emerges from its glass. Cedar shards and moon-dials evolve causally to enable the workshop revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes ("rhythm of repair") tighten through the mirror sequence, narrowing options to one irreversible choice: placing the flawed key against glass. Cost is visceral as frost seals the crack, altering tactics for the final turn. Agency drives every escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "to mend the world you must first forgive the gear that slipped" resonates via the healed key and inward-ticking clocks. Final image ("apprentice no longer but custodian") reweights the premise without moralizing, avoiding all anti-patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct ("breath unfurled as silver gauze," "auroras braided overhead"), with rhythmic control shifting from clipped tension ("None sang") to lyrical resolution. Single-POV consistency and compression ("fractal chorus") are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "frost racing along the shank" exemplifies triple-duty prose (action, setting, emotional metaphor). Figurative language avoids muddle even in peak beats ("silver gauze" breath), with sentence rhythm accelerating during the gear test sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specificity: lunar-eclipse locksmith identity defines the flaw (irregular heartbeat), while mirrors storing "discarded drafts" reconfigures a cliché. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring the earned closure.</comment>
