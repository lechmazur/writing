<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Archivist’s motivation crystallizes through tactile ritual ("key, needle, whisper"), but lacks contradictory impulses—her calmness borders on implausibility during high-stakes transmutation. Interiority stays embodied ("breathed so slowly it stayed"), yet no visible struggle tests her belief in pain-to-masterpiece alchemy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the dove mosaic reconfigures pain into collective healing with undeniable cost ("pain not erased but folded into beauty"). Accumulative lens holds—each photo alignment tightens the spiral’s meaning, culminating in the town’s exhale as conceptual cost. Orientation anchors within 30 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lavender field and map case constrain choices (kneeling to align photos, unused space as "tomorrow"), charging the final dove image. Sensory specificity shines ("iron and honey," "salt instead of nectar"), but rust’s late chuckling feels slightly forced. Micro-setting elevates beyond atmosphere to active constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through archivist’s ritual: transmuting pain requires precise photo arcs, narrowing options until the dove emerges. Cost is legible in her labor ("tweezers finer than eyelashes"), but escalation lacks a live option foreclosure—pressure builds cleanly yet without a palpable trade-off that tests her limits.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "pain folded into beauty sharp enough to cut fresh gratitude" reweights transmutation without moralizing. Final dove image answers the central question through charged specificity, though early belief statement ("pain could be transmuted") slightly telegraphs. No thematic echo in closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable—"fingers tasting every crack," "scent of diesel remembered"—with rhythm modulating under pressure (slow breaths during bee encounter). Single POV remains stable, though "town exhaled together" risks overreach beyond archivist’s sensory scope in the final line.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "curling like autumn lips" risks mixed metaphor but pays off in photo arcs. Final line’s cursive footprints verge on ornamental, yet "linger longer" resonates with "collective healing" stakes. "Penny candy" simile slightly jars lexicon but doesn’t obscure closure’s charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms archivist trope through tactile method (arcs as constellations) and lavender/rust synesthesia. Emotional truth in "crowd enough to ache" avoids sentimentality, but factory ghosts remain slightly archetypal. Risk-taking (lyric mosaic) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though closure feels almost too effortless.</comment>
