<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Nara's embodied flaws ("knees screaming," tomato-blushing telepathy) and contradictory impulses (rebel vigor vs. aging body) drive micro-choices under pressure. Slight deduction for embryo-alteration ease lacking tangible struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: plants' "conspiratorial pride" reconfigures destiny with visible cost (screaming knees, council's ignorance). Orientation anchored by word 15; causal lens holds relentlessly from kite discovery to final walk.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Volcanic springs constrain choices via precise 52° threshold and pollen resources, charging the final image. "Mineral clouds swirled like galaxies" exemplifies purpose-driven specificity that shapes tactics without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when the guard appears—Nara must act within minutes, trading safety for epigenetic alteration. Cost is visceral (knees, time) and conceptual (council's ignorance), driven entirely by her agency under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "grow curious" mantra vs. council's quotas, crystallized by the child's "why." Final image answers "what is destiny?" without moralizing, using plants' rustling as resonant subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("chlorophyll memory," "synthetic amniotic revival" slightly jars lexicon). Voice modulates under stress—short sentences when guard appears—while maintaining distinct rhythm ("mineral clouds swirled like galaxies").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "photosynthetic panic flared" risks personification but gains coherence from established telepathy. Zero loops; final line "stubborn intent to evolve" recharges motif with earned concision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via volcanic epigenetics and "accidentally telepathic" specificity. The "why"-saying child feels inevitable from prior details (kite script, grafting), avoiding derivative safety with bold biological stakes.</comment>
