<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in micro-choices (peeling ring while feeling heartbeat); cost legible in "poorer in pride." Minor blind spot development gap weakens flaw compounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("richer in doubt") under Accumulative lens. Orientation anchored by line 3; "hollow artifact" crystallizes stance without soft reset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cedar plaque constrains choice and charges final image; tail tips function as micro-setting. Slight vagueness in workshop spatial choreography prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake tightening via shedding layers forecloses path (immaculate reputation); cost visible in dead lizards and pride loss. Agency-driven escalation lacks one visceral pressure point.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image ("tenderly cracked open") reweights premise without moralizing. "Reconstruction begins with visibility" slightly over-articulated but redeemed by concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("minute heartbeat pulsing through scales"); rhythm modulates under stress. Brief register drift in "reconstruction" phrase costs 0.2.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; "clinked into glass dish" exemplifies textural propulsion. "Method came as surrender" slightly clichéd but offset by concrete actions in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wildlife biology and moral reckoning; "compass of grief" transforms trope. Emotional specificity elevates beyond premise familiarity.</comment>
