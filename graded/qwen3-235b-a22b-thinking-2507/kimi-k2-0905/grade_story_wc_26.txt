<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (preserve vs. release hope) drives Mira’s final choice to internalize the stone, with embodied cost in her vanishing. Mother’s off-page presence intensifies stakes without headcount clutter.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: Mira locking her heartbeat into the vault forecloses her path with visible cost ("became the last dusk itself"). Accumulative lens holds through density shift as orchids release "pollen that glowed with luminous regret".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>River stone functions as micro-setting that charges closure—evolving from "matte gray" to "tiny planet" and constraining Mira’s final choice. Orchid-shelves’ "petals folding" mirrors her vanishing without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when the stone warms unexpectedly, forcing Mira’s agency shift from cataloguer to preserver. Cost is legible in her self-erasure: "lighter by one river stone and heavier by one story".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the stone’s metamorphosis—hope preserved "unshareable" avoids moralizing. Final image ("woman had chosen to house... hope inside her own vanishing") reweights premise without stating morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer" noticing "precise shade of violet") with rhythmic control under pressure. "Luminous regret" motif modulates from description to embodied feeling in the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "shadow unbound" repetition slightly dulls climax intensity. Otherwise, high density: "surface rippling like water remembering its source" does triple duty without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of climate grief and archival labor—drowned world below transforms "blooming library" trope. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring Mira’s concrete choice to internalize hope.</comment>
