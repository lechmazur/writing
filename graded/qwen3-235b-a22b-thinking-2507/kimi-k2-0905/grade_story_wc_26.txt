<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through Mira’s scholarly duty versus daughter’s promise; embodied "shadow unbound" as second heart avoids therapy-speak. Final renunciation—locking hope inside herself—is earned by decades of cataloguing and the stone’s warmth, with cost crystallized in her vanishing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly: stone’s metamorphosis narrows options toward Earned Stasis. Cost is visceral in "folding hope and regret together like wings" and Mira becoming "the last dusk itself"—a resonant reconfiguration where closure’s conceptual price (her erasure) reweights the premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The river stone evolves from memory-keeper to planet, constraining every choice; orchid-shelves releasing "archived dreams like pollen" directly enables the closure’s dream-stitching. Final image of Mira as "violet afterimage" charges the micro-setting with irreplaceable cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (preserving unshareable hope) tightens when the stone warms unexpectedly, forcing Mira to confront her mother’s choice. Agency peaks in setting the stone between projectors—her decision to internalize hope over releasing it carries undeniable cost: her physical vanishing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: the drawer label "Hope, unshareable, shape preserved" avoids moralizing, while the final image of mother/daughter watching "the same unmoving stone" reweights hope’s cost without abstraction. No thematic echo—only earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer," "light bruise the horizon") filters all details through Mira’s cataloguer’s precision. Rhythm modulates under pressure—lyrical ("continents of silver regret") to sparse ("sky was empty of color")—with zero head-hopping. "Luminous regret" tone deepens organically.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "orchid-shelves opened their petals wider" slightly strains personification, and "Mira understood then that..." borders on scaffold. But "folding hope and regret together like wings" crystallizes dualities with zero loops, and closure lines ("blank reel waiting") radiate density without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms "preserving memory" trope via the stone’s metamorphosis and dream-market critique. Risk-taking in quiet closure (Mira’s erasure) heightens stakes—her vanishing reweights hope’s cost without gimmickry. Specificity ("matte gray" to "glimmered with starlight") avoids abstraction.</comment>
