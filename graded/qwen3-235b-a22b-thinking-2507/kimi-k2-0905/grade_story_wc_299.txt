<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "confidently uncertain" gestures and the grille cloth pocket ritual; embodied emotion avoids therapy-speak as Mara's fossilized dreams manifest in inventorying stone. Only minor deduction: high school call feels slightly abrupt despite prior setup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly—quarry horn rolling "like the last chord" crystallizes Charged Poise closure with visceral cost in limestone dust's "bitter" taste. Orientation anchored by word 12; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quarry setting actively constrains choices: crusher clang triggers memory, dump truck notes become chords, dust embodies "mineral promise." Micro-setting mastery—grille cloth's orange speck charges the final image. Minor deduction for "loyal dog" simile.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single stake (purpose after failure) tightens through sensory triggers: horn → resonance realization, cloth speck → "being needed" epiphany. Cost legible in fossilized state and bitter dust. Agency peaks in chair-kick moment foreclosing resignation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"After the applause" theme emerges purely through limestone foundations and workshop offer—zero moralizing. Final image reweights applause as "mineral promise," avoiding sentimentality. Orange speck memory delivers non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless: roadie jargon ("snare hit," "cymbal crash") filters all description. Sentence rhythms mirror emotional shifts—lyrical for reflection, staccato for action. Zero head-hopping; even foreman's dialogue serves Mara's focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "trembled between her palms like it still remembered the roar" shows rhythmic control. Strategic telling compresses backstory efficiently. Minor deduction for "hush... loyal dog" simile slightly straining texture in mid-beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "fallen star" trope via roadie-to-appraiser specificity. Fresh inflection: purpose defined as "meticulous, generous, alive." Avoids cliché through quarry physics → workshop pivot. No derivative elements; emotional truth anchors universals.</comment>
