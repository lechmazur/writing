<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Garnet's contradictory impulses (obedience vs invention) manifest concretely in her graphite lock-picking and false surge report to Voss; embodied emotion peaks when she recognizes "the face of every child told the dark was forever" in the generator's glow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when sky-barges drift free against kindled stars—the cost is visceral as Voss locks the cage while the revolution succeeds; causal escalation (sundial codes → rewiring → barges freed) holds flawlessly under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The luminous fort’s blackout and copper coils actively constrain choices (rewiring requires darkness); the bronze quill holder charges the final image as Luce raises it "like a candle," transforming a Ministry relic into revolutionary beacon.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally: lock-picking forecloses obedience, rewiring risks capture, and freeing sky-barges sacrifices the fort’s anchored safety; the felt cost crystallizes when Voss "complies" to shut the breaker, killing Garnet’s spark but passing the secret.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "we write tomorrow with light" resonates from graphite rewriting borders to quill holder conducting aether; the neutral banners at dawn reweight tyranny without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice modulates under pressure: "Footsteps again, heavier" compresses syntax during Voss' arrival; Garnet’s perceptual signature ("bruised violet" sky, "moth-wing" footsteps) filters all description through sentinel precision without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence propels action ("She set the timer... relays would close"). Final line’s "secret smile" recharges the opening "winking hush" with crystalline precision, avoiding figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Revolution tropes transformed via specific mechanics (graphite lock-picking, aether valves); the "cradle of sparks" concept feels inevitable yet fresh, with risk-taking (lyric closure) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
