<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "writing obituaries for the living" as both compulsion and self-erasure; micro-choices like winding thread reveal hierarchy of values. Final renunciation (empty notebook) earned through accumulated embodied cost but secondary pressure lacks depth with single character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("notebook empty for first time") under Accumulative lens; orientation anchors by sentence one. Lens holds perfectly though micro-turn density slightly dilutes escalation pressure at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Autumn garden's leaf patterns constrain choices (writing names in dirt) and charge final image; thread functions as micro-setting. Sensory hierarchy masterful but weather's impact on action remains underexploited despite thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by protagonist's agency (winding thread) under Accumulative lens with visible cost in identity transformation. Single tightening suffices but dominant stake ("geography of healing") could deepen internal/external conflict interweaving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "explained absences" becoming presence; final path inscription offers non-literal answer to central question. Avoids moralizing but secondary stake about ordinary life remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "leaves arranged like words"; rhythmic control intensifies during projection scenes. Minor register drift in "geography of healing" phrasing slightly jars lyrical consistency under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances story with textural specificity ("ink-stained fingers trembling"). Figurative language ("shadows deepening until portals") remains precise even at climax—peak of line-level control for this length.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "obituaries for living" with carpet-weaving metaphysics feels inevitable; "lonesome splendor" tone transforms cliché of healing journeys. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry though emotional calibration edges toward tidiness.</comment>
