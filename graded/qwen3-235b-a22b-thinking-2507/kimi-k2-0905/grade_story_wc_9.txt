<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in visceral grief (imaginary tea, vanished handprint), but "daughter never tasted" creates slight causality ambiguity around the loss. Contradictory impulses (seeking/avoiding time) power choices like tracing hands on clouds. Embodied emotion avoids labels; micro-choices under pressure earn the final endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: time floods back as "years of lullabies... flooding her lungs" during descent. Orientation clear by word 30 ("midnight glade above clouds"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—crack widening to canyon deepens the stake with every porcelain voice. Only hairline slip: "the choice" lacks immediate causal anchoring.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The saucer crack functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (healed seam as "closed eye"), but the glade itself remains atmospheric rather than constraining choices. Sensory hierarchy excels ("moonlight tasted of sugared milk"), yet the cloud cathedral doesn't actively pressure tactics until the descent. Misses 9-band for lacking persistent environmental constraint earlier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency: spreading cards narrows options as the crack becomes a canyon of voices. Escalation is relentless—"time rushed back... until she laughed and wept simultaneously"—with cost unmistakable in the choking beauty of imagined moments. Dominant stake signaled late (para 3), but the deepening reweights options with visceral precision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "every fracture is only a doorway shaped like a question mark" reweights the saucer crack without moralizing. Final image (saucer as "closed eye" offering tea) answers the central question of lost time through action, not assertion. Avoids sentimentality by embracing ambiguity—"daughters never finish growing up" lingers as earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("boots leaving no print on silver moss"), but "willingly perplexed" appears as label twice without embodied cost. Rhythmic control under pressure is masterful in the descent sequence. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" territory, yet voice modulates perfectly with emotional intensity through the time-flood climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion soars ("time rushed back... flooding her lungs"). Only flaw: "choking beauty" repeats within 5 lines during peak pressure, triggering a -0.3 Overwriting penalty. Figurative language stays coherent and purposeful, but the micro-synonym loop in the climax prevents 9.0 despite otherwise immaculate density and rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes through specific logic: time pools "beneath fingernails of the dying," clouds as cathedrals of regret. The "unfasten grief like a necklace" image synthesizes emotional truth with fresh metaphysics. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry—every detail serves the premise’s implications.</comment>
