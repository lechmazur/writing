<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in concrete actions (tracing hand in cloud, unfastening cards) avoids therapy-speak; contradictory impulses (grief vs. hope) manifest through porcelain voices and time’s flood. Micro-choice to speak the name earns closure, but "choking beauty" slightly edges toward label-speak without sufficient embodied degradation under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: landing with healed saucer reconfigures time’s meaning with visceral cost ("lungs filled until she laughed and wept"). Orientation anchors by 120 words; Accumulative lens holds as density (accumulating voices, widening crack) tightens stakes without causal breaks. Minor cost proof gap: conceptual weight of "stolen seconds" slightly abstracts physical toll.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Silver moss, saucer crack, and cloud cathedral function as micro-setting constraining every choice (cards spread on fracture, tracing in vapor). Final image of healed seam as "closed eye" charges closure with irreplaceable specificity. Sensory hierarchy masterfully narrows under stress (labor minutes as doll voices), avoiding overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming lost time) escalates through Accumulative density: crack widens, voices multiply, cloud descends. Agency-driven deepening via tracing hand in cloud forces stance crystallization. Cost legible in time’s flood, but escalation leans slightly on atmospheric pressure over protagonist’s tactical adaptation under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges solely through particulars: "fracture as doorway" reweights birth trauma without moralizing. Final saucer offering answers central question through action ("invited the night to tea"), avoiding sentimentality. "Choking beauty" paradox crystallizes grief’s duality, though "love refuses to end" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "moonlight tasted of sugared milk gone cold" filters world through maternal grief. Rhythmic control under pressure (short clauses during time’s flood) avoids ventriloquism. Zero head-hopping; "willingly perplexed" repetition taught as pattern. Slight register drift in "conceptual cost" near closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "porcelain voices rose, asking why Mommy never finished the tea party" achieves triple duty (character, setting, stakes). Final line’s "sipping imaginary tea with children who exist forever in the choking beauty of almost" perfects cadence. One near-miss: "choking beauty" repetition risks slight dilution in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via "cloudbound repentance" card and time-pooling mechanics. Emotional specificity in tea-party voices (3:42 a.m. labor start) avoids generality. Risk-taking (cloud as cathedral of regret) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "fracture as doorway" synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
