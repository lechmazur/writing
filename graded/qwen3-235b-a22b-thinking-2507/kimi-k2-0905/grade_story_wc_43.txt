<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s micro-choices (pressing vinyl to pulse, hymning mundane sounds) embody "decisively kind" through action, not label. Calderon’s traced vinyl edge reveals lifelong regret with embodied contradiction. Only minor lack of deeper internal conflict in Mara’s final moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "reunify does not mean repair" crystallizes meaning with undeniable conceptual cost (carrying brokenness). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—sensory density tightens into final realization. Zero causality breaks; cost legible in flattened monitor and shard placement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (vinyl shard) charges closure: its reunion against Mara’s sternum transforms "scent of hope" from memory to active philosophy. Glass-floor clouds mirror emotional liminality but don’t constrain choices—object elevates it to 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (flawless goodbye) tighten via Mara’s agency: kalimba shifts from hymning mundane to scent of hope as Calderon declines. Cost is visceral—his death and Mara’s acceptance—made unmistakable by "monitor flattened into a quiet ocean" and velvet darkness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final realization reweights "reunify" without moralizing: "carry both pieces forward" emerges from vinyl’s physical reunion, not abstraction. Avoids sentimentality; Calderon’s "never learned to end things clean" earns thematic complexity through gesture, not thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: Mara filters world through sound ("squeak of nurse shoes... transposed into sound"). Syntax compresses under stress ("She inhaled the scent of hope—warm vinyl, distant rain—and"). Zero head-hopping; voice modulates from clinical to lyrical seamlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion: "morphine bubbles against plastic" fuses image and rhythm. Minor repetition of "pulsing stillness" (monitor/beats vs. final realization) risks redundancy but pays off conceptually. No loops; closure image ("lightning bolt frozen mid-flash") avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms hospice cliché via kalimba-as-stethoscope and vinyl shard as philosophical tool. "Hymning the mundane" synthesizes sound/memory into fresh emotional calculus. Risk-taking (lyric compression) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity—closure feels inevitable.</comment>
