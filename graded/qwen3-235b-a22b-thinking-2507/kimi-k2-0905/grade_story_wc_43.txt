<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but Calderon’s "never learned to end things clean" rings therapeutic and unmotivated; his final whisper lacks embodied contradiction under death’s pressure despite strong micro-choices like tracing the vinyl.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "reunify does not mean repair" crystallizes the vinyl shard’s meaning as Mara holds fragments to her sternum, reweighting hope with visceral, inherited grief.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The vinyl shard constrains choices (Mara’s ritual, Calderon’s tracing) and charges the final image; "scent of hope" transforms from memory to actionable sound, making setting an active emotional engine.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mara’s agency: hymning mundane sounds becomes a pressure point that alters Calderon’s breathing, then shifts to scent-as-sound, with the cost of death made legible via the flattened monitor and daughter’s weeping.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: Mara’s sensory transpositions ("lullaby that smelled faintly of petrichor") reflect her music-therapist lens; rhythmic control under pressure in "each beep a small stone dropped into deep water" avoids lyric excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops and high density, but "the chord she’d woven" misuses musical terminology (kalimba plays single notes), causing a lexical illusion that slightly dulls the closure beat’s precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms hospice tropes through "hymning the mundane" and vinyl-as-hope; the fresh synthesis of scent/sound/record shards feels inevitable, though "radiant haven above clouds" risks cliché without the city’s "glowing organism" payoff.</comment>
