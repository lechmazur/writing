<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority leans intellectual over embodied; Torvald's emotional progression lacks contradictory impulses in scene despite rich perception. Daughter's death backstory remains abstract rather than driving micro-choices with visible cost during the key reversal moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves flawless Conceptual Repricing as Torvald dissolves into "the space between memory and possibility," with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds perfectly through density increase in perception shifts, though orientation waiver for "hydraulic clock shepherd" (word 45) feels borderline functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Environment charges the final image (dissolving station), meeting 9+ gate, but micro-setting elements like brass instruments don't constrain choices earlier. Fjord setting remains atmospheric rather than actively shaping tactics during the water-flow reversal crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation through density increase perfectly executes under Accumulative lens: each perception shift (uphill water, horizon dissolution) narrows options while deepening the time-reversal concept. Cost—loss of linear time understanding—is made legible in the dissolution image with crystallized stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete particulars: the key's worn teeth and reversing water become the non-literal answer to time's nature. Final image ("space between memory and possibility") avoids moralizing while reweighting the entire premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful ("razor edges glinting like frozen lightning"), with rhythmic control tightening under pressure. Zero head-hopping; compression of time concepts remains legible. Only hairline slip: slight register drift in "primal rhythm" phrasing amid crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion flawless—sentences vary rhythm to mirror time distortion. One density risk: "watercolor wash of impossible gradients" borders on overwriting but is redeemed by immediate payoff in eye-ache comprehension. Zero loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms time tropes through hydraulic specificity ("water-driven timepieces" storing surrendered moments). Risk-taking (nonlinear time as radiating ripples) heightens stakes without gimmickry; the fjord setting grounds cosmic concepts in tactile reality.</comment>
