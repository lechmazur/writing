<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied action ("overrode instinct to flee") and micro-choices (uncorking vial despite fearing waste). Cost is visceral: empty vial = lost Earth-memory anchor. Minor abstraction in "memories being touched" phrasing prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "lonesome splendor" crystallizes stance with undeniable cost (burning lungs, empty vial). Orientation flawless ("flooded nave" by line 1), accumulative lens holds through density shift from hush to resonance. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Temple actively constrains choices (stone tendrils muffling signal, coral organ requiring pure note). Micro-setting (vial) charges closure: "bubbles shaped like lilac blossoms" transforms stone into memory-carrier. Sensory hierarchy perfectly mirrors urgency—crisis narrows to scent/vibration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via accumulative escalation: "last pocket of air shrank" → "lungs burning." Mira’s agency drives the turn (uncorking vial), with felt cost (sacrificing Earth-memory). Pressure grows through sensory density shift (hush → resonance), reweighting options under chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely from concrete actions: "turned solitude into signal, scent into salvation." Final image ("temple waits, singing softly") reweights loneliness without moralizing. Avoids false equivalence—temple’s silence isn’t "wrong," but Mira’s choice reconfigures its purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes ("snow muffles footsteps" for hush). Rhythm modulates under pressure: staccato phrases during crisis ("Lungs burning"), lyrical flow in resolution. Zero head-hopping; "kelp-thin" laugh shows voice consistency even mid-collapse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold—every sentence advances atmosphere. "Violet star" metaphor avoids cliché through precision. Final line’s "scented, stubborn, and true" uses rhythmic triad purposefully. No figurative muddle even in high-pressure beats like uncorking vial.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: distress signal via perfume vial in underwater temple. Transformation test passed—plot fails with generic "hope token"; lilac’s Earth-memory specificity matters. Risk-taking (scent-as-signal) heightens stakes coherently without gimmickry.</comment>
