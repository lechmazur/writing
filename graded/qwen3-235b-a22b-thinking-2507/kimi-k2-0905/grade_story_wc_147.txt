<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mira’s guilt vs. cartographer’s duty; "knees bruised by pressure and guilt" embodies conflict without labels. Final choice to sacrifice the vial earns closure through prior scent-motivation, though "lonesome splendor" slightly over-articulates the emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands flawlessly: Mira’s endurance becomes signal ("temple kept broadcasting"), with conceptual cost in the "empty crystal vial" offering. Accumulative lens holds throughout—pressure tightens via shrinking air pocket and recoiling hush, culminating in the organ’s transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting (copper coil, lilac vial) charges the final image: "bubbles shaped like lilac blossoms" reweights the vial’s absence. Sensory hierarchy excels—crisis narrows focus to scent/vibration, while murals’ "peeling like wet parchment" grounds decay in tactile urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via "shrinking air pocket" as time pressure, but "as time runs short" remains atmospheric rather than a live clock altering tactics. Escalation is visceral (stone tendrils vs. signal), yet the cost—sacrificing Earth-memory—is felt, not operationalized in survival mechanics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through scent-as-memory: "temple adopted her past as liturgy" reweights the vial’s loss without moralizing. Final image ("perfumed proof that even when time runs short...") delivers non-literal resonance, avoiding thematic echo by embedding hope in stone’s yearning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is immaculate—"distress pulsed through the flooded nave" filters crisis through cartographer’s sensory mapping. Voice modulates from clinical ("lapis tiles") to lyrical ("violet star") under stress, with no head-hopping in this single-POV tour de force.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; "luminous plankton" and "kelp-thin laugh" achieve textural specificity without muddle. Minor deduction: "gathered hush" repetition in climax risks slight density strain, but "coral-grown organ, pipes clogged with silt" maintains propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography and scent-as-signal transforms tropes—mapping resonance replaces coastlines, making "lonesome splendor" emotionally precise. Avoids derivative sci-fi via tactile details: "copper coil tightened," "bruised knees," where world logic serves human fragility.</comment>
