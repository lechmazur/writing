<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in the priest’s swallow tasting "of iron and evening," but the woman’s characterization lacks embodied conflict despite pivotal actions; micro-choices like the palette cross earn endurance yet omit her internal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost—the blood taste replacing iron, possession passing through "newfound clarity"—under a flawless Accumulative lens; the dimensional anchor’s release reconfigures doubt’s weight without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: ultramarine constrains every choice (only one color), charges the final image as "ordinary chip," and evolves from dimension-anchor to symbol of earned clarity; marble nave and dust deepen tactile pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation via the priest’s agency—layering sounds, the infinite reverse swallow—narrowing options to one loop; cost is unmistakable as "doubt diluted" holy water and the blood taste crystallizing renunciation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the blue wall metaphor reweighted by the woman’s line, avoiding moralizing; "faith was a wall, not a door" earns complexity via pigment sinking like "flesh accepts memory," resisting tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in "dust that preferred not to settle" and "vowels sagging like surrender"; consistent focalization avoids head-hopping, though "sounded like surrender" slightly overwrites in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via "cough... caught and released like a bird testing stained glass" does triple duty; minor register drift in "sounded like surrender" avoids closure harm but prevents 9.5.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of loop pedal as spiritual tool transforms religious tropes; risk-taking heightens stakes (sound as dimensional anchor) while the ultramarine’s evolution feels inevitable, avoiding gimmickry through concrete pressure.</comment>
