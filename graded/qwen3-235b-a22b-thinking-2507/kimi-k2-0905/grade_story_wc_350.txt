<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority shines via embodied metaphors ("silence ached like a missing rib"), but Mireya’s "empathetically decisive" trait lacks contradictory impulses in crisis; her flawless execution undercuts genuine struggle despite vivid sensory reactions to mechanical distress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the elevator’s song reconfigures isolation into shared custodianship with tangible cost (Mireya’s exhaustion, dew-turned-prisms), under an Accumulative/Textural lens where language-braiding deepens into cosmic resonance without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The lead pine cone weight constrains choices (mending chain with copper wire/hymn) and charges the final image (swinging "steady, ticking off seconds that no longer belonged to isolation"), transforming a tool into thematic keystone with prismatic dew reflecting closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via Mireya’s language-braiding vigil—pressure tightens as silence "ached like a missing rib" to the elevator’s demand "Build me a bridge"—but the single deepening lacks a visible price paid *during* escalation; cost manifests only at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "bridge is a song you can walk across," with the final wheat-prisms spelling "gratitude in glints" offering non-literal resolution to "silos are islands," avoiding moralizing while charging closure through concrete image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cradling a fallen cuckoo clock weight like a cold heart") and rhythmic control peak in four-language singing; compression taught early ("languages stored in labeled drawers") pays off in seamless multi-POV shifts via speaking tube.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cedar ribs vibrating with the same melody" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor overwriting in "violins made of augers" slightly dilutes momentum, but closure image ("roadway of resonance no silo could contain") avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of astronomical mechanics and choral harmony feels inevitable—"grain elevator groaned, then sang" transforms industrial function into emotional truth—while "bread can remember the music of its becoming" risks cliché but lands through specific wheat/prism imagery.</comment>
