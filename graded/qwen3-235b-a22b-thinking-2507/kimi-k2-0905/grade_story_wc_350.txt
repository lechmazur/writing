<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via embodied mechanics ("wheeze," "hunger as off-key chords"), but "empathetically decisive" remains label-dominant; micro-choices lack contradictory impulses at peak stress (e.g., mending weight feels frictionless).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "boundary between mechanical and human breath would remain porous" crystallizes the reconfiguration. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through language-braiding density shift to "roadway of resonance."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tower’s brass rings and pine-cone weight constrain choices (e.g., wire rehang), charging the final "metallic dust" image. Sensory hierarchy reflects librarian’s choral focus: "chain sang a descending scale," not visual spectacle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through linguistic rehabilitation ("Build me a bridge"), but elevator’s threat lacks escalation cost; pressure intensifies via density (language braiding), yet Mireya’s vigil lacks tangible tradeoffs beyond fatigue.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</comment><comment>Theme emerges through "bridge" motif reweighted as "song you can walk across," avoiding moralizing. Final wheat-taste image ("metronomes and lullabies") delivers non-literal answer to mechanized humanity without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: librarian notices "off-key chords," "copper artery," "lexical dust." Rhythmic control under pressure (e.g., four-part harmony rehang) shows stress-appropriate compression without voice drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; "cedar ribs vibrating" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor density dip in "languages stored in labeled drawers" (slight overwriting), but final image’s "prisms" and "Morse" maintain propulsion without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms clock-tower tropes via choral linguistics; "Lushootseed for river" grounds freshness in verifiable detail. Risk-taking (interspersed languages as rope) heightens stakes coherently, with closure proving "bread can remember music."</comment>
