<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority strong via embodied weaving, but motivation lacks visceral contradiction; composite man's dissolution offers felt cost yet final realization feels intellectually tidy without sufficient struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds flawlessly—density escalates through thread-as-neuron metaphors to Charged Poise closure where "weight of being witnessed" crystallizes cost; orientation clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sinew thread functions as micro-setting charging closure (empty spool = carried texture), but gallery details rarely constrain choices beyond gravity illusions; auroras "tasting like nostalgia" elevates specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake "discover texture of connection" tightens via weaving mechanics, culminating in earned renunciation (creator/creation duality lost); conceptual cost undeniable as composite man dissolves into "dandelion seeds" of relationships.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: final line "weight of being witnessed" reweights sinew thread’s journey without moralizing; avoids sentimentality by grounding connection in tactile thread imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("walls breathed with rhythm of human hearts"); rhythmic control sustains under pressure with patterned elision ("memories alter architecture") taught early and paid at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold, but "rational enchantment" phrasing drifts into abstract diction mid-climax; final line’s "truly seen" charges closure with zero overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms optical illusion trope through sinew thread’s physicality; "realistically imaginary" framing risks abstraction yet earns freshness via gallery-as-neural-network mechanics and bold conceptual closure.</comment>
