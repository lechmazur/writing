<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; motivation remains abstract ("discover texture") without tangible struggle. Epiphany ("she was the thread") feels unearned by micro-choices, with calm overriding emotional stakes. Composite man dissolves without altering her state, violating "flaws complicate choices" requirement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Conceptual Repricing: "weight of being witnessed" reweights connection with conceptual cost. Orientation clear by paragraph 1; Accumulative lens holds as density builds toward resonant ending. Missing persistent constraint shaping tactics prevents 9.0+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gallery functions as micro-setting that constrains action (walking on ceilings) and charges closure ("walls breathing with rhythm of human hearts"). Sinew thread as recurring object directly enables final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>No visible price paid despite thematic weight; "unsettling calm" undermines cost legibility. Stakes remain abstract ("texture of connection") without concrete test or narrowed options. Band guardrail for 8.8+ unmet—no price charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (weaving thread) not statements. Final line "weight of being witnessed" delivers resonant non-literal answer to central question, avoiding moralizing while charging prior material with earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("paintings watched observers with patience of predators") and rhythmic control under pressure ("walls erupting in slow motion"). No head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early and paid off in closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but "sinew thread" repetition edges toward template cadence in high-pressure beats. "Tasted like nostalgia" shows textural specificity, though "emotional temperature" slightly drifts into abstraction without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms dream-logic tropes via "sinew thread from dreams" and "realistically imaginary" framing. Emotional specificity ("dandelion seeds" for dissolving relationships) avoids generic templates, though optical gallery premise risks familiarity without fresh inflection.</comment>
