<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority thrums with embodied contradiction—nervous drumming versus confident decoding—culminating in her earned choice to stay, charged by the copper nail’s physical imprint. Voss’s brother revelation deepens stakes without flattening his opposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands flawlessly: Mara etching coordinates refracts "reversible exile" into active remembrance, with felt cost (prolonged exile) crystallized in the helm-log’s verdigris thumbprint. Causal lens holds from decoded stanza to refracted truth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Weather Station Cirrus-9’s spongey dread isn’t backdrop but pressure—mildew preserves journals, jet stream shifts create the shoal, and glass walls become mapping tools. The copper nail evolves from coffin relic to stylus, charging the final image’s cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Mara’s question forces Voss’s stance crystallization; the cost (proving the journey worth remembering) is unmistakable in the helm-log discovery. Agency drives every escalation under the causal lens, narrowing options toward Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through refracted light and mildew—not moralizing—culminating in the non-literal answer: "rain that now fell with purposeful direction." Final image reweights "exile" as active remembrance without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("perfume of denial," "spongey dread") modulates with pressure; syntax compresses during decoding ("Latitude of forgiveness is colder than calculated"). No head-hopping, with Voss’s dialogue carrying subtext about buried bravery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence multi-tasks ("barometers screamed and experimental kites fought the newborn wind shears"). Final line’s rhythm ("reversible as breath, eternal as weather") achieves crystalline propulsion without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms "reversible exile" from legal term to philosophical engine; the map librarian’s specificity (decoding water damage as semaphore) avoids tropes. Copper nail’s evolution feels inevitable yet fresh, resisting abstraction through lived detail.</comment>
