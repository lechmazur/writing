<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Queen’s embodied urgency (blurring reflection, memory-dripping palms) drives micro-choices; contradiction between fearing erasure yet stepping onto the dais earns closure with visible cost. "Fingering the torn map" crystallizes hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands impeccably: the shared exhale crystallizes options with conceptual cost (erasure/coronation). Orientation anchors by 100 words; Accumulative lens holds through starlight-to-crown transformation, reweighting stakes via memory’s physicality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt grotto’s "frost flowered on eyelashes" constrains choice (temperature inversion = paradox of forgiveness/betrayal), charging the final image where mirrors crack. Micro-setting (obsidian shard reflecting dream-self) directly shapes the queen’s irreversible decision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Accumulative pressure: bleeding starlight evolves from prophecy to memory-loss symptom to sacrificial crown. Agency-driven escalation peaks when queen realizes dreams are future memories, narrowing options to "burn memory or seal fate" with conceptual cost legible in the crown’s "coronation/erasure" weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through charged objects (crown as erasure/coronation) and final image of warming summers "as if a hidden crown burned," reweighting memory’s cost without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by embedding wisdom in fireflies’ "silent applause" guiding new climbers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("dew that never touched earth," "coppery air") filters all details through queen’s eroding identity. Rhythmic control under pressure: short clauses during ascent ("air thinned into lace") contrast lyrical closure ("summer nights grew warmer"), with no head-hopping in single-POV frame.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless density: "molten silver that hissed against the stone" merges sensory, thematic, and causal work. One paraphrase loop ("tasting iron, tasting endings") costs 0.1; no figurative muddle in peak beats. Final line’s "remembering for everyone" avoids sentimentality through concrete image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms time-loop trope via memory-as-bleeding-starlight mechanic; specificity of "basalt steps glowing with residue of fallen constellations" avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (future-self as dream voice) heightens stakes without gimmickry, fulfilling 9+ synthesis test through earned reconfiguration.</comment>
