<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("coronation and erasure") and embodied emotion ("lacy menace wrapped her lungs") compel the queen's irreversible choice. Micro-choices like pressing forward despite blurred reflection deepen motivation. Flaws (denial of prophecy) compound organically without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost: "weight both coronation and erasure" crystallizes the sacrifice. Accumulative lens holds—pressure builds through sensory density ("frost flowered on her eyelashes") not causal turns. Orientation clear by paragraph one; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto’s "lacy menace" constrains choices (thinning air sewing her closer) and charges the final image ("dissolve into simple truth"). Micro-setting details like "molten silver that hissed against the stone" reweight memory loss as physical cost. No generic placeholders—every detail filters through queen’s urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven by queen’s agency: her realization that dreams are future memories ("knot tied by future desperation") narrows options to one irreversible choice. Cost is unmistakable in the crown’s "weight" and "burn[ing] the last of her living memory." Dominant stake (erasure) tightens via sensory deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: bleeding starlight as memory drips, fireflies as "cautious eyes." Final image ("summer nights grew warmer... remembering for everyone") offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality while exploring loss as collective necessity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dew that never touched earth," "coppery air tasting iron") modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control shifts from lyrical ("bleeding starlight pooled in her palms") to staccato ("Trembling, she realized"). Zero head-hopping; psychic distance tightens with the dais approach.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold—sentences like "a paradox that felt like forgiveness wrapped inside betrayal" layer meaning without clutter. High density: "obsidian shard reflecting... the dream itself" compresses backstory and stakes. Final line’s "doomed to forget" crystallizes theme without stating it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specific logic: bleeding starlight as memory, fireflies as "cautious eyes" of renewal. Emotional truth in quiet sacrifice avoids cliché. Risk-taking (non-linear time loop) heightens stakes coherently—closure makes the loop inevitable, not clever.</comment>
