<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara's confession about living rooms, but micro-choices lack earlier contradictory impulses. Her fear of silence motivates the climax credibly, though embodied emotion wavers slightly in abstract moments like "walls between hearts." The endurance of witnessing earns closure through palpable cost: roots extending into stone.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands flawlessly: Mara dissolving into the crystal veins reconfigures "bunker inspector" into "tender of latent radiance" with undeniable conceptual cost. The opaque mirror bearing her imprint crystallizes irreversible transformation under the Accumulative/Textural lens, where density peaks as confessions become light filaments stitching the chamber into a single heart.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The crystal caves function as micro-setting that constrains choices—the mineral tears fracture light to reveal confessions, and calcite blooming directly enables the climax. "Air tasted of salt and iron" grounds sensory urgency, though "rainbows trapped in mid-sob" borders on ornamental. Final image of Mara walking through "crystal veins" charges closure by making the setting the story's new logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulated confessions ("I never told her; I thought there would be more time"), narrowing Mara's path from certification to witnessing. Pressure coheres as the pearl's warmth escalates to dissolution, but external conflict lacks tangible opposition beyond atmospheric weight. The cost—Mara's physical integration with stone ("roots extending from her temples")—forecloses her former life with visceral finality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action, not moralizing: "tending latent radiance" by polishing hopes with the pearl's glow answers the central question of forgiveness without stating it. The final image of reflected "the face it forgot it possessed" reweights prior material as a resonant, non-literal solution, avoiding sentimentality by grounding hope in orphan-carried seashells and "uncried tears."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice carries a distinct perceptual signature—"air tasted of salt and iron, as though the planet itself were bleeding"—with rhythmic control that accelerates during the crown's placement ("copper threads bite gently"). Slight register drift occurs in "calcified into the cave’s growing skin," but compression during high pressure ("the pearl flared, insisting") maintains coherence under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Minor density issues in "mineral tears... fractured it into rainbows trapped in mid-sob" risk overwriting, but propulsion remains strong. A paraphrase loop weakens impact: "walls between hearts could be dissolved" echoes later as "walls between hearts thinned." Final line achieves crystalline clarity ("polishing them... until they reflect back to the world"), though the loop prevents a 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms apocalypse tropes through emotional specificity—bunker inspector as witness, not savior—and synthesizes "latent radiance" with orphan-carried seashells. The fresh inflection lies in confessions calcifying as physical hopes, avoiding abstraction. Risk-taking heightens stakes via the crown's non-ruling purpose, though "heartbeat of a hesitation" edges toward familiar lyricism.</comment>
