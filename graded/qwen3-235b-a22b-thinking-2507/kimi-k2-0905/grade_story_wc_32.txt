<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("stoically sensitive" yet driven by destructive hope) manifests in embodied choices like blood ritual; final sight sacrifice earns renunciation with visible cost. Slight abstraction in "creative destruction was the only gospel" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands flawlessly: "nothing whole stays holy" reweights premise with blindness as undeniable cost. Accumulative lens holds through density shifts ("hiss became hymn" to "scarlet steam"), pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ember nexus constrains every choice (arranging crozier on "hottest vein," blood-pouring precision) and charges closure via "glassy seeds." Twilight’s "iron indigo" deepens to mirror alchemist’s sacrificed sight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize when ash meets frost—"hiss became hymn" tightens options to vivification or failure. Blindness cost alters tactics immediately ("Blind, the alchemist smiled"), driven by agency under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ritual actions, not declaration; final image ("nothing broken stays still") offers resonant answer to "creative destruction" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite high abstraction risk.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frequencies of faith," "penny-drops rhythm") persists under pressure. Rhythmic control shifts from staccato ritual beats to lyrical transformation ("wooden fibers budding into silver leaves").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "through successive approximation" repetition slightly dulls high-pressure beat; otherwise high density ("counting drops like decades" compresses time/emotion/action). Closure lines pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy mythos with "distilled ash of sermons" as fuel; emotional specificity in "ruined ribs" avoids generic templates. Risk-taking (lyric density) heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
