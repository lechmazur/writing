<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority excels via embodied perception ("scorched echoes in his ledger," "heart beating a penny-drops rhythm"), but minor abstraction in "creative destruction was the only gospel he trusted" slightly undermines concrete causality for the final renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: blindness sacrifice crystallizes cost ("cold petals on his lungs"), while the "descending path" reconfigures stakes under Accumulative lens; the penny-drop motif pays off orientation debt with visceral cost in the final line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ember nexus constrains every choice (blood poured into "hottest vein," fissure-sealing), with "frozen bloom" evolving from literal frost to thematic charge in the final image; micro-setting (goggles, pipette) directly shapes the sacrifice and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through alchemist’s agency alone (blood ritual, ash offering), with blindness as undeniable cost; pressure escalates via sensory density ("hiss became hymn," "scarlet steam") under Accumulative lens without requiring multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("frequencies of faith," "scorched echoes"), with rhythm modulating under pressure (short sentences during transformation); no head-hopping, and elision ("through successive approximation") taught early via ledger references pays off in methodology.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "frozen bloom" repetition evolves meaning without muddle, though "cold bloom of data" slightly risks abstraction in high-pressure beat, narrowly avoiding overwriting penalties.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms alchemy tropes via specific stakes (seventh-child destiny) and irreplaceable closure (blindness enabling "new colors"); risks unconventional structure but coherence holds through ember nexus constraint and charged final image.</comment>
