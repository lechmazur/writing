<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (preserve memory vs. release legacy) act simultaneously during drawing; "cracked nails" embodies the cost of rectifying the portrait. No diagnostic label-speak—emotions emerge through tactile actions like charcoal "twitching" as an "inescapable calling."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the open lock releasing laughter reconfigures memory as living sound, with cost in the irreversible transformation of the portrait. The Accumulative lens holds perfectly—the cave’s crystalline response intensifies with each stroke toward this resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The broken lock constrains choices across beats (jammed→warm→snapping open) and charges the final image as "reset to zero." Quartz growth actively shapes tactics—mineral skin encrusts pigment, turning memory into geology that forecloses the path of solitary remembrance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency: her shift from "rectify the ruin" to collaborative drawing narrows options, with visceral cost in "strokes that cracked her nails." Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—the deepening reweights stakes as the cave’s response evolves from passive reflection to active harmony.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Final image (rose light igniting lanterns) reweights "auroral sorrow" into "becoming" without stating morals. Theme emerges through concrete action: "forgiveness is memory learning to breathe underwater" avoids abstraction by tying to the cave’s iron taste and the daughter’s clean tear-tracks.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "walls singing a low chord only exiles can hear"—bias filters the cave’s geology through her artistic grief. Rhythmic control under pressure: short phrases ("heart rattling") during discovery shift to lyrical flow as she draws, with zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "quartz and feldspar" crystallizes specificity while advancing theme. Final line ("charcoal turning to dawn in the mouth of the world") delivers closure with unparalleled density—no figurative muddle, pure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms dementia tropes via geological metaphor: memory literally becomes crystal. Risk-taking (lyric mosaic structure) heightens stakes—the date’s evolution (4-7-9→7-4-9) feels inevitable in hindsight, avoiding sentimental safety.</comment>
