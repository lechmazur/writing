<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (apology as both goal and burden) manifests through embodied micro-choices like breath-tightening the lace; cerulean regret avoids diagnostic labels by anchoring in tactile ritual. Final renunciation of exile-as-pruning earns closure through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis crystallizes when severance reframes as "long pruning," with cost legible in "fertile ground" left by receding tides. Accumulative lens holds through lace-pattern recurrence, pressure tightening via compass revelation without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Antique lace functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—dyed cerulean by salt/sorrow, then tied to wrist as "banner of surrender." Constraints choice (breath-tightening fabric) and reconfigures apology’s meaning through thread-level specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (naming apology’s color) tightens through lace’s hidden map revelation, narrowing options to backward journey through silences. Cost manifests in endurance of severance’s "compact rings," visible when roots "taste the metal" he abandons.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image of "fertile ground" after receding tides offers resonant non-literal answer to memory’s burden, reweighting severance as pruning. Theme emerges from lace’s rose/vacancy pattern, avoiding moralizing through embodied action ("apology is this").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature evident in bonsai-tutor’s rhythmically placid diction ("Grow slower; the tides...") and compression under stress ("words arrived late"). Voice modulates from fog-like syllables to steady "dripping water" instruction without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "compass needle swung, hunting for iron that no longer existed" does triple duty (character, theme, tension). Final line’s "fertile ground" avoids muddle while recharging tide motif with closure cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms bonsai tropes through severance-as-pruning metaphor, with lace’s rose/vacancy pattern synthesizing apology’s rhythm. Risk-taking (compass revealing map in thread) feels inevitable via mother’s "rhythmically placid eye" setup, heightening emotional specificity.</comment>
