<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied through tactile metaphors ("ache colored my nights cerulean regret"); micro-choices in lace ritual reveal hierarchy of values. Kaede's severance backstory slightly under-integrated but doesn't undermine the earned renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: compass stillness + bonsai's teal pulse reconfigures "unspoken apologies" with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds through lace instructions; orientation clear by line 5 with islet/tide anchors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting (bonsai) charges closure: absorbs colored droplet to manifest "the sea's forgiveness." Salt-slick bench constrains ritual posture; rain-dripping pines set cadence for emotional work. Environment actively shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through lace instructions: tracing vine (avoidance), untying knot (regret management), diffusing breath (sorrow transformation). Cost legible in narrator's rib-hollow warming and Kaede's mirrored history. Agency drives every deepening beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through bonsai pruning as apology metaphor; final image ("pruning is also a form of apology") resonates without moralizing. "Teal" reweights premise as conceptual cost—no tidy resolution, only carried understanding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tide hissed," "rain dripped in slow piano notes") modulates with ritual intensity. Kaede's sparse dialogue ("Trace the outward vine") contrasts narrator's lyrical interiority without convergence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where every line advances atmosphere/meaning ("compass shivered, glass clouded with mother's silhouette"). Figurative language ("voice slow as sap") serves Accumulative lens without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bonsai, maritime, and apology tropes through concrete "teal" color concept. Risk-taking with Accumulative structure pays off via tactile ritual, though severance backstory slightly generic.</comment>
