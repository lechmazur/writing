<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("gift or accusation" button) and embodied emotion ("narrow vastness... quiver") drive micro-choices under pressure; final breath relief earned through ritual's physicality without epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("breath move without pain"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density of seeds/birds, with jetty's transformation crystallizing the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Jetty planks with bullet holes constrain action (seeds scattered through holes), while seed pods charge the final image (shoot breaking splinters); sensory details like "coral dust that had once been alive" serve urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via "tide turning" urgency and the terns' warning; the deepening occurs when he "felt the submerged concord accepted the truce," making cost legible in his physical relief at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "vegetation could metabolize gunpowder," avoiding moralizing; the shoot breaking splinters offers resonant non-literal answer to whether growth follows death, with bees pronouncing names embodying earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("spoke dead languages the way fishermen speak storms") and rhythmic control under pressure; elision of backstory taught early through "every dusk since cease-fire" without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("seeds sank, weighted by memory") with purposeful figurative language that never obscures cause/effect, even in peak beats like the phosphorescent reef vision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ecological grief ritual where "narrow vastness" concept transforms tropes; risks accumulative structure but heightens stakes through botanical specificity ("helical seeds like propellers") without gimmickry.</comment>
