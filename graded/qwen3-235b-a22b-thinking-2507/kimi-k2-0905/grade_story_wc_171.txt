<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak but "beauty flawed by responsibility" edges toward summary; micro-choices like mustering the dead reveal value hierarchy with cost. Contradictory impulses (duty vs exhaustion) act simultaneously in the signing beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with conceptual cost: "redemption's price was paid not in a single [moment]" crystallizes endurance's weight. Accumulative lens holds as ritual density reweights stakes; celestial dance resuming slower proves time's exhaustion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ebony clipboard functions as micro-setting—its warming surface during name-recitation charges the final image. Terrace stones bearing "three thousand years" constrain choices by making compromise inevitable; midsummer twilight pressures the ritual's timing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through ritual deepening: mustering the dead transforms from secret to collective act, narrowing options to flawed peace. Cost is legible in "seventeen failures transformed into one fragile hope"—tangible shift from burden to active tending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "garden growing in hostile soil" reweights redemption without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite "flawed beauty" repetition; cost of imperfect peace crystallizes in the scarred clipboard's final transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("operatively gentle curves," "flawed beauty of a ceremony") filters all description. Voice modulates under pressure—trembling hands to steady signing—but "beauty flawed by responsibility" slightly breaks POV specificity in reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor overwriting ("ritual significance etched deeper," "flawed beauty of a ceremony") creates slight density drag. No closure artifacts; "warm in her hands" avoids purple prose by charging the ending image with tactile cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "forever war" trope through ritual specificity—mustered names as witnesses feels inevitable. Risk-taking (Accumulative lens for war narrative) heightens stakes; "garden in hostile soil" avoids middle-ground hedging with visceral freshness.</comment>
