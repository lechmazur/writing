<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via blood-written names and trembling hands, but "operatively gentle" feels diagnostic rather than embodied. Micro-choice of speaking names reveals value hierarchy with visible cost, though minor label slips prevent 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: distributed burden becoming shared strength crystallizes peace as practice with undeniable conceptual cost ("not conquered but carried"). Orientation anchors by line 3, lens (Accumulative) holds through terrace's transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Terrace actively constrains choices—obsidian drinking starlight to reflect war, silver veins pulsing with heartbeat—culminating in purposeful crumbling. Final image charged by soil-matching blood, though "no-man’s-land lily" slightly ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via ritual pressure: offerings trigger terrace’s response, names become chorus, enemies climb as mourners. Cost is unmistakable in "shared burden" becoming strength, though dominant stake ("remembering rightly") signaled late at midpoint.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "peace was not a destination but a practice" crystallized through cairn-building. Final line’s "daily price" reweights redemption without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through concrete action (gardener of memory).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("rust-brown matching soil," "flawed beauty of peace") with rhythmic control. Minor register drift in "operatively gentle" disrupts POV modesty; otherwise clean focalization under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dried to rust-brown matching soil" exemplifies high-density propulsion. One hairline slip: "forever war peace negotiator" has slight syntactic monotony but no closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms war memorial tropes via terrace mechanics—clipboard to cradle to light-shards. Risk-taking in "flawed beauty" avoids safety middle, synthesizing memory/peace through specific, inevitable details (blood-ink lilies).</comment>
