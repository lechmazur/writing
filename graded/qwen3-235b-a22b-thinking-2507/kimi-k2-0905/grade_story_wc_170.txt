<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction emerges late; "elusive" trait isn't tested until climax when she steps into the glow, but embodied emotion in heartbeat sync lacks earlier micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: mirrors shift to "infinite attempts" with conceptual cost of borrowed heartbeat becoming shared, but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural dominant) slightly weakens causal escalation at midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prism parapet constrains every choice—raindrops refract reality, acoustics enable lullabies, terrace becomes resonating chamber—charging the final image where water spheres show her transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when mirrors show "infinite failures," forcing her to confront self-change, but the cost of transformation (abandoning "elusive" identity) feels slightly under-embodied during the dance climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "mirages could become real if enough people believed" crystallizes in her shift from painting illusions to reflecting possibilities, avoiding moralizing while reweighting the premise via the heartbeat's journey.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("droplets clung like tiny lenses") and rhythmic control peak during the song's cadence shift, though "perceptively calm" trait borders on label without earlier embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density ("coded lullabies in children’s songs" integrates mechanics early), but "perceptively calm" risks label-speak; figurative language remains precise even during high-pressure singing beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "mirage painter" trope through heartbeat mechanics and lullaby physics feels inevitable, though "borrowed heartbeat" concept echoes familiar magical realism without full transformation.</comment>
