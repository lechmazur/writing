<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Protagonist's surrender-to-constraint motivation is concrete and intensifies through embodied memory sacrifices; "becoming transparent to herself" crystallizes contradictory impulses without diagnostic labels. Final renunciation as the constraint itself earns closure with visceral cost (frostbitten fingertip, dissolved identity).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly: density escalates via sensory compression ("frozen tears" wind chimes) culminating in Conceptual Repricing closure. Cost is unmistakable—"each stroke cost her a memory" anchors the dissolution into the lake's wisdom. Orientation achieved by word 15 with spire/ice/frostbite anchors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Obsidian spire and frozen lake actively constrain choices (perfect ice as "last unwritten future"); kingfisher quill functions as micro-setting charging closure via dissolution into tattoo. "Frost flowers blooming from hairline cracks" exemplifies setting-driven action, though "potential constellations" slightly dilutes tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("only one future before dawn") tightens through protagonist's agency: quill's escalating consumption (warmth→weight→heartbeat) narrows options visibly. Cost crystallizes in "stepped off... becoming the blank page," with constraint-as-gift reframing stakes. Minor abstraction in "equations curing diseases" slightly softens visceral impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "maps folded into paper boats sailing backward" embodies ignorance-as-wisdom without moralizing. Final line reweights everything as "space where futures grow," avoiding stated morals while charging the hairline crack. No thematic echo; complexity in "dangerous certainties embedded in ice" lingers ambiguously.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: cartographer's professional lens filters "spire's shadow across the ice" with tactile precision. Rhythmic compression during memory loss ("first... then... finally") heightens pressure without head-hopping. "Groundedly imaginative" phrase momentarily disrupts otherwise flawless voice modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "wind chimes made of frozen tears" achieves triple duty (sound/image/theme). Final line's conceptual density ("remembered everything by forgetting nothing") crystallizes without muddle. Only "children skating on equations" slightly jars the visceral rhythm in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via specific synthesis: ignorance as deliberate vacuum, constraints as innovation catalysts. Emotional truth in "surrendering to the blank page" avoids genericity. Risk-taking (Conceptual Repricing closure) heightens stakes coherently; "frost feathers on a window that hasn't yet been built" epitomizes fresh inflection.</comment>
