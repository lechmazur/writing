<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied ("skin whitening with frostbite") and micro-choices reveal hierarchy (sacrificing memories for the door), but contradictory impulses lack simultaneous tension; motivation clear though backstory remains archetypal rather than character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as perfect Conceptual Repricing: "stepped off... not falling but folding" crystallizes Earned Stasis with undeniable cost (erased memories, dissolving quill), while the hairline question-mark crack reweights the premise under a consistent Accumulative/Textural lens taught by the spire's hum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Obsidian spire and frozen lake actively constrain choices (spiral staircase absorbing reflections, dawn cracking ice), while the kingfisher feather's physicality charges the climax; environment directly shapes the final image's "hairline crack shaped like a question mark" with zero ornamental description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: "only one future before dawn" tightens pressure until the memory-costing door-writing, but stakes slightly abstract ("last unwritten future") lacks visceral immediacy despite flawless conceptual cost legibility in the dissolution sequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete action ("maps folded into paper boats sailing backward"), avoiding moralizing; final line "space where futures grow" delivers resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without stating a moral, reweighting all prior frost metaphors with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("breath crystallizing in pre-dawn air") and rhythmic control shine in high-pressure beats; purposeful compression ("three seasons she had tracked") taught early pays off in closure, with zero head-hopping despite profound interiority under extreme stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion ("touched quill to blueing fingertip") but minor scaffold in "predictive modeling" repetition and "groundedly imaginative" register drift slightly dull momentum in one mid-beat; no closure artifacts yet insufficient for 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms cartographer trope through "ignorance as deliberate clearing," with backward-sailing paper boats offering fresh inflection; emotional specificity ("taste of summer peaches" loss) avoids abstraction, while risk-taking (becoming the constraint) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
