<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Calyx’s hesitation between duty and self, embodied by the seed’s coppery sting and hollowing memory loss. Micro-choices under pressure—biting the seed, planting it with laughter—reveal her hierarchy of values. Minor deduction: Aya function primarily as atmospheric chorus rather than deepening conflict through distinct interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "mind hollow where a mentor’s name had been" crystallizes the trade-off while reconfiguring memory’s survival through doubt. Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly as sensory density tightens toward the fissure’s mending. Thunder’s interruption escalates pressure organically without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choices: liquefying paths force urgency, orchid fibers become literal repair tools, and monsoon mist mirrors evaporating memory. "Basalt" and "vanilla lattice" charge the final image where "petals and stones knit together." Micro-setting (knowledge seed’s ink) embodies cost, satisfying the 9+ gate through tangible stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Calyx’s agency: thunder’s rumble narrows options, forcing the seed-planting choice that sacrifices her teacher’s name. Cost is unmistakable in the hollowed memory and "hands already guiding Aya children," reweighting stakes through action. Dominant stake (ridge erosion vs. cultural memory) tightens coherently under Accumulative pressure without false reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><grade>9.3</grade>The ending’s non-literal answer—"cultural memory survives not because it is true but because people keep agreeing to guard it while knowing they might be wrong"—emerges from Calyx’s sacrifice, not moralizing. "Luminous doubt" evolves from greeting to solution, avoiding thematic echo by charging the ridge’s survival through braided orchids and unanswered questions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("empirically whimsical hush," "tasted of orchids and iron") reflects Calyx’s reality-checking lens. Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure: fragmented clauses during the dream-walk contrast with lyrical closure. Zero head-hopping; communal dream remains focalized through her embodied experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion through concrete verbs ("shuddered," "knitting," "battered"). Figurative language serves momentum: "dragon’s back" scales deepen setting’s pressure without muddle. Minor deduction: "luminous doubt" borders on thematic label but earns weight through final action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via specific logic: "reality checker" requires memory sacrifice, "collective memory" survives through doubt not blind belief. Bold risk in conceptual solution (weaving fissure with questions) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable—"empirically whimsical" ridge held by refusing to decide which half matters.</comment>
