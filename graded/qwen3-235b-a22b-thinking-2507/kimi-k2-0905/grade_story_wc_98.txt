<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in Calyx’s hesitation (duty vs. self) earns her final choice; embodied cost of lost teacher’s name resonates through coppery ink taste. Secondary Aya lack micro-choices under pressure, slightly flattening collective stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Calyx’s hollowed memory forecloses her identity path while guiding children, with cost legible in "mind hollow where a mentor’s name had been." Orientation anchors by line 3; lens (Accumulative/Textural) held through patterned erosion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Setting constrains every choice—the ridge’s fissure demands orchid braiding, monsoon deadline tightens tactics, and "knowledge fruit seed" as micro-setting charges the final image. Sensory specificity ("tasted of orchids and iron") avoids symbolism by driving action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Calyx’s agency: thunder interrupts hesitation, forcing the seed trade. Cost (lost name) alters tactics (she guides children without mentorship), but internal conflict lacks physical manifestation at peak pressure, slightly muting escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action—"weave the vacant gap with doubt" reweights memory’s fragility without moralizing. Final line ("collective refusal to decide which half mattered more") offers resonant, non-literal answer to erosion vs. belief, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("empirically whimsical hush," "breathing the same rhythm as the island"), but "luminous doubt" repetition in Aya’s smiles and Calyx’s smile creates scaffold. Voice modulates under stress with purposeful compression in dream sequences.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with varied syntax, but adjacent repetition of "luminous doubt" (Aya’s smiles → Calyx’s smile) triggers minor scaffold. Figurative language avoids muddle even in peak beats, preserving closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms memory trope via "knowledge fruit seed" mechanics and solution ("weave with doubt"). Risk-taking (lyric mosaic structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity ("vanilla tendrils," "coppery ink") avoids genericity. Slightly familiar premise caps at 9.4.</comment>
