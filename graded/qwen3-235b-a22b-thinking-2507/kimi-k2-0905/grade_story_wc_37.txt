<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "scattered" vs. coherent keeper arc; embodied emotion ("phosphor stung like remembered joy") avoids cliché. Micro-choices under pressure (slamming mica to chest) earn final name-reclamation. Slight abstraction in motivation edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds perfectly: density spikes when "night coagulated into tarry vines," deepening via blood-mica lens. Charged Poise closure lands with undeniable cost—"shards in ribs" fusing with flesh. Orientation clear by 100 words; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting constrains choice: mica window's fracture directly enables blood-lens revelation. Final image ("hum of mica dust fused with flesh") charges the closure with tactile specificity. "Quicksilver dreams" soil evolves causally when glitter sprouts trees.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by keeper's agency: altering lullaby to "invitation" forces night's resistance (tarry vines). Cost unmistakable—"memories bled out as silver dust" during climax. Single tightening (chorus failure → community solidarity) suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "realm dying because mirrors refused to reflect light" crystallizes in final swaddle. No moralizing; "breathe in chorus" reweights dawn motif without stating morals. Epiphany earned via mica-blood lens revelation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "phosphor stung like remembered joy" filters reality through keeper's fragmented psyche. Rhythm modulates under pressure—short, jagged sentences during vine attack. Zero head-hopping; voice remains embodied ("voice cracked yet stubborn").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "clockwork seeds ticking backward" does triple duty (image, sound, stakes). Final line ("exhaling dawns no night could smother") achieves propulsion without overwriting. Minor density risk in "threads of rose and copper braided" saved by payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms "mirror world" trope via alchemical specificity (pomegranates chiming, roots in quicksilver). Risk-taking (abstract conflict) heightens stakes—"bound release" tone makes pain/portal synthesis inevitable. No derivative echoes.</comment>
