<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in sensory specifics (coriander lullaby, phosphor sting) with credible contradiction—stubborn singing amid faltering voice. Final name-shout feels abrupt but earns coherence through blood-cost. Micro-choices under pressure (exhaling note, altering song) lack layered irrationality at peak climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: woven dawns erupting with real sunlight carries undeniable conceptual cost (blood-mica lens, tarry vines smoking). Accumulative escalation flawless—night’s resistance tightens stakes through tangible pressure (spider-webbed mica, memory bleeding). Orientation clear by line 3; lens (textural) held rigorously to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard constrains every choice: quicksilver dreams enable new trees, mica window’s fragility shapes tactics. Sensory hierarchy masterful (starlight on silvery flakes, phosphor’s sting) filtered through keeper’s urgency. Final image—mica dust sprouting ordinary trees—charges closure with embodied specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes (songs as dawn’s loom) tighten decisively when night coagulates into tarry vines attacking the mica. Keeper’s agency drives escalation—altering lullaby into invitation forecloses solo singing with visceral cost (shards in ribs). Cost unmistakable: blood becomes new lens, memories bleed as silver dust.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "songs that knits communities together" reweights at closure as children learning songs. Final image (breathing in chorus) offers non-literal answer to communal healing without moralizing. Avoids false balance—night as collective amnesia has no redemption.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystalline ("phosphor stung like remembered joy," "tarry vines whipped toward voice"). Rhythm modulates under pressure—cracked voice to "bell-vibrating" chorus. Minor thematic echo ("knits communities together") avoided final paragraph; voice remains keeper-specific throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; lines do triple duty ("clockwork seeds ticking backward" conveys decay, sound, time). One hairline slip: "infinite overlapping versions" slightly dilutes climax pressure but serves conceptual repricing. Metaphors stay coherent (woven dawns, audible light) without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: alchemy + memory-keeping transforms tropes (pomegranate fruits chiming, roots in quicksilver dreams). Emotional specificity (grandmother’s coriander) avoids templates. Risk-taking heightens stakes—mirror-world logic fully committed without gimmickry.</comment>
