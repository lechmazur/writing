<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo's embodied phobia ("knees knocking," "trembling take") and contradictory impulses (fleeing shadows yet leaping buildings) drive pivotal choices. Child character lacks depth but enables decryption beat; "vulnerability as punch line" avoids therapy-speak by anchoring in industry context.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: raw footage projection crystallizes stance with visible cost (guards' disgust). Causal lens holds via DNA test → shell discovery → projection; "betray the frame" instruction creates meaningful tightening. Constellation-skylight detail charges final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rusted library functions as active constraint: iron shelves limit movement, skylight constellations become projection surface. "Tears blurred rust into galaxies" recharges setting for closure. Micro-setting (projector gears) directly shapes Leo's outwitting tactic under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving vulnerability is power) tightens through Leo's agency: decryption → shell retrieval → projection. Cost is unmistakable in guards' hesitation and "stride firmly adaptive." "Shell... betray the frame" creates earned reversal narrowing options to one decisive act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (projection of raw footage), not abstraction. Final image—"lights that would never drown the shake"—reweights vulnerability as power without moralizing. Slight thematic echo in "vulnerability isn’t armor; it’s the power source" risks overstatement but stays action-anchored.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: industry jargon ("color-grade into heroism," "stunt beats") filters sensory detail. Rhythmic control under pressure ("three… two… one—") modulates with emotional intensity. Child's dialogue ("listen scared") shows voice distinction without convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("DNA test slid across my trailer’s Formica table"). "Polished gels" metaphor for eyes avoids cliché. Sentence rhythm accelerates during security confrontation ("didn’t run; I placed..."). Closure image ("stars spilled through holes like unpaid extras") crystallizes theme without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "betray the frame" transforms industry jargon into thematic core. Stunt-double lens makes vulnerability visceral (shaking hands on projector gears). Avoids safety-middle by committing to raw footage as resolution, though "power source" metaphor borders on familiar. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
