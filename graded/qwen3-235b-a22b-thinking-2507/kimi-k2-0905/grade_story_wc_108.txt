<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "flinched at his own shadow yet leapt off buildings," but birth-mother’s whisper edges toward thematic echo in final beat, slightly softening earned vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise via projector stunt: guards’ hesitation crystallizes cost (career sacrifice), shell’s wisdom internalized, and rust-blurred stars reconfigure vulnerability as power without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rusted library actively constrains choices—starlight deciphers cast, iron shelves muffle sound, film cans become projection surface—culminating in buckled ceiling as charged final image reflecting raw footage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when shell’s "keep the trembling take" directive transforms fear into agency; security’s arrival forces immediate choice with visible cost (career) as he leaks footage, narrowing options decisively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (shuddering knees, uncut reel), but "vulnerability isn’t armor; it’s the power source" edges toward stated moral, slightly undermining earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: "knees knocking," "camera-smoke taste," and "constellations clogged skylight" filter all detail through stuntman’s embodied dread and professional lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "neon signatures" and "polished gels" exemplify textural specificity. Minor register drift in "transformative betrayal" (industry jargon mid-crisis) barely nicks propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stuntman phobia + filmic vulnerability avoids tropes; "winged lion sticker" reprise in final stride transforms Leo’s birth-sign into earned resilience without gimmickry.</comment>
