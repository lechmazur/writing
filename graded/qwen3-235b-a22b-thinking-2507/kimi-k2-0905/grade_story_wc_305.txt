<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority suffers from sudden memory flood lacking concrete present anchor; "cycle of rebirth" diagnostic label-speak in high-stakes moment violates BRR policy and triggers -0.5 deduction. Contradictory impulses (escape vs. duty) are embodied well in "knees scallop inward" but child's death backstory lacks prior micro-choices to tilt present stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation Test fails: "umbral grotto" setting not anchored until 142 words in, with no functional disorientation payoff. Closure as Charged Poise succeeds (valley exhalation with conceptual cost), but "rebirth demands a death" law assertion feels tacked-on rather than organically escalated under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: hairpin's sap constrains choice (anchoring boy) and charges final image (coins softening to soil). "Vineyard hush" and tannin smells create sensory specificity, though grotto geography remains vague without affecting tactics beyond the sap moment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when wind shears path, but boy's dissipation relies on coincidence rather than protagonist agency. Cost is conceptual (sealing lifeline) but "fermented forgiveness" sap resolution feels convenient; escalation lacks meaningful trade-off as caretaker simply stabs hairpin with no foreclosed option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through hairpin's transformation from heirloom to heart relic, but final line ("everyone has finally come home") veers into sentimental moralizing, triggering -0.6 penalty for thematic echo in closing paragraph that replaces scene pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines: "grape-cooled air," "scallop inward" knees, and tannin smells reflect caretaker's vineyard roots. Rhythmic control under pressure excels (short clauses during dissipation), though "kindly decisive" repetition slightly weakens trait specificity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor density issue: "scallop" verb overuse risks tic (knees/furrow/moth-dust) in high-pressure beats, but intentional pattern taught early. Final image ("lantern left on in a house") avoids purple prose, though "unpaid sorrow turn to wine" borders on mixed metaphor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Scallop" motif transforms rebirth trope through specific physicality (shell, movement, wind), avoiding generic cycles. Risk-taking heightens stakes (boy as "next you"), but vineyard setting leans on pastoral clichés without sufficient subversion for 9+ band.</comment>
