<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices: "prudently daring" manifests as ignoring knee pain to uncover slate while scarred nerves feel nothing. Final transmission choice earns closure via prior causality (Sera’s pillbox lessons), with visible cost in crushed portrait and bandaged knee.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: snowdrop’s "white flag" reweights "unused courage" from abstract code to embodied hope, charged by crushing the pillbox. Accumulative lens holds—pressure tightens through snow-scraping and transmission—while cost (self-destruction via confession) is legible in "bleeding knee" and "silver dust."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zephyr Bluff’s snow constrains choice (boot-heel codes erased by thaw) and charges closure via snowdrop blooming through slate. "Tasted iron from the sea" slightly strains plausibility but environment’s physical logic (wind-turbine power, frostbitten briars) otherwise pressures tactics consistently.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through agency: protagonist’s choice to transmit (not flee) narrows options to redemption or death. Cost crystallizes in "confession that would destroy him," but "tilted-spring air" softens consequence slightly, muting the felt price at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through snowdrop’s reprise: "spies are gardeners" becomes action (crushing pillbox to plant new courage), avoiding moralizing. Final image ("signal... toward the tilted light") resonates as non-literal answer to "where unused courage waits" without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "scarred nerves feel nothing" and "silver hush" reflect spy’s sensory degradation under stress. Rhythmic control peaks in transmission sequence—"console sparked, antenna groaned"—with no head-hopping despite reflective fragments anchored to pillbox cues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "zephyr curling around the cliff" demonstrates rhythmic propulsion. Minor deduction for "thawing thumb" (numb scar tissue wouldn’t feel thawing), but figurative language ("dying star flinging atoms") deepens pressure without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms spy tropes through "gardeners of possible futures" metaphor and snowdrop’s quiet courage. Specificity shines in pillbox micro-code mechanics, but "white flag" risks symbolic convenience without the story’s earned physicality (snowdrop blooming through slate).</comment>
