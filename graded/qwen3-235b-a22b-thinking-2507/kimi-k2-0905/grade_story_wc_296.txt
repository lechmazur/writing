<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("I loved the enemy") manifests physically through seed-biting and rib-unlocking; embodied guilt avoids therapy-speak as vines "holding her like a comrade" charge the confession's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "half-bound by the plant that chose not to devour" crystallizes her penitence while the rewinding vortex reweights her journey from escape to restitution under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The flesh-eating seed constrains choice (wrist-biting for passage) and charges the final image as "growing, ring by ring, into the timber of tomorrow’s storms," making environment inseparable from thematic consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Briar’s agency: her confession ("I let them die") narrows options by forcing acceptance of moral cost, with the seed’s truth-recognition providing visible escalation that reweights the dominant stake of stolen peace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the lake’s transformation: "confession... growing into the timber of tomorrow’s storms" reweights the central question of guilt without moralizing, embracing complexity through sap-rings as living memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("apples frozen mid-rot bobbed like skulls") persists under pressure; rhythmic control modulates with emotional intensity as confession shifts from "knelt like a penitent soldier" to rewinding gyres.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats; "vines wrapping her arm but stopping at the elbow" achieves high density by merging physical action, emotional revelation, and thematic resonance without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of war imagery with botanical serenity ("trunks creaking like old siege towers") feels inevitable, though druid tropes slightly temper risk-taking; specificity in "soldier’s tongue still trying to form the name" elevates beyond archetype.</comment>
