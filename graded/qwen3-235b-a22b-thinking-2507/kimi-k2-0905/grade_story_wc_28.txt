<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction manifests physically in Asha’s hands reading history while mind replays the mother’s "guilty relief," avoiding therapy-speak; her final renunciation of self-righteousness earns empathy’s armor through embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the completed tesserae circle crystallizes options with conceptual cost ("arms of steel that could hold both the saved and the lost"), fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens with persistent constraint (forty-nine tesserae = fire’s duration).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting (tesserae) charges closure: each placed fragment constrains Asha’s choices while the cracked stepping stone’s transformation into "outstretched arms" mirrors her thematic reconfiguration of mercy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Asha’s agency: gathering forty-nine tesserae narrows options to release specific memories, with visible cost in abandoning her past identity ("her own self-righteous speeches") under Accumulative escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Final image of infinite-armed figure offers resonant answer to "what mercy existed in choosing who deserved to remember?" without moralizing, reweighting memory as both burden and blessing through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in tactile astronomy ("fingers reading history in shattered glass") and rhythmic control during mosaic work; zero head-hopping despite deep reflection, with lexicon anchored to archivist’s precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; "forty-nine pieces—the number of days between the fire’s start and the rain" exemplifies high-density propulsion, though "aberrant mercy" risks label-speak but is redeemed by embodied mother/child scene within 3 lines.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Transforms "forgiveness" trope through specific, non-obvious synthesis: mercy as active forgetting via mosaic tesserae, with risk-taking (lyric structure) heightening stakes while closure remains legible.</comment>
