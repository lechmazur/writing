<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (past idealism vs present pragmatism) embodied through tactile choices: gathering tesserae while releasing memories shows values hierarchy with visible cost. "Aberrant mercy" transformation earned by the mother/book image without diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: Asha's departure and lifelong teaching foreclose isolation. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through tesserae accumulation; 49-piece count creates pattern that reweights mercy. Orientation clear within 30 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Minaret and stepping stone function as micro-setting that constrains choice: tesserae gathering mechanics dictate her ritual. Final image charged by environment ("broken sky," starlight work), satisfying 9+ gate. Sensory detail filtered through archivist's tactile expertise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("what mercy existed in choosing who deserved to remember?") escalates through Asha's realization about "aberrant mercy." Final map-building forecloses her isolation with visible cost: abandoning the plaza for years of teaching. Agency drives deepening under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the map of forgetting reweights mercy without moralizing. Final image ("infinite arms holding different objects") offers resonant answer to central question. Avoids false binaries by showing knowledge as both "burden and blessing."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "retrocognitively trapped," "chipped patterns," "tesserae" reflect archivist's lexicon. Rhythmic control under pressure ("Working by starlight...") modulates with emotional intensity. Zero head-hopping; compression taught early through memory cycles.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; high density ("each tiny cube a fragment of astronomical charts" does triple duty). Sentence rhythm varies naturally ("She moved methodically..."). No figurative muddle in peak beats; closure image crystallizes with clean propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Map of forgetting" synthesizes common tropes through specific, grounded choices (49 tesserae = days to rain). Transformation test passed: plot fails if names/places changed. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional truth avoids templates.</comment>
