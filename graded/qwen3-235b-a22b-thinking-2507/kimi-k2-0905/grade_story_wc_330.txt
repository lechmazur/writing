<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in occupation ("memory of gears," "swallowed words") avoids abstraction; contradictory impulses (disbelief vs. seeking) manifest physically in throat ache and silent singing. Final choice earned through embodied micro-choices like kneeling on water.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("throat ached with a lifetime of swallowed words") under Accumulative lens. Single tightening via oasis discovery transforms silence from void to musical staff, reconfiguring stakes through the carpenter's singing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Abandoned train actively constrains choices: shattered mirrors force wrong turns, concave floor becomes musical staff. Micro-setting (rainwater pool) charges closure as "sheet of music only the heart could read," directly shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silence as possibility) tightens through carpenter's agency: disbelief → physical interaction → singing with memory. Escalation via sensory deepening (wind bells to marrow-heard neighs) makes cost undeniable in the throat ache.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "silence is not absence but an unopened mouth" proven by carpenter's singing-with-memory. Final image of rails shimmering with notes answers central question without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines via occupational lens ("rasp of sandpaper," "brass pole warming"), but "wind bells ceased" slightly echoes cliché. Voice modulates perfectly under pressure: lyrical density thins to "he sang, not with mouth, but with memory" at climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats, but paraphrase loop: "time itself seemed to pause" then "misting hush thickened, muffling... into lullaby of almost" repeats temporal stasis concept. High density otherwise; "silver dust settling onto the pool" crystallizes theme.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms circus tropes through specific verisimilitude (carousel carpenter's "swallowed words"). Risk-taking lyric structure pays off: "wrong turn" evolves from error to intentional choice, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
