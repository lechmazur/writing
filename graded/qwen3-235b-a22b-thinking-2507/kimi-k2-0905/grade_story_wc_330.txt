<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("believed none of it, yet need drove him") manifests in physical choices like wrong turns. Micro-choices reveal hierarchy: he prioritizes memory-sound over tools, with embodied cost in throat ache during singing. Final endurance (walking without looking back) forecloses silence with visible cost in swallowed words now sung.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when singing reconfigures silence into "unopened mouth" with felt cost (lifetime of swallowed words). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases via sensory shifts (misting hush thickening, wind bells ceasing), reweighting silence as possibility. Cost proof: "throat ached with lifetime of swallowed words" crystallizes before singing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Abandoned train actively constrains choices (wrong turns in mirror corridor, water pool dictating kneeling). The pool functions as micro-setting that charges closure: rails "shimmering with notes" extend its water-mirror image. Recurring object (wind bells) charges final image via "wind bell chiming inside chime of wind bells," making environment indispensable to thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under Accumulative lens: dominant stake (interpreting silence) tightens via sensory deprivation (misting hush thickening) and deepens when halo reveals "melodies nested in silence." Cost is unmistakable—"throat ached with swallowed words"—but escalation lacks one visible price altering tactics (e.g., physical exhaustion from kneeling).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "silence is not absence but an unopened mouth" crystallizes via singing with memory, not declaration. Final image (rails as musical staff) offers non-literal answer to central question, reweighting silence as possibility without moralizing. Avoids all anti-patterns—epiphany earned through carpenter’s embodied actions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: carpenter notices wood grain ("scenting ghost of sanding hands") over people. Rhythmic control under pressure via fragmented syntax ("instead, the water only kissed his soles") during climax. Minor register drift in "resonant reconfiguration" near end, but voice remains consistent with occupational lexicon ("concave floor," "brass pole").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops in peak beats, but two template cadences ("he carried no tools, only...", "his boots soundless...") in opening. High density achieved via multi-jobbing lines ("vines threading down like green notes on a staff of starlight" fuses setting, metaphor, and theme). Final line avoids overwriting while charging closure ("full, round, and singing").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms circus tropes through carpenter’s sensory POV: trapeze artist’s "song that never left her lungs" reweights silence as generative. Risk-taking (lyric structure, no dialogue) heightens stakes without gimmickry—the water pool’s reflection mechanics directly enable closure. Emotional specificity ("first kiss on cherry wood of mane") avoids generic templates.</comment>
