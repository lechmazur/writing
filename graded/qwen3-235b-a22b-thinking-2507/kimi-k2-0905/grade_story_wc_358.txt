<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Limited interior contradiction despite strong embodied action; Mara's singular focus lacks contradictory impulses under pressure. The patch's dissolution provides visible cost, but emotional stakes remain professional rather than deeply personal, missing the 9+ requirement for simultaneous conflicting drives.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the port's "rehearsing the next silence" crystallizes options with conceptual cost (patch dissolution, glowing fractures). Accumulative lens holds consistently through wind-pattern density, with no orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Shipping containers function as micro-setting that actively constrains choice (Mara treating the maze as a "wind instrument"). The fused-glass circle charges closure by humming underfoot and scorching Mara's reversed writing, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by Mara's agency: her wind-vector survey narrows options to writing backward, with unmistakable cost in the patch's dissolution and "borrowed time" motif. Pressure intensifies through Accumulative density shifts toward the convergence point.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "wind remembers" without moralizing; the final image of Mara "carrying its forecast in her mouth" offers resonant, non-literal answer to foresight's cost. Avoids thematic echo despite bulletin board note.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in technical precision ("wind vector 190 degrees") and stress-modulated rhythm. Zero head-hopping; elision of off-scene events taught early via "forty-eight hours earlier" and paid off in predictive echo.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts: "fossilized lung exhaling last air" achieves high density without muddle, and paragraph cuts accelerate momentum. Final line's "boots printing reverse silhouettes" demonstrates rhythmic control that charges closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of disaster investigation with predictive physics ("port flipped inside out") feels inevitable. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, passing the transformation test via wind-pattern mechanics.</comment>
