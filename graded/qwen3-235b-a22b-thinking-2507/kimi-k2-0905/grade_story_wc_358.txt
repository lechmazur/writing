<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in professional action (marking containers, adapting escape) avoids therapy-speak; micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values (documentation vs survival). Lacks sufficient interior contradiction to reach 9.0 despite strong embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost: "the port had become a living engine" crystallizes irreversible transformation. Accumulative lens holds through patterned escalation (wind measurements tightening toward spiral collapse) without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Shipping containers actively constrain choices (shifting corridors, dead zones) and charge the final image ("containers grinding against each other"). Misses 9.0 as no single object/body/tool constrains a specific choice despite strong environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's agency under Accumulative lens: each wind reading narrows options until the spiral's collapse forces escape. Cost is unmistakable in "containers falling" and "town gone silent," reweighting stakes through lived experience not abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "wind is learning" reframes architecture's agency without moralizing. Final image ("knowledge that would prevent this elsewhere") offers resonant non-literal answer to "can architecture become alive?" with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines through professional lens ("anemometer," "convergence point"); syntax tightens under stress ("She marked each container with chalk"). Purposeful repetition of "hazy precision" modulates meaning without loop artifacts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "hazy precision" functions as patterned diction, not synonym churn. Final line's truncation ("The flight engineer's patch would") delivers earned resonance. Minor deduction for "bruised sky" bordering on cliché despite contextual redemption.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms disaster trope through specific premise (containers as atmospheric engine). Emotional truth in investigator's competence/flaw balance ("rapidly adapting" vs near-fatal curiosity) avoids safety-hedging. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
