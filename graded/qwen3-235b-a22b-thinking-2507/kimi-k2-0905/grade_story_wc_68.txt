<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Caldera’s interior contradiction (preserving truth vs. societal denial) drives her femur-stylus action; embodied emotion in "sedimentary layers inside her own mind shift" avoids therapy-speak. Crowd lacks distinct pressure, slightly flattening stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: "time is a gear that eats its own teeth" reweights the city’s denial with visible cost in the crowd’s recoil. Accumulative lens holds through sedimentary imagery; femur stylus crystallizes the thematic cost decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sewer conduit’s sedimentary layers constrain choices (mapping tunnels by pottery shards) and charge the final image (rising salt cementing truth). "Marble domes jut from tide like broken teeth" establishes setting as active constraint from paragraph one.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via Caldera’s agency: diving for ledgers → prying femur stylus → public declaration. Dominant stake (truth vs. denial) tightens through sedimentary deepening; cost legible in crowd’s hesitation and her "pocketed silent cog" symbolizing fractured trust.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through Caldera’s actions: "survival belonged to those who tasted the world raw" reweights denial without moralizing. Final image (sunrise on arguing world) resonates non-literally; avoids "Thematic Echo" by embedding insight in character voice, not authorial assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "sewage-tasting micro-doses" and "tides instead of time." Voice modulates from reflective ("abrasive calm") to urgent ("spoke her first public words"); no head-hopping despite crowd presence. Rhythmic control peaks in lyrical cadence of "peeling strata of denial."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Abrasive calm" repetition creates minor scaffold loop; otherwise flawless propulsion. "Fossil of shame" metaphor avoids muddle by tying to physical sediment. Final line’s "tide of storytellers" crystallizes theme with zero fat; rhythm accelerates perfectly into closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms plague allegory through specific "sewage-tasting" logic and sewer archaeology. Originality in "counter-clock" concept; emotional truth in Caldera’s quiet endurance. Avoids abstraction via visceral details like "census parchment whose ink bled faces into numbers."</comment>
