<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Caldera’s embodied contradiction—soot-black fingers tasting sewage while rejecting vaccines—drives micro-choices (femur stylus, lead-sheet etching) that earn her final public stance with visible cost: the crowd’s recoil crystallizes isolation as price for truth-telling. No therapy-speak; flaws (obsession with sediment) compound her alienation without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: her counter-narrative wedged in silt reweights time as "a gear that eats its own teeth," with cost legible in the crowd’s hesitation and her internal "sedimentary layers shift." Accumulative lens holds perfectly—pressure builds through sediment layers to this crystallized final image under undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sewer’s sedimentary layers function as essential micro-setting, constraining every choice (descent = time, silt-blinded eyes) and charging the final image: surfacing through black water beneath a "half-collapsed belfry" where abrasive calm mirrors her earned endurance. Environment isn’t backdrop but the story’s honest chronicle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation through Caldera’s deepening realization (cog’s two futures → counter-clock) narrows options to one brutal trade-off: truth’s cost is exile. Agency drives all turns, but the crowd’s recoil—while potent—feels slightly distant from visceral physical stakes, softening the cost’s immediacy just below 9.0 threshold.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: ledgers’ "competing narratives" as ballast, not accident, reweights denial as fossilized shame. Final line avoids moralizing, offering resonant answer—"choose the rotation that leaves you fewer lies"—that recharges the cog motif with undeniable conceptual cost, no thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("marble domes jut like broken teeth") and rhythmic control under pressure ("slow filtration, letting every claim drip through doubt") mirror Caldera’s methodical mind. Voice modulates from reflective to urgent without slippage; the cog’s "ghost heartbeat" crystallizes her psyche in syntax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sedimentary layers of denial" and "laminated rows" of corpses weave density with propulsion. One borderline elevated phrase ("chronometers judged by loyal disagreement with shore") risks register drift but is redeemed by Caldera’s philosopher-voice and closure payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of plague narrative with geological metaphor ("drowned bones," sedimentary denial) transforms tropes through specific sewage-tasting logic. Risk-taking (sewer philosopher) heightens stakes coherently, though "abrasive calm" motif slightly echoes common dystopian textures without transcendent novelty.</comment>
