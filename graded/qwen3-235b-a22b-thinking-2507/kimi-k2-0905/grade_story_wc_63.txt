<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in the brother’s ghost versus villagers’ fear, but "ethically diligent" is told not shown; micro-choices like carving "r" reveal values, though brother’s absence weakens relational crucible despite strong embodied guilt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "for-give" clacking against iron reconfigures the sea’s retreat with conceptual cost, though the lens (Accumulative/Textural) wobbles mid-story when "spilling hoarded minutes" lacks immediate pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tidal obsidian ridge constrains every choice—narrowing annually, grinding bone—and charges the final image ("glowing like a blade turned away"); the rake handle’s wood dust on escapement wheel is micro-setting perfection, making environment indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully around "spilling hoarded minutes" versus sea eating land, but the cost of slowing time ("arms burning") feels physical without deeper emotional trade-off; agency in attaching the bob is strong, yet villagers’ reaction lacks visceral consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "incremental absolution" etched in wood dust, avoiding moralizing; the final image of "buckets of seed instead of ledgers" resonates non-literally, though "world that finally breathes with the tide" edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "obsidian teeth grinding bone" and "searing reverie," but "ethically diligent" disrupts POV lexicon; rhythmic control excels under pressure, though one register drift ("reverie") mars climax coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Zero loops and high density except "searing reverie"—a stock phrase violating clock-winder lexicon in a peak beat; "orange grief" brilliantly charges closure, but the drift triggers -0.6 per Overwriting Checks, disallowing 9+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of timekeeping as guilt measurement transforms tropes; the tidal ridge’s obsidian teeth and incremental carving feel inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking (lyric closure) heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
