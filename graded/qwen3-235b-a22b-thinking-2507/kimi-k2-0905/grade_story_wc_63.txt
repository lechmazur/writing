<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (duty vs. absolution) manifest in carving "r" and lashing handle to pendulum; "ethically diligent" trait tested by compensating for slowed beat with "arms burning," avoiding label-only execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "for-give clack... teaching sea to retreat" reconfigures tidal conflict with conceptual cost (villagers carry "seed instead of ledgers"), fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens with unmistakable stakes shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Obsidian ridge constrains every choice—"grinding bone" pressure forces the swing decision—and final image ("wet furrows reflecting sky") charges setting with thematic weight, exceeding micro-setting gate for 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten during pendulum's hover ("heartbeat to choose"), but escalation relies slightly on predetermined "—e." resolution; cost legible when villagers "walk slower" with seeds, though pressure could deepen earlier.</comment>
<question>5</question><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: handle's transformation from apology tool to pendulum bob reweights forgiveness without moralizing; final image implies renewal through "soil will emerge," avoiding thematic echo.</comment><grade>9.3</grade>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct voice via character-specific diction ("ticking debt," "searing reverie") and rhythmic control; "obsidian teeth grinding bone" embodies stress without diagnostic labels, though "reverie" slightly abstracts under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density ("black glass hissing like hot iron"), but "searing reverie of salt" risks abstraction in climax; no figurative muddle as all images charge closure (e.g., "wet furrows" crystallizing earned change).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms time/debt tropes through fishhook-carved inscriptions and obsidian ridge erosion; "incremental absolution" mechanics feel inevitable, with risk-taking (slowing time as societal reset) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
