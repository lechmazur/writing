<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "metallic and impossible to swallow" line; micro-choices like valve presentation reveal hierarchy of values. Slight over-articulation in final dialogue risks therapy-speak but redeemed by embodied cost of empty satchel.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the folded tone crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost ("echo of your note into the first entry"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds throughout with density increasing toward resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Trumpet functions as micro-setting that constrains choices and charges final image ("folded into every doorway like a page finally turned"). Harbor’s silence actively shapes tactics—missing mouthpiece prevents "heartening" until reassembly completes the tool’s narrative purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by archivist’s agency: valve assembly deepens knowledge ("shape of what had been removed"), then mouthpiece quest forces trade-off (satchel for echo). Cost crystallizes in final image—silence transformed but exile’s metallic taste remains.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image reweights "navigated absences" theme non-literally: trumpet’s tone folding into doorways answers "what absence sounded like" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo through concrete action—compiling echoes replaces abstract hope with archival labor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: "cobblestone a word washed away" filters harbor through archivist’s textual lens. Rhythmic control peaks in staggered intervals cadence ("breath through staggered intervals of fear and forgiveness")—no head-hopping despite dual POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "pitted brass" and "ink pooled like blood under scar tissue" achieve high density without muddle. Only near-slip: "mechanism still drunk on storm water" risks anthropomorphism but pays off via bell’s delayed clang as memory metaphor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms exile trope through archival lens: "ocean-spray archivist" reframes memory as physical assembly. Risk-taking (textual metaphors as causal drivers) heightens stakes without gimmickry—trumpet’s reassembly makes absence navigable.</comment>
