<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Mara’s performative narration masking vulnerability; her abandonment of the dome earns closure through prior micro-choices (bookmark placement, fire-making), with grief’s embodied cost palpable in "emotional tectonic shift that did not break her."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands flawlessly: Mara’s realization that "safe zones belong wherever needed" forecloses her flight path with felt cost (leaving the dome), under Accumulative/Textural lens where drip-lines and narration cadence tighten pressure toward crystallized reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choices—the thawing ice fuels glasswork, the swivel chair becomes firewood—and charges the final image as "rivulets conducting a metallic symphony that echoed her pulse," making environment inseparable from emotional thaw.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes (will grief remain frozen or thaw?) deepen through Mara’s agency: the cornice crash tests her confidence, leading to the pivotal abandonment choice that forecloses escape, with cost legible in "leaving dome and bookmark behind like a lighthouse."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through glass-domes-as-sanctuaries; the final line ("heart light enough to lift her footprints") resonates as a non-literal answer to "safe zones for inquiry," avoiding moralizing while reweighting sorrow’s purpose through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mercury dreams for tomorrow’s colors") reflects Mara’s glassblower lens, with rhythmic control deepening under pressure; narration-as-action ("The cartographer exits the map") avoids dialogue pitfalls while modulating emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "drip-lines racing down rusted panels" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor abstraction in "atmosphere of weighty lightness" barely dents otherwise crystalline lines where every phrase advances atmosphere or character under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of glassblowing grief therapy transforms tropes; the "thawing heart" manifests through specific bodily stakes (fear since "the funeral she never attended"), avoiding genericity while the abandoned control room’s transformation feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
