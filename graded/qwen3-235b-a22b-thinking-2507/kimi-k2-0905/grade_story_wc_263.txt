<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in dismantling the telescope to free stardust memory, with embodied emotion ("breath frosting the latitude scale"). Slight knowledge breach when stardust "remembered every similar wound" breaks character-bound perspective.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands flawlessly: dissolution into stardust carries undeniable conceptual cost ("colorblind in the soul"). Accumulative lens holds through meteor-syllable progression, with orientation anchored in first 40 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Astronomical instrument functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (dismantling screws) and charging the final image ("circle of dark glass"). Tundra lacks specific sensory texture beyond cold, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (creativity's survival) tightens through meteor syllables to "create, or perish," with dissolution as visible cost. Escalation slightly passive—the aurora delivers the warning rather than protagonist driving discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars ("crayon nebulae with long division"), avoiding moralizing. Final reprise of "create, or perish" as invitation reweights the phrase without stating a moral, though "soul colorblind" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "reading the sky like Braille" and rhythmic control under pressure. One forced metaphor ("migraine of unborn constellations") prevents 9.3+, but no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops with high propulsion; "liquid light" threading her outline exemplifies textural density. Minor clichés ("calcified into ordinary bone," aurora as "bruise") prevent 9.0+, but no closure-dulling artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "create or perish" through astronomical metaphor and dissolution into stardust. Emotional specificity in classroom flashbacks avoids templates, though the core phrase’s familiarity caps near 9.0.</comment>
