<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("rational" vs. occluding truth) embodied in micro-choices like pocketing the eye then confessing; flaw-driven compounding (can't bury eye) earns final endurance. "Mouths open, every confession looping" shows contradictory emotions without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: "fractured grace" reweights truth as refracted light with visible cost (surrendering narrative control). Accumulative escalation via confession density holds lens; "ferry rope still around her wrists" crystallizes irreversible loss without apology.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Ravine setting actively constrains choices—storms force confessions, truffle skins mute relics. Final image ("holding broken things up to the light") charges closure through environment; orchard evolves causally from fruit to glass eyes, mirroring internal transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safety vs. truth) tightens when discarding the eye risks harming others, forcing deeper ravine descent. Protagonist agency drives escalation (planting eye), with cost legible in "I did not apologize" and enduring the orchard's truth-system.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: glass eyes refracting light embodies "fractured grace" as non-literal answer to psychological safety. Avoids moralizing; final image reweights truth as cultivated ecosystem pruned by lightning, not binary good/evil.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("truffles slick with soil," "resin" speech) with rhythmic control under pressure ("wind threading through trunks like piano wire"). Subtext in ghost interaction; no head-hopping despite multi-character closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "roots drinking confession" multiplies meaning without scaffolding. Minor deduction for "psychological safety" bordering clinical diction, offset by context; final line’s ellipsis creates earned cadence shift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: empathy virus meets orchard-as-confessional where truth composts into fruit. "Fractured grace" transforms trope through specific stakes; risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
