<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("rational truffle forager who no longer trusted the word rational") manifests physically through truffle-induced memory of mother's death lie; embodied fear crystallizes in "I am afraid the quiet will be worse than the noise" with visible cost in shattered branch and lost mixture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: protagonist drinks mixture "not to erase, but to carry them more gently," reconfiguring the central stake through "roots relaxed their nooses; fruits stilled" while the ravine becomes internalized. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Environment actively constrains choice: hanging orchard's "roots like nooses" and storm-battered trees force precarious movement; luminous mud literally wraps ankles, charging the final image where "roots drinking the mixture" transforms setting into active participant in psychological safety.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (psychological safety vs. authentic connection) tightens through sensory density: truffle scent forces swallowed apologies, glass eye heat demands confession, luminous film reveals consequences. Cost crystallizes in "roots relaxed their nooses" after protagonist chooses to carry pain rather than mute it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Final image ("roots drinking the mixture, preparing to dangle sweeter fruit") offers resonant answer to "muting them or holding them" without moralizing; theme emerges from concrete actions (scooping luminous mud to drink "not to erase") rather than abstraction, with ambiguity in "safely tethered by truthful silence."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("rational truffle forager" lexicon) modulates under pressure: short fragments during crisis ("burning through wool, insisting on being seen") contrast with lyrical calm post-closure; no head-hopping despite spectral voice, maintained through focalized uncertainty ("where no body stood").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion: "The mixture hissed, releasing a breath that tasted of every apology I had swallowed" compresses sensory, emotional, and causal weight. Only microscopic flaw: slight repetition of "involuntarily truthful" (justified as thematic anchor).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms empathy virus trope through specific lived detail: "storms that tasted of other people’s regrets" and truffles "remembering every unspoken farewell" ground abstract concept in visceral botany. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, culminating in "fractured grace" reconfiguration.</comment>
