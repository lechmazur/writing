<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in scholarly precision ("weathered innocence," writing "in memory"); testimony choice earns credible endurance with visible cost in the "sad smile" at "zygote." No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions manifest through embodied action (reticence vs. compelled testimony).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the "sad movement" at "zygote" crystallizes conceptual cost under Accumulative lens. Pattern taught early ("suspended hush," crystal's first hum); orientation solid by line 5. Cost proof evident in "zygote" reweighted as "a beginning, then."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Library micro-setting charges closure: snowdrop in *Botanical Studies* directly constrains Elara’s realization ("growth was not always upward"). Dawn light progression tracks time pressure; crystal as recurring object charges final image ("placed it on the desk, beside the last dictionary").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes ("decode silence before language dies") escalate through protagonist-driven testimony triggering the book fall. Cost unmistakable in the "sad smile" at "zygote"—a conceptual forfeiture of linguistic finality. Pressure tightens via sequence accumulation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: snowdrop and "zygote" reconfigure "growth" without moralizing. Final image ("first thread in its new spine") offers resonant answer to "language ended" via library’s living memory. Avoids thematic echo; wisdom earned through Austen reader/boy fragments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: scholar’s precise observations ("sonically reflective," "weathered innocence") modulate rhythm under pressure ("She began to write, not in ink but in memory"). Zero filter verbs; syntax compresses during tension ("possible, possible") while maintaining voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("quiet apocalypse of language" conveys stakes + worldbuilding). Final line charges motif ("first thread in its new spine"). No figurative muddle: metaphors serve pressure ("hush that clung like dust motes"). Opening/ending lines anchor with crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "haunted library" trope via linguistic apocalypse premise. Fresh inflection: library as accumulator of human moments (Austen reader’s tears) rather than ghosts. "Zygote" reconfiguration feels inevitable yet surprising; specificity (p. 237 crying) avoids generality. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
