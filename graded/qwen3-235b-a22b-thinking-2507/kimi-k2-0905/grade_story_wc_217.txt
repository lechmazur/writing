<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (completion vs. incompleteness) drives the final renunciation, but embodied emotion lacks visceral specificity; "warmly attentive" repeats without deepening micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the erased sand writing becomes part of "woven dawns," crystallizing sufficiency in incompleteness with felt cost ("a net of almosts to keep him... alive"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds flawlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The drake feather constrains choices (tucking in tin, drawing spiral) and charges the final image ("hollow of the feather"); "cobalt lagoon" evolves causally from reflective surface to dissolving spiral, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation: horizon "wounded" by storm tightens to the chord's tension, with cost legible in the poet's sufficiency ("not finished but sufficient"). Agency is attention, foreclosing completion with conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the spiral dissolving yet "chord... remaining," reweighting incompleteness as beauty's doorway; avoids moralizing via sand writing's erasure, which becomes "part of woven dawns."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("barbs holding violet of dawn," "sea glass clouded to old longing") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control sustains Accumulative lens through "minor note... tense chord" cadence shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "burnished hush" evolves meaningfully without figurative muddle. Slight register drift in "harmonizing discord into a loom of almost" risks abstraction but is redeemed by tactile spiral-drawing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "incompleteness" trope through specific, lived details (torn feather vane, cracked zither); risk-taking (lyric accumulation over causality) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
