<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("task not to finish the chord") is embodied in micro-choices like pressing feather into sand, but the woman's sudden appearance lacks prior causality for their dynamic; her chipped tooth feels tacked-on rather than integrated flaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the tide erasing sand writing while the "chord" persists reconfigures meaning with felt cost ("net of almosts to keep him... alive"), though the kite’s reappearance edges toward coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The drake feather functions as micro-setting that charges closure—tucked behind the woman’s ear as a "question," it constrains the poet’s final action and embodies the theme, elevating specificity beyond mere atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes ("discover beauty in the incomplete") deepen through the spiral act, narrowing options to "let it hover," but the wound metaphor for the horizon remains abstract without concrete pressure until the spiral dissolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the spiral’s dissolution—"Incomplete is the only doorway beauty knows how to use"—reweighting the feather and shards without moralizing; the final image crystallizes earned ambiguity about imperfection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("warmly attentive to every shard") creates rhythmic control under pressure; syntax mirrors the poet’s focus ("a clam shell gnawed into a crescent moon"), with no head-hopping despite dual characters.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Barbs still holding the violet of dawn" edges toward overwriting, but the payoff ("syllables were tiny mirrors") justifies density; zero loops or scaffold, though "burnished hush" repeats without escalation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms shoreline tropes via tactile fragments (plastic soldier missing rifle arm); the "woven dawns" synthesis feels inevitable when the spiral dissolves into humming shells, avoiding abstraction through specific, verifiable detail.</comment>
