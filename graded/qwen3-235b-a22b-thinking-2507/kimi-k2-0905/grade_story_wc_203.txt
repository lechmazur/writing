<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara's technician pragmatism versus ghostly burden; micro-choices like re-coiling the spring "leaving enough tension for possibility" embody earned renunciation with felt cost ("cracks in herself" realization).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis with undeniable cost: Mara's self-realization about "cracks" forecloses easy resolution while the sealed mainspring transfers ghosts' weight. Accumulative lens holds through dust-pattern escalation to the cupola's spiral reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dust accumulation patterns function as micro-setting that constrains choice (guiding her to safe/vent) and charges the final image (ringmaster's dust completing the ceiling spiral), satisfying the 9+ gate through tactical necessity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Mara's agency: analyzing dust patterns leads to climbing the ladder, narrowing options to one vertical path. Cost is unmistakable in her physical/emotional shift ("weightless burden transferred to the mainspring") under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the mainspring barrel's re-coiling offers a resonant answer to "carrying ghosts" without moralizing. Final image reweights time and repair as cyclical burden ("let the building lift their stories floor by floor").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: Mara's technician gaze ("dust patterns spelled a spiral") shapes all observation. Voice modulates perfectly under pressure—clinical when analyzing, lyrical only when ghosts act ("calliope music, bright and merciless").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero scaffold; every line advances pressure (e.g., "boots crunching on old coupons" conveys spatial choreography and tension). Figurative language stays precise ("glitter the color of rust") without muddying the cupola climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms elevator repair tropes through ghost-seer specificity: the mainspring barrel isn't just a plot device but a vessel for "vertical desire." Risk-taking (occupational fusion) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable by closure.</comment>
