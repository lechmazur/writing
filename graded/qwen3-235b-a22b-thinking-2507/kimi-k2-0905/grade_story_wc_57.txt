<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority shines through concrete actions like cracking fulgurite beads; "infinitely patient" manifests in rope-handling under pressure. Micro-choices (sliding rope under coat, planting in snow) reveal hierarchy of values with cost. No stock phrasing; kelp-colored eyes embody emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: the sprouting seed reweights "heritage is a seed" against bureaucratic erasure. Accumulative lens holds via density increase in rope decoding. Fog transition teaches pattern early; no causality breaks. Final image charges cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Golden dock constrains choice (planting in snow) and charges closure via green shoot. Fulgurite glass functions as micro-setting that alters tactics. Sensory details filter through Ari’s priorities ("hemp syllables," "winter kelp eyes"). No white-room syndrome; snow/dock actively pressure choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through Ari’s refusal to surrender rope: living tradition vs. "data rot." One tightening (harbormaster’s approach) forces planting under Accumulative lens. Cost is visceral in final image—sprouting where "maps claimed nothing could grow." Moral calculus between heritage and regulation sharpens peak choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through rope’s language: "choreography" of seeds reweights preservation as active resistance. Final image ("new fibers of light") offers non-literal answer to "heritage is a seed" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; storm-corn’s salt-drinking roots embody complexity. No abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("knots shone faintly," "oceanic hush") modulates with pressure. Rhythmic control peaks in decoding sequence: "three-strand spiral, two half-hitches, slack loop" mirrors rope’s tension. No head-hopping; fog transition teaches compression. Lexicon stays within Ari’s plausible voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "green shoot speared upward" shows propulsion. Figurative language serves pressure ("brittle rosary of sky-fire" in high-stakes beat). Sentence rhythm varies: short staccato for confrontation, flowing cadence for reflection. No register drift; "fulgurite" fits seed-collector lexicon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms seed-collecting trope via nautical "secret weavers" and fulgurite physics. Fresh synthesis: storm-corn roots drinking salt makes heritage tangible. Avoids derivative pitfalls; specificity (barnacled posts, marline) grounds universals. Bold structural choice—ropes as language—heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
