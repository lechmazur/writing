<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete action (rope-warming breath), contradictions manifest in physical choices (stealing seeds vs reverence for planting), and the final endurance as Earned Stasis carries palpable cost through the shoot's fragile emergence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes the heritage-vs-preservation stake with conceptual cost: the dock's rebirth proves living tradition's value, while the harbormaster's failure to confiscate the rope demonstrates the cost of bureaucratic rigidity on the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fulgurite glass functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (warming without shattering) and charges the final image (new "fibers of light"), while the dock's golden planks evolve from creaking barrier to living root substrate, directly enabling the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Ari's agency—decoding knots under pressure—when the harbormaster's intrusion forces immediate action, narrowing options to planting or losing the seed; cost is legible in the physical fragility of the fulgurite and the shoot's vulnerable emergence through snow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the rope's knots become the "non-literal answer" to cultural preservation, with the final image reweighting "heritage" as living action (seed in snow) versus sterile artifact (glass case), avoiding explicit moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in marine-specific lexicon ("marline," "reef sail") and tactile rope focus; rhythmic control peaks during the fulgurite-cracking beat where syntax compresses ("With thumb and nail she cracked one glass bead") without losing voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere or pressure ("brittle rosary of sky-fire" fuses image, texture, and thematic weight), with peak-beat propulsion during the harbormaster confrontation where sentence fragments heighten urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms folklore tropes through hyper-specific marine botany ("storm-corn whose roots drank salt") and knot-encoding mechanics; the fulgurite's fusion of lightning/sand/rope creates an indispensable, non-derivative engine for both plot and theme.</comment>
