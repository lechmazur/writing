<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("aesthetically driven") with sparse embodied contradiction; the pulse-as-certainty motif elevates micro-choices like the phoneme shift, but "recusant" backstory remains told rather than dramatized cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "lake kept rewriting its surface" crystallizes irreversible change with conceptual cost (dissolved borders), driven by Accumulative/Textural lens where every paraphrase intensifies pressure through the quartz harmonics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The humming quartz colonnade constrains every choice—pulse recognition, phoneme shifts, ice dissolution—and charges the final image ("rehearsing its first wave"), making environment the engine of the thematic closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the poet’s escalating paraphrases ("None shall pass" → "None shall stay"), with visceral cost in the freezing risk, but the abstract "boundary law" lacks concrete relational urgency beyond systemic opposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the colonnade’s harmonic shift (A-flat to G-sharp) and "borders are parentheses" line, culminating in the final couplet’s non-literal resolution: "What freezes can learn flow" reweights the entire premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sonic detail ("A-flat," "lantern timing") and rhythmic control under pressure; the poet’s lexicon ("refracted light," "dissolving margins") remains character-specific even at peak tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "quartz harmonies braid with her heartbeat" exemplifies high-density propulsion, though "tremor of certainty" risks thematic echo without the physical pulse anchor in critical beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of poetry-as-law-revision feels inevitable: dissolving ice via phoneme shifts transforms rebellion tropes through the colonnade’s material logic, with "paraphrase" as both action and philosophical stance.</comment>
