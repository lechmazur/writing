<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (solve for motion vs stillness) drive micro-choices; final renunciation of certainty earned through tactile actions like aligning glass eyes. No diagnostic label-speak; grief embodied in "recited primes under my breath" during high-pressure activation sequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "ambiguous loss remained—no body, no farewell—but the equation now possessed a limit I could approach." Accumulative lens holds throughout; orchard's resumed dripping reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cavern orchard functions as active constraint: drip timing ("slow enough to count its oscillations") pressures choices, while calcite fruit directly charges closure as "each drop a note restored to the score." Micro-setting qualifies by altering tactics during activation sequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency (rotating glass eyes, harvesting seedlings) under Accumulative lens. Cost legible in "ambiguous loss remained" but slightly abstract; physical price (master's absence) lacks concrete on-page manifestation during final drip sequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ending delivers resonant answer via "mathematics of emotion finally summing to motion"—a non-literal resolution reweighting the master's "solve for motion" lesson. Theme emerges through crystalline particulars (astrolabe, seedlings) without moralizing; ambiguity preserved yet charged.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "coat of starling feathers" and counting drip oscillations, but "locus of possible intersections" momentarily drifts into academic register inconsistent with conjurer's lexicon during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion maintained through rhythmic fragments ("one, two, three"). Slight overwriting in "tectonic plates of turquoise memory" creates minor figurative muddle during high-stakes activation beat, barely obscuring closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope through math-magic synthesis: "dovetail with the dark" reappears as earned motif. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over plot) heightens stakes coherently; "integral sign cradling a heart" feels inevitable in hindsight with specific emotional calculus.</comment>
