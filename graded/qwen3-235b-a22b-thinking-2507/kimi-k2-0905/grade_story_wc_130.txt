<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("solve for motion, not stillness") embodied through concrete actions (reciting primes, rotating glass eyes); final choice to harvest seedlings earns ambiguous closure with felt cost ("no body, no farewell").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: dripping resumes while "ambiguous loss remained," reconfiguring grief with conceptual cost; Accumulative lens holds through density increase (drip counting to stone opening) with persistent constraint (chipped mosaic).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Mosaic stepping stone functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (alignment triggers opening) and charges final image (petals sealing); stalactite drip mechanics directly enable the ritual’s success, avoiding postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency (rotating eyes, wedging them in tree) under Accumulative lens; cost unmistakable in "ambiguous loss remained—no body, no farewell—but the equation now possessed a limit" during closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Ending offers non-literal answer via "mathematics of emotion finally summing to motion," reweighting grief through seedlings sprouting; avoids moralizing by embedding theme in ritual (astrolabe’s dented rim where "grief had pressed").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("listening for the missing heartbeat of the cave") with rhythmic compression under pressure ("one, two, three"); voice modulation evident in math-inflected diction ("locus of possible intersections") taught from first line.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; "petals of rock folding inward" achieves high density without muddle; only microscopic flaw is "gently inventive" repetition, but thematic resonance justifies it as intentional pattern.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of math/grief metaphors ("solve for motion") transforms mentor-loss trope; cavern orchard’s crystalline logic feels specific and inevitable, with risk-taking (astrolabe as emotional calculator) heightening coherence.</comment>
