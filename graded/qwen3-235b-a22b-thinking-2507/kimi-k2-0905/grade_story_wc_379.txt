<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses (curator vs. witness) drive her renunciation of fixing; micro-choices like sitting cross-legged without tools earn her shift. Secondary characters lack depth but serve pressure. "Dust between her ribs" avoids therapy-speak through embodied specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: mailbox quiets as heartbeat merges with dawn sounds, reconfiguring stakes with visible cost ("space between bodies tuned"). Accumulative lens holds through density escalation; cost legible in Mira’s "not to sell but to display" action. Final click risks sentimentality but avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Courtyard constrains choices (sitting on tiles, neighbors forming crescents) and charges closure via "empty velvet cushion." Micro-setting mastery: locket’s heartbeat merges with sparrows/sprinklers, reweighting the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mira’s curator lens ("brass compasses, cracked ouds").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mira’s agency: following locket’s echo, then sitting without tools. Cost is visceral—her renunciation of transactional solutions ("not to sell but to display"). Conflict resolves cleanly under accumulative lens, though the shift from rattling to quiet feels slightly frictionless.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: offerings on cushion prove "listening opened a valve," avoiding final-paragraph moralizing. Central question reweighted by final image—"space between bodies tuned" crystallizes healing without stating it. "Calm of a sandstorm" borders on aphorism but stays earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("curator of every forgotten thing") with rhythmic control: "lub-dub, lub-dub" compression under stress contrasts lyrical dawn prose. Voice modulates perfectly—"desert cold teach her" embodies learning. No head-hopping; dialogue snippets carry subtext via concrete cues (sesame bread, locket memory).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("tales settle like dust between her ribs"). Final line resonates without cliché. Minor overwriting in "soft metronome against stethoscope" risks bodily cliché, but "dust between her ribs" redeems through context-specific embodiment. Closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: locket as heartbeat transforms "listening heals" trope via cultural specifics (ouds, sesame bread). Risk-taking in accumulative structure pays off—mystery absorbed, not solved. Avoids safety middle with Mira’s credible shift from proof-seeking to witnessing. Near-echo of magical realism tropes but sufficiently personalized.</comment>
