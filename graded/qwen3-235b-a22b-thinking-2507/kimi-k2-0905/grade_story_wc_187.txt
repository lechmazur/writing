<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Archivist’s embodied ritual (fabric tribute) reveals values, but internal conflict remains underdeveloped; "preemptive nostalgia" informs action yet lacks contradictory impulses. Final endurance as witness earns closure, though motivation stays elegantly abstract rather than deeply personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: signing the spiral as witness crystallizes stakes with felt cost ("footprints dissolving"). Orientation anchors instantly; Accumulative/Textural lens holds as shadow measurements tighten into the map-spiral reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Solid fog functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choices—it stores memories she interacts with, dictates her tribute ritual, and dissolves to end her role. The observatory’s dual function as "lantern and lens" charges the final image with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving memory against erasure) tighten through shadow-length changes and the hush’s tribute demand, narrowing options toward the map’s creation. Cost is legible in fabric sacrifice and impending erasure, though protagonist agency leans observational rather than combative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete acts: signing the spiral becomes "a child’s urge to draw on fogged windows," reweighting memory as collective inheritance. Avoids moralizing; the final dissolution offers non-literal answer to "sculpting identity" without stated thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in tactile details ("summer-stiff quill smelling of sun-dried reeds"); rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure ("wet silk pulled across marble"). Zero head-hopping; lyric compression taught early via "fog became solid" anchors the lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythmically ("Thunder rolled... air was glass-calm"). Figurative language serves momentum without muddle—only minor deduction for "crystal whispering forecourt after rain" repetition slightly bloating closure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms memory tropes through irreplaceable mechanics: solid fog storing moments, shadow-lengths as historical record. "Preemptive nostalgia" synthesizes fresh emotional logic; risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
