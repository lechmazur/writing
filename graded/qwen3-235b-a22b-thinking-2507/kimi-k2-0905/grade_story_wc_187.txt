<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("purity felt like amputation") and embodied emotion ("tears blurred her field notes—she could no longer tell which sorrow was hers") crystallize micro-choices under pressure; the archivist’s final renunciation of singular identity earns closure through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: "purity felt like amputation" crystallizes the cost, and "Fragment is also form" reweights the premise via conceptual repricing under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the translucent figure’s creation forecloses the path of erasure with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (measuring shadows, arranging pellets) and charges the final image (the figure absorbing dawn’s color); sensory specificity ("hexagonal tiles that spoke in soft, wet voices") filters through the archivist’s professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via the archivist’s agency: her shadow measurements narrow options toward the ossification moment, and the fog pellet’s impact ("released a stranger’s memory") deepens knowledge with felt cost, though the tightening lacks one persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the translucent figure’s "blank face, waiting for future footsteps" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to collective memory’s cost, avoiding moralizing while embracing complexity ("identity did not need erasure, only arrangement").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("parchment damp with mist that had begun to harden into brittle scales") and rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping, with lyrical compression taught early ("thunder rolled like archival carts") and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("solid fog pellets clattered... each pellet a lost name") propels momentum, though "brittle scales" to "frozen sea" repetition slightly dilutes final-beat clarity without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of archival duty and identity fragmentation feels inevitable; the "translucent figure" reconfiguration transforms tropes through specific, lived stakes ("sculpting a small, translucent figure: herself and not herself") without abstraction.</comment>
