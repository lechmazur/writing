<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lucien's contradiction—artistic integrity versus social utility—drives micro-choices (burning stick, speaking backward) with embodied cost ("brief pain" of burns). Epiphany earned through granular sensory struggle, not abstract labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance via "I will letter... with questions," with conceptual cost in stardust grains. Accumulative lens holds: smoke-puppet sequence deepens ethical stakes through patterned reversals, narrowing options toward irrevocable stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dome actively pressures choices (moonlight for writing, ghost transmissions guiding reversal). Story stick as micro-setting constrains action—burning it enables narrative reversal—charging final image where satellites read ash-scripted manifesto.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake (art's purpose) signaled early via gallery quarrel. Agency-driven deepening: reversal sequence forces Lucien to confront grandmother's wisdom, narrowing options to "questions rather than answers" with visible cost (dissolved puppets → stardust on skin).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "every character contains both truth and lie" reweights via smoke-puppet reversal. Final image (ash-scripted dome) offers non-literal answer without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo in manifesto's earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in calligrapher's lexicon ("equations of regret," "parchment-like skin"). Rhythmic control under pressure: backward speech compresses syntax ("syllables reversing like calligraphy strokes undone") without voice erosion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold; "smoke curl into equations of regret" fuses image/concept without muddle. Final line recharges "meteor hush" motif with closure weight. Propulsion flawless—no figurative overwriting in peak beats (reversal sequence).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of calligraphy, radar tech, and puppetry avoids tropes. Bold structural risk (backward speech) heightens stakes coherently. Emotional truth in artist's crisis transcends surface novelty, though "subversive puppet shows" slightly edges toward familiar rebellion.</comment>
