<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lucien’s ethical crisis drives micro-choices (burning stick, reversing speech) that crystallize his stance with visible cost (finger burn, dissolving puppets), though "uncommonly serene" trait lacks contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: ash-ink manifesto reconfigures the argument’s meaning with conceptual cost (embracing unresolved friction), under Accumulative/Textural lens where smoke-density intensifies the ethical revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome functions as micro-setting—satellite ghost transmissions directly constrain Lucien’s reversal method, while the story stick’s ash literally charges the final image as ethical ink.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pressure tightens through sensory density (smoke equations, marionette gestures), but the gallery argument’s stakes remain abstract; cost is felt via Lucien’s physical pain and dissolving puppets, though external consequences lack teeth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ash-ink manifesto offers resonant subtext ("letter not conclusions but doorways"), but the final line’s explicit "reversal is not erasure but revelation" edges toward thematic echo, slightly diluting earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("ink-stained fingers," "equations of regret"), with rhythm modulating under pressure; lyric compression taught early (meteor hush, half-lit epiphanies) pays off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density ("smoke curl into equations of regret"), and rhythmic propulsion dominate, though "equations" slightly drifts from calligrapher lexicon in a high-pressure beat, marring otherwise flawless craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of calligraphy/puppetry reframes ethical storytelling; risk-taking (backward speech, smoke marionettes) heightens stakes without gimmickry, with ash-ink solution feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
