<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (thrill vs cold dread) drive her to listen rather than conquer; final choice to frame maps "with room for mystery" earns endurance with cost shown in sternum’s echo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis: reknitting map charges the final image with conceptual cost (mastery → mystery); Accumulative lens holds as silence density deepens stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Spirals that "drink sound" constrain choice (entering the ring deepens hush) and charge the final image; mist-as-gauze mirrors her split self, evolving from obstacle to woven roof.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via deepening: silence shifts from absence of birds to "accumulated silence" of sailors, narrowing options to empathetic listening; cost legible in sternum’s echo.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final map reknitting offers non-literal answer: empathy as "shielded openness" reweights mastery into mystery; avoids moralizing via concrete ink-repair and henge’s persistent silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "parchment pulse faintly, like a thing breathing through ink" filters world through mapmaker’s senses; rhythm modulates from methodical to breathless awe.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fox-fire" glow and "shy fingers" reknitting deliver high density without muddle; final line’s "drumming loud and ordinary" resolves rhythm with closure charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: henge as listener-circle reframes mystery not as conquest but empathetic witness; risk-taking (silence as active force) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
