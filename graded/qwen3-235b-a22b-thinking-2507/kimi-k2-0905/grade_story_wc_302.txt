<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "cautious exuberance" versus restored lie, but "cautious exuberance fluttered in her throat like a moth" leans abstract. Micro-choices (unlying, blood-letters) earn closure, though heartbeat delay lacks embodied degradation under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds perfectly: pressure builds through library's spoken grammar and propagation delays. Charged Poise closure lands with visceral cost (returned scream, restored lie) in final riverbank awakening. No orientation debt; "between two fateful letters" timeframe creates urgent, live pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choices: stepping left/right pronounces vowels/consonants, mist curls letters into question marks. Watch functions as micro-setting charging the final image (ticking correctly at riverbank). Every detail serves pressure—algae light drips, shelves breathe, petrified breath desk records pulse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (time/language debt) escalate through visceral trade-offs: heartbeat arrives late, shadow lags, scream sucked into vacuum. Peak choice (seizing syllable-key) driven by agency under accumulative lens. Cost unmistakable when lullaby memory is swallowed and lie restored—no coincidence resolves tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through library mechanics: "the word you seek is the breath you withhold." Ending's fragment—"survives in what you choose not to"—resonantly answers the central question without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers on whether restored lie is loss or preservation, avoiding false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "chandeliers of phosphorescent algae dripped light like slow rain." Rhythmic control under pressure via intentional fragmentation ("She exhaled, and the letters rearranged..."). No head-hopping; "cyclically reversed" motif taught early and paid off in cipher's final light-dot collapse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "mist seeping between pages, curling letters into question marks" does triple duty. One borderline ornamental phrase ("cautious exuberance like a moth") saved by later payoff. Final fragment ("not to") achieves masterful compression without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: library as spoken architecture where time trades places with language. Transforms tropes via specific mechanics (propagation delays, blood-letter Braille). Emotional truth in forgotten apologies that "grew spines and walked" avoids generic templates. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
