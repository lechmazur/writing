<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (seeking vs. becoming the library) drives the climax, but "cautious exuberance" lacks embodied specificity. Micro-choices like documenting via deception reveal hierarchy of values, though emotional progression leans abstract during peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing ("THE LIBRARY IS THE WORD, AND YOU ARE ITS TONGUE") with undeniable cost (dissolution into articulation). Orientation is immediate, and accumulative escalation via cipher echoes tightens pressure without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The library’s physicality ("shelves rearranging into the shape of her open mouth") charges the final image. Micro-settings—the watch’s lie-counting and veil woven from nightmares—constrain choices and embody the core conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the watch’s backward spin and cyclically reversed doors, narrowing options to one decisive act. Agency peaks when she removes the golden thread, paying the visceral cost of dissolution to resolve the dominant conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: the library breathing and final line "Thank you for speaking us" reweights silence into existence without moralizing. No thematic echo—resonance stems from her becoming the library’s newest wing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "phosphorescent tiles that pulsed like slow heartbeats," with rhythmic control deepening under pressure. Minor abstraction in "thought could survive" slightly dilutes embodied urgency at climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops in closure beats, with propulsion in "her scream backward through every unspoken word." One paraphrase loop ("through propagation delays" x4) incurs -0.3, but density remains exceptional without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms "library of unspoken words" through specific mechanics (propagation delays, lie-counting watch). Risk-taking heightens stakes—the cyclically reversed gravity inversion feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
