<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in Mira's expertise vs. humility when maps prove incomplete; micro-choices like whisper-testing show value hierarchy. Slight underdevelopment in woman's academic gait motivation limits full 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost: "realized her maps had been incomplete" crystallizes Mira's professional identity shift. Hybrid lens (causal discovery + accumulative resonance) holds through harmonic climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shipping containers function as acoustic machine constraining every choice; storm disables GPS forcing analog navigation. Final constellation placement charges closure with celestial specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through storm's intensifying interference: GPS failure forces reliance on sound, narrowing options to whispered sequence. Cost is Mira's worldview collapse foreclosing her mapping authority.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: coins placed on celestial carvings reweight "quietest voices travel farthest" without moralizing. Final line resonates as earned CR reconfiguring technological assumptions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices "mechanical rhythms" and "vibrations through walls." Rhythmic control shifts from clipped sentences during tension to flowing cadence at revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding; "creases forming a topography of dead ends" exemplifies high-density imagery. Final line avoids sentimentality through tactile specificity ("edges worn smooth by countless hands").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic physics and war history; shipping labyrinth as whisper network feels inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
