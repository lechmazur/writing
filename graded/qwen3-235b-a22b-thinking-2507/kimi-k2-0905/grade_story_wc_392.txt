<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices—trembling hands revealing recognition, not therapy-speak. Final renunciation of silence ("courage to speak the truth") earns visible cost via tactile journal discovery, avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: walking back "each step a small rebellion" crystallizes stance with felt cost ("hands trembled... with recognition"). Accumulative lens holds through tally marks/journal discoveries tightening pressure without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Tunnel constrains choice (alcove discovery, darkness requiring lantern), while the lantern charges closure—final line ties Underground Railroad symbolism to truth-telling. Sensory specificity ("concrete and bone," "heat grounding her") avoids white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mara’s agency: tally marks force confrontation with complicity, journal triggers visceral recognition. Cost is unmistakable—"trembled with recognition" as memory entanglement becomes tactical fuel for truth-telling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>"The water remembers" evolves from suicide note to thematic core; final lantern image reweights drought’s legacy without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by embedding wisdom in concrete action ("file her report—the story carved into walls").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in drought metaphors ("city felt brittle") and engineer’s gaze. Rhythmic control under pressure: short clauses during memory hit ("unwanted and on schedule") contrast lyrical closure cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "bones picked clean" shows, not tells, emotional hollowing. Figurative language sparse but potent ("tunnel stretched like a throat"), never muddling climax. Final line’s parallel structure charges closure without ornament.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms institutional complicity trope via drought engineering specifics—tally marks in sevens, water rationing as weapon. Emotional truth in linking personal/systemic control avoids abstraction; "calcified complicity" fresh inflection.</comment>
