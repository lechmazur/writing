<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s vulnerability during the whistle tremble, where baby curl memory becomes embodied micro-choice; "salt breath, lullaby hum" avoids therapy-speak by anchoring in sensory recall that alters her action under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: children’s "after-echo" reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost ("pebble in a shoe"), while the curl’s darkening proves tangible price; Accumulative lens holds as sensory density tightens toward totality’s silver-flashing sage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sage Ridge constrains choice through the "suspended hour" time pressure and silver sage’s rain-savor, charging the final image when leaves flash silver; body-as-setting (Elara’s wrist against curl) directly enables the melody’s recovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elara’s agency as the eclipse forces one tightening—whistle tremble overcome by curl memory—narrowing options to "press or fail"; cost legibility peaks when the curl darkens, absorbing stories as the price for rekindled wonder.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the "pebble in a shoe" image, reweighting "ordinary magic" as persistent discomfort; avoids moralizing by having children carry the echo silently, with "color streaming from fingertips" crystallizing wonder’s physical cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in Elara’s sound-centric noticing ("note was neither major nor minor"), with rhythmic control shifting from "thumping satchel" to "fray naturally" during climax; no head-hopping despite multi-character scope.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion stumbles only in "cautious exuberance" (label-over-action), and "trembling rope" slightly muddles metaphor; otherwise, zero loops with high density—e.g., "spoon" and "controller" compress children’s awakening into visceral beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of music therapy with eclipse ritual avoids trope through specific stakes (glazed eyes from screens); "softly adaptive" magic gains emotional truth via curl’s darkening, resisting abstraction while risking lyric density that heightens coherence.</comment>
