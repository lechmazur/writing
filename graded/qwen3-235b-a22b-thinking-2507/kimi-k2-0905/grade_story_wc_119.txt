<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Chen's contradictory impulses (spy/sage, desire for wind-like freedom) manifest in concrete micro-choices like palming film and writing the fortune. Embodied cost in "stones tuning his ribs" avoids therapy-speak, though "accidentally prophetic" edges toward analytical interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Chen's departure crystallizes irreversible identity shift with conceptual cost ("rocky island slide inside him"). The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with the lithophone metaphor reweighting stakes at the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The lighthouse functions as active micro-setting—beam directs exposure for the fortune, granite spine becomes lithophone charging the final image. Sensory details ("moonlit combers smash," "salt wind") filter through Chen's professional bias without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single deepening—Chen realizing the fortune applies to himself—forecloses his old identity with visceral cost ("tuning his ribs"). Agency in orchestrating disappearance drives escalation under accumulative lens, with the horn's "last orders" tightening temporal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "open secrets" as operational method (fortunes becoming true) and closure image (lighthouse "confessing light to no one"). Final submerged spine humming reweights the rock motif without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("white explosions like negatives developing") modulates rhythm under pressure—departure sequence uses short clauses for urgency. Keeper's dialogue ("Cheerful as ever") contrasts Chen's poetic lexicon without convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minimal artifacts: "accidentally prophetic" repetition serves motif accumulation but slightly muddles peak beats. High density throughout ("pulse syncing with turning beam" does triple duty), though "familiar enigma" risks thematic overstatement without concrete grounding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spy craft and poetic prophecy via lighthouse-as-darkroom. Risk-taking in accumulative structure pays off through the lithophone reconfiguration, avoiding derivative tropes through specific details like microdot specs as wire spectacles.</comment>
