<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear motivation as last Keeper Line member but "wisely adventurous" label lacks embodied contradiction; final choice earned yet interiority remains abstract during pressure beats like paint peeling. No secondary characters to test relationship dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost ("weight of history"), Hybrid lens (Causal/Accumulative) holds through sunrise deadline tightening. Quantum key feels unprepared but doesn't break causality; waterfall shift complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ruby flakes function as micro-setting constraining choices (mapping, reconstitution) and charging the crown's final image. Sensory specificity avoids white-room syndrome—"peeled like old skin" grounds decay while bioluminescent fruit reveals genetic lore.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sunrise deadline creates coherent pressure narrowing options (waterfall pattern shift), but stakes lack visceral personal cost until climax. Agency drives escalation through paint peeling and neural interface, though abstract "responsibility" dilutes trade-off intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through murals' truth versus propaganda without moralizing; throne's reconfiguration from "empty" to "expectant" offers non-literal answer. Avoids thematic echo but "wisely adventurous" label slightly undermines earned complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in historical layering ("geological strata" of paint) and tech integration; rhythmic control tightens under pressure ("She stepped onto the first glowing tread"). Minor register drift in "futuristic nostalgia" phrase.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "prismatic light like frozen blood" achieves triple duty (image/symbol/plot). Final line's "beautiful absurdity" crystallizes theme without sentimentality. Information density remains high even during lyrical orchard description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tech-magic through concrete details (plasma torch revealing murals, quantum key). Avoids trope safety via emotional specificity—throne as responsibility not power. Transformation test passed: generic "artifact" would break reconstitution logic.</comment>
