<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vela's interiority blends embodied mechanics (brass fingers flexing) with intellectual tension, but Caelus's motivation lacks equal depth. Micro-choices like tracing shadows with the needle card reveal hierarchy of values, though "chaos of unsolved paradox" leans abstract. Final handshake earns credible endurance with visible cost (exposed scar).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: stepping into the brook crystallizes options with undeniable cost (Caelus's scar exposure). Accumulative lens holds through density escalation—shadow alignment to spiral revelation—but "hesitation is the brook" slightly over-explains the stake reweighting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Brook and sundial constrain choices: shadow angles dictate Vela's counter-arguments, water reflection triggers the resolution. Final image ("water curling like a question answered") charges closure with environmental specificity, meeting 9+ gate via tool-as-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Vela's agency: her "overture as unheard" question forces Caelus's faltering. Conceptual cost (voice scar, dissolved atrium) is unmistakable, though the duel's intellectual escalation risks abstractness without the brook's physical grounding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the spiral motif's evolution—from hidden code to walked path. Final image ("departure lounge for destinations that moved with the asker") reweights the central question without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vela's perceptual signature shines in gear-hum rhythms and angle-based noticing, but "rawly" in Caelus's speech slightly flattens voice distinction. Psychic distance shifts intentionally during the vocoder stutter, maintaining pressure under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "fractured light" and "gear-hum" achieve high density. Minor rhythm hiccup in "migratory logic" treatise reference disrupts propulsion, but final line's "soft prick of needle through fabric" delivers resonant closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Synthesis of mechanical philosophy and brook imagery feels fresh, yet "diplomatically fierce" edges toward trope. Risk-taking in duel-as-overture heightens stakes coherently, though the glass atrium's dissolution slightly over-clarifies the metaphor.</comment>
