<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("sunwashed dread" vs quiet drive) manifests in micro-choices like cracking the note amid terror; embodied emotion ("pulse hammered against coral collar") avoids labels. Final renunciation of old mission earns cost through childhood obsession payoff. Slight deduction for "quietly driven" bordering on tell, but redeemed by action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is flawless Conceptual Repricing: gate's purpose reweighted from exclusion to protection with legible cost ("new, terrible chart"). Accumulative lens holds as pattern density escalates to the harmonic crack triggering city movement. Orientation anchors by line 3; no causality breaks. Tremor-mother's log match perfectly sets up causal escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (spiral-shell atlas) constrains choice when comparing tremor rhythms and charges closure as watchers' slits mirror its grooves. Final image ("sunwashed dread... new chart") recharges the carapace setting with cost. Sensory specificity ("harmonics that tasted of iron") avoids checklist. Only deduction: "salt-crusted abyss" slightly generic but redeemed by thematic integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize early: failure = city tumbles into Crack. Escalation driven solely by protagonist's agency—cracking the note then looping seven times—narrowing options as turtles veer north. Cost unmistakable in merchants' screams and the "terrible chart" altering future tactics. No coincidence; pressure tightens through her choices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through action: gate closure reweighted from barrier to protection via the watchers' crack revealing the expedition. Final image ("guide future wanderers... toward the crack") offers resonant answer without moralizing. "Here Be Answers" map label evolves meaning perfectly. Avoids thematic echo; complexity in "terrible chart" balances truth's burden.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("sunwashed dread," "tasted of iron") reflects cartographer's sensory expertise. Rhythmic control shifts from lyrical ("notes fluttered out") to staccato ("The watchers stirred") under pressure. Zero filter verbs; syntax compresses during climax ("She blew... altered... frayed"). "Quietly driven" slightly template-like but offset by embodied specificity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; every line advances atmosphere or plot ("dread pooled beneath them" charges momentum). Figurative language purposeful: "tasted of iron" conveys harmonic dissonance without muddle. Final line recharges "sunwashed dread" with new meaning. Minor deduction for "quietly driven" appearing twice, but closure beat pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms tropes: turtle-city cartography meets pattern-language communication. Emotional truth in parental sacrifice ("gate closed to keep children from following"). Specificity ("oxidized metal" watchers, spiral atlas) avoids generic fantasy. Risk-taking with Conceptual Repricing closure heightens stakes coherently; "terrible chart" embodies earned complexity.</comment>
