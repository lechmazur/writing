<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices: "cracking" the note despite dread, pulse against coral collar revealing obsession vs duty. Motivation rooted in childhood memory of gate closing, intensified to compel higher stakes. Final renunciation of safe ignorance earns visible cost in "terrible chart."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orientation achieved by line 3 (who/where/when), causal lens holds throughout. Closure lands as Charged Poise: city turning toward abyss with "new, terrible chart" crystallizes options and conceptual cost—knowledge of gate's true purpose reconfigures the entire premise with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Turtle shells function as micro-setting constraining every choice: tremor felt in spine, atlas made of shells, city movement dependent on carapaces. Final image charges the shell-atlas as it "resolves into" the watchers' faces, making environment indispensable to closure's conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (avoiding Crack abyss) signaled early. Meaningful tightening occurs when she cracks the note—agency-driven choice narrowing options from ritual to active questioning. Visible cost manifests in city's altered course and merchants' screams, charging the final image under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: the "terrible chart" guiding toward the crack reweights "Here Be Answers" without moralizing. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer—gate closed to protect children from horizon-chasers—through bioluminescent ink and sealed crack, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dread pooled beneath notes," harmonics "tasted of iron") reflects cartographer's professional bias. Rhythmic control under pressure: staccato "three short, one long" versus flowing descriptions. No head-hopping; free indirect style clean as "tide carving continents" embodies her worldview.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold—every line advances story/atmosphere. High density: "tremor travel up her spine like a warning spelled in Morse" fuses sensory detail, metaphor, and plot. Final line recharges "sunwashed dread" with new meaning without figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis: turtle-shell city isn't novelty but essential premise (movement risks Crack). "Pattern languages" transforms communication tropes through specific mechanics (cracked note, seven loops). Gate's true purpose reframes conflict non-obviously, with risk-taking heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
