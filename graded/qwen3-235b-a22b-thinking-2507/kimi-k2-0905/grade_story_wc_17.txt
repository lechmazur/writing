<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (scientific pursuit vs. ancestral pull) act simultaneously; final erasure earned by diary warnings. Slight tell in realization moment prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing flawless: "empty room that somehow breathed" reweights premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens held without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage actively constrains choices as "shutter" and charges final image ("layer of ivy over her own forgetting"). Environment shapes final tactics irreversibly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Mira understands building is a camera—foreclosing escape path. Escalation driven by agency (touching negatives) with unmistakable cost ("turning her into a corridor").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image ("empty room that somehow breathed") answers "what walls dream" without moralizing. Theme emerges through charged particulars, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("sensitively perceptive ears") filters all description; rhythmic compression during transformation ("sound collapsed; her heartbeat became the echo") heightens pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; every line multiplies purpose ("dripping corridors as developing trays" ties setting/theme/concept). Final image crystallizes theme without abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms "haunted building" via camera mechanics; "climate-shift storms as flash powder" synthesizes climate fiction with photographic metaphor organically.</comment>
