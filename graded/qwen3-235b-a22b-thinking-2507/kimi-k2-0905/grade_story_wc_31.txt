<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Jin’s interior contradiction (duty vs. quest) drives micro-choices like diving despite collapsing-archive risk, but the vanishing woman lacks secondary pressure development. Her salt-stained uniform hints at backstory but doesn’t concretely alter Jin’s tactics beyond initial motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands via Conceptual Repricing: the final image of colored lights "singing" reweights sound-as-light with felt cost (Jin’s transformation), under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation debt waived—the "meteor hush" disorientation pays off in the closing sensory shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The hotel key tag constrains choice (diving with cold brass throat) and charges the final image (lights burning in tints). Micro-setting mastery: air pockets dictate breathing tactics, and plankton becomes the literal "color of sound" that alters Jin’s perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through density—lanterns to plankton to colored vows—with the archive’s fragility imposing visceral cost (one exhale collapses it). But the dominant stake ("color of sound") remains slightly abstract; survival urgency could sharpen the trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the drowned library’s physics: vows as bioluminescent light reweights "sound" without moralizing. The final line ("sailors swore the pier lights sang... colors they could almost hear") is the resonant answer to Jin’s quest, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Jin’s perceptual signature shines ("hiss of kerosene meeting wick," "petals still whispering"), but "meteor hush" repetition risks template cadence. Voice modulates perfectly under pressure—dive sequence compresses syntax without losing immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffolding; "pressed lily drifted out, its petals still whispering" has one borderline overwritten phrase, but propulsion remains relentless. Final line’s syntactic shift ("burned with a different tint") crystallizes closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "drowned library" trope through specific physics (air pockets, plankton bioluminescence). The "vows as light" synthesis feels inevitable, with risk-taking (Accumulative lens) heightening stakes—no safety-middle hedging.</comment>
