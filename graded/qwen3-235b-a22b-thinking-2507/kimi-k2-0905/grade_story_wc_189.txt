<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied details ("laughter that was half sob," "grit of salt on lips") avoiding therapy-speak; daughter’s arc slightly thin but micro-choices like thumb brushing cicada wings earn reconciliation’s cost within scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "time would feel sharp, but it’s more like silt, layering" crystallizes stance with felt cost; Accumulative lens holds through tidal rhythm, though cicada’s "stored song" edges toward thematic over-explanation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto setting actively constrains choices (observing brittle star to avoid direct talk) and charges finale—"grit of salt on lips" embodies time’s texture, fulfilling micro-setting gate for 9+ band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the daughter’s arrival and cicada transfer under Accumulative lens; "silt, layering" insight delivers unmistakable cost, though escalation lacks one deeper pressure point for 9.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "silt" metaphor and tidal dialogue, avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "texture of time" with earned ambiguity, though "cocoon" risks slight thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable ("anemone folded like tiny green heart" as professional habit); rhythm mirrors tidal motion, with "advancing, retreating" cadence heightening pressure without artifacts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "water dripped... each drop a syllable" achieves high density. "Faint vibration" of cicada is borderline purple but saved by context—only hairline slip preventing 9.8.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms reconciliation trope via marine biology lens; "time as silt" is fresh, emotionally specific synthesis. Avoids middle-ground hedging but lacks one bold structural risk for 9.2+.</comment>
