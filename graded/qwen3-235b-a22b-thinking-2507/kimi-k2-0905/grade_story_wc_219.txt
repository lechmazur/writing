<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "luminous skeptic" drives choices, but emotional progression lacks visceral embodiment during high-stakes realization; "chemistry of homecoming" motivation remains abstract despite concrete actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with conceptual cost ("artificial belonging"), but causal linkage weakens in Accumulative lens; "bronze quiet" Earned Stasis lacks tangible consequence beyond internal resolve.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting (fly amber, bronze statues) constrains choices and charges closure; "bronze quiet" evolves from atmospheric detail to embodied cost in final image with perfect sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (human autonomy vs. harvested longing) tightens through Mara's discoveries, but escalation lacks visible price—visitor threat remains conceptual rather than altering tactics with concrete loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "chemistry of homecoming" motif without moralizing; final image reweights longing as resistance, though cost feels intellectualized versus visceral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("luminous skeptic" lexicon) modulates under pressure, but repetitive "academically rebellious" phrasing and filter verbs dilute immediacy in critical discovery beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops in climax, but paraphrase redundancy ("bronze quiet" recurrence) and elevated diction in "synthesis this feeling" passage disrupt POV plausibility during high-pressure analysis.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alien contact trope through "harvested homecoming" concept; emotional specificity in scientific investigation avoids cliché, though "fly amber" leans slightly derivative.</comment>
