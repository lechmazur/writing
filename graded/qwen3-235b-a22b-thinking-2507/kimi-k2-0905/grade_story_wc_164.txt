<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority excels via embodied emotion ("gloom felt cheerful") and micro-choices (conjecturing the path retracted), but "pang of abandonment" edges toward diagnostic label-speak, narrowly avoiding Q1's -0.6 penalty threshold.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lira's realization ("paths disappear only when no one walks them with wonder") reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost (the cliff's golden abandonment pang), validated under the accumulative/textural lens through the mosaic's transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The geode cave functions as active micro-setting—seeds bloom footsteps there, ash spells "remember," and the mosaic creates the new path—constraining every choice and charging the final image (chiming crater glass in pocket).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via Lira's agency: her conjecture ("maybe it needs a new story") drives the mosaic arrangement, narrowing options from recovery to creation, with felt cost in the cliff's golden pang and sealed cave.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the starfish boy's memory and cliff's loneliness, culminating in the earned insight about walking "with wonder"—no moralizing, only resonant action (planting seeds for future "cheerful glooms").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("doubt bruised indigo," seeds "clattered like tiny bells") and rhythmic control under pressure ("her sea-foam robes trailing memories like foam trails boats") showcase voice mastery with zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("ash that spelled a single word—'remember'") with clear propulsion, though "pang of abandonment" slightly muddles figurative clarity in a peak beat, costing 0.1.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "lost path" tropes via geological emotion and migratory seeds; the sea-foam recollectionist role synthesizes memory with tangible action (glass shards → new path), avoiding derivative safety with bold, coherent risk-taking.</comment>
