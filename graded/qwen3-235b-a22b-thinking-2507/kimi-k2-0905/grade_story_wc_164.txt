<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation for "why paths disappear" remains abstract without concrete stakes; interiority shows embodied emotion but lacks contradictory impulses during pivotal choices like surrendering memory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis succeeds with visible cost ("her missing pieces had become bridges"), but the migrating bird's final seed resolution slightly undermines Accumulative lens coherence at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crater glass as micro-setting constrains every choice and charges the climax ("cracked along emotional fault lines"), though shoreline details lack equivalent pressure in later beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("why paths disappear") without concrete consequences; pressure accumulates texturally but lacks narrowing options or tactical trade-offs beyond emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through crystalline seeds becoming "bridges," with final foam paths reconfiguring the premise without moralizing; avoids thematic echo in sand message's washaway.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("transliteration of emotions ripple like half-remembered songs"), but "bittersweet knowledge" in bird's eyes risks POV leakage beyond character-bound observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; metaphors maintain coherence ("mist of crystallized memories"), though "cheerful gloom" slightly overwrites in two high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms memory-keeper trope through crystalline specificity; "emotional residue coating every surface" feels fresh, with cost (surrendered memory) fully integrated into premise.</comment>
