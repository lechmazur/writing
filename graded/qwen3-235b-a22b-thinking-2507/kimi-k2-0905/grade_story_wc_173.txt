<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction lacks concrete manifestation; "chaste courtesan" motivation remains abstract despite strong embodied moments like blood answering in iambs. Final renunciation of the cloak feels earned but prior micro-choices under pressure lack contradictory impulses in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: snow retreat, mercury tears, and echo-weaving tighten pressure toward Charged Poise closure where freedom's cost ("terrifying lullaby") crystallizes meaning. Orientation clear by word 20; cost legible in "alarming serenity" reprise at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Silver courtyard evolves from frozen prison to blooming garden, directly constraining Lys' barefoot journey and charging the final image where blood/dew prints spell the new poem. Micro-setting (mosaic tiles revealing predecessors) forces critical choices during knot-undoing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through sensory deepening (snow hissing, mercury tears) not causal turns, perfectly valid for Accumulative lens. But "eternal obedience" remains abstract until echoes scatter; cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally embodied in the city's awakening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "bodily poetic" reframing: the final image of mercury tears as orbiting stars answers "what is freedom?" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite "alarming serenity" repetition, reweighting the opening lullaby with iron/lilac cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("anatomical verse," "crystalline threads that hummed") shines under pressure. But "bodily poetic" label recurs as abstract concept rather than character-particular observation, slightly diluting voice coherence during high-stakes weaving.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor template cadence ("The pouch stirred; The courtyard snow...") and three adjacent "The" openings in knot-undoing sequence trigger -0.4 deduction. Otherwise exemplary propulsion with zero loops; "veins of silver... anatomical verse" shows textural density without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Synthesizes courtesan tropes with visceral memory-harvesting in fresh, inevitable ways. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes, but "chaste by choice" transformation lacks grounding in prior struggle, slightly undercutting emotional specificity.</comment>
