<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lys’s embodied choices under pressure (palming silver veins, declining escape) reveal contradictory impulses—duty vs. liberation—with visceral cost in the contract’s ash. Mad weaver’s underdevelopment slightly weakens secondary pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final "alarming serenity" crystallizes freedom’s cost ("taste their own pulse") under Accumulative lens. Orientation anchors (silver courtyard/snow) by line 15; mosaic backstory tightens pressure without disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Silver courtyard evolves from frozen prison to blooming garden, constraining all action (snow retreat revealing tiles, thawing prints spelling poems). Final image’s "raw serenity" charges closure through tactile specificity (blood/dew, pulse-tasting).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defying lullaby) tightens via echo-weaving’s escalating cost (stone eyes weeping mercury). Agency-driven escalation culminates in the mirror-step’s conceptual cost—freedom as terror—but secondary stake (contract vs. self) lacks deeper interweaving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through embodied particulars: "chaste by choice" redefines freedom, while mercury tears becoming stars rejects tidy morals. Final image’s pulse-tasting offers resonant, non-literal answer to conformity vs. awakening without explicit moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("snow like lace veils," "pelvic-bone chord") with rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulates perfectly from hushed tension to liberated song; "alarming serenity" refrain earns its repetition through closure reweighting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; phrases like "spring water reflected starlight like shattered mirrors" achieve high density. Slight over-reliance on "alarming serenity" risks cadence monotony, but motif’s closure payoff justifies recurrence without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms courtesan trope through "harvest of echoes" as tactile rebellion. "Bodily poetic" redefines anatomy as liberation code; specificity (cereus blooming to "music betrayed silence") avoids abstraction while synthesizing freedom’s terror/beauty.</comment>
