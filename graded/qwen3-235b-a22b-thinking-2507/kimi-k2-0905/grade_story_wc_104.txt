<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her patient strategy versus urgent need to act; embodied emotion in "tasting cellophane and dust" avoids therapy-speak. Micro-choice to scatter seeds while sirens approach reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: footprints spelling the minor seventh chord crystallizes options with conceptual cost (regime reclaims ground but seeds outlast). Accumulative lens holds—pressure tightens through sensory density as artillery nears, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Carnival setting actively constrains choices: prize redemption netting traps guards, dry soil enables vault location. Final image of mirrors reflecting the arrow’s flight charges closure by reweighting "liberation" through micro-setting specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>One dominant stake (secure vault before wall falls) tightens through the "first groan of concrete" live clock. Her impede choice—dancing guards backward without gunfire—creates authentic tension with visible cost: delaying escape while sirens converge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: vacuum-sealed seeds as "tiny carnival lights," not abstract moralizing. Final line reweights resilience via "counting measures until harvest," avoiding thematic echo while charging prior material with staggering grace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: notices "soil stayed dry" for seed viability, not decorative decay. Under stress, syntax compresses ("Boots scuffed beyond the buckled door") while maintaining distinct rhythm that heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cellophane flashed like a spinning ride" does triple duty (action, setting, theme). Figurative language serves pressure: wall falling "like a bass drum striking midnight" ties destruction to carnival rhythm without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms rebellion tropes via seed-vault specificity: "children who never tasted cotton candy might still taste bread" grounds resilience in visceral stakes. Risk-taking (carnival as resistance theater) heightens coherence without gimmickry, though premise edges near familiar archetypes.</comment>
