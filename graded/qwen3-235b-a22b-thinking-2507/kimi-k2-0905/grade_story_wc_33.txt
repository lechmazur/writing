<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied choices: "absences pressed against his ribs," scooping coins "like collected apologies." Contradictory impulses (rebellion vs respect) drive key turns. Flaw integration slightly late; brother's postcard lacks sufficient friction before climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "route would close at dawn" crystallizes cost while "letters lifting like startled birds" reconfigures meaning. Accumulative lens holds throughout; orientation anchored by "day’s lone mail drop" within 50 words. Cost proof: "traded weather for words" makes conceptual price undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cobalt arcade functions as micro-setting that constrains choices: welded coin slot forces soda machine gambit, tokens spell routes. Recurring thunderstorm bottle charges final image ("regrowing itself drop by drop"). Environment actively shapes tactics—no white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (delivering eaten letters) tightens through Riven’s agency: uncorking storm, feeding coins to broken machine. Cost is visceral—"route would close at dawn"—and conceptual ("promises classified as contraband"). Drone pressure escalates stakes without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: tokens spelling routes, letters lifting "like startled birds." Final image ("hush between sending and receiving") reweights premise without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality via concrete details like "dry envelope waiting at sunrise" carrying emotional weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: mailman notices "copper wire and wax," "frayed patch." Syntax modulates under pressure ("He carried no letters today—only a thunderstorm in a bottle"). Zero head-hopping; interiority stays embodied ("throat tightened") without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "sloshing violet against the glass" does triple duty (sensory, tension, character). Zero loops or scaffold; final line’s "heartbeat of promises" recharges "brittle hush" with earned hope. Minor deduction for "sloshing violet" slightly generic color description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specificity: "disputed territory mailman" intercepts eaten letters, arcade tokens spell sewer routes. Avoids derivative pitfalls via concrete mechanics (trading storm for letters). Emotional truth in "collected apologies" outweighs surface novelty.</comment>
