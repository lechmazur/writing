<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "respectfully rebellious" duality and storm-bottle tension, but "foster a plan" summary slightly flattens the pivotal linking-absences motivation versus embodied choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as perfect Charged Poise—the dying arcade lights and council clerks' tremor crystallize the cost of broken promises without mechanical resolution, under a flawless Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The cobalt arcade actively constrains choices (neon saints masking EM noise, pinball machine hiding place), with twilight’s "bruised violet" evolution charging the final storm image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when drones pivot toward the storm, but the conceptual cost to the council lacks visceral on-page weight compared to the protagonist’s physical risk during delivery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment><comment>The blue heron motif evolves from chalk drawing to data-dot virus, offering a resonant non-literal answer to "where broken promises heal" without moralizing in the final rain-soaked image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("hot solder and colder regrets") and rhythmic control excel, though "respectfully rebellious" appears twice as a label rather than earned through action under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops and high density ("cumulonimbus claws scratching to escape"), but "brittle hush" to "anxious confetti" transition slightly overwrites the drone descent’s immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms dystopian tropes via "linking absences" method and bottled storm as atmospheric weapon; emotional specificity in Sal’s greeting avoids generic rebellion templates.</comment>
