<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Vey’s "iron boredom" versus compulsion toward the amulet, but mortal technicians lack distinct flaws beyond collective mutiny; their leader’s aurora eyes remain symbolic rather than driving concrete choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Vey’s "proceed" choice reconfigures immortality’s meaning with visceral cost as time "peels away," while the amulet’s transfer to mortals crystallizes stakes under Accumulative/Textural lens through sensory density escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—glass reflecting futures constrains Vey’s choices early, and solar plasma’s "vermilion" walls directly enable the dimensional anchor failure that forces the door’s appearance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency when Vey weaponizes his exile ("I am already exiled in endless time") to redirect mutiny toward the door, but the amulet’s "polar hunger" mechanic lacks visible tradeoffs beyond initial compulsion, muting escalation depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the amulet’s "goodbye" refrain reweighted by Vey’s final choice, avoiding moralizing; however, the "darkness that even immortality feared" risks pseudo-profundity without sufficient prior grounding in concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable—"glass that reflected futures where he had already arrived" embodies Vey’s temporal dislocation, and voice modulates from "bored immortal" lethargy to static-riding urgency without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion falters slightly in "centuries cracking like ice" (cliché amid otherwise fresh imagery), but "solar ions braided through the lattice" demonstrates masterful density; no closure-dulling artifacts despite lyrical intensity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "immortal ennui" trope through spatial mutiny mechanics and amulet’s "direction not death" curse, with the wooden door’s mundane terror offering a non-obvious emotional resolution that synthesizes cosmic scale with intimate stakes.</comment>
