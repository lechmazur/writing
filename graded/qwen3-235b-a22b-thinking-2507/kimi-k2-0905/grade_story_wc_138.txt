<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vey’s immortality-as-boredom is embodied through concrete sensory details ("watched civilizations bloom like sandcastles"), and his final choice to "proceed" into darkness earns emotional weight through centuries of accumulated longing. Mortal technicians lack interiority beyond plot function, weakening secondary pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a potent Charged Poise: Vey’s step through the door crystallizes irreversible finality ("door vanished, leaving the corridor brighter yet somehow emptier") with undeniable conceptual cost. Solar storm’s timing lacks tactical pressure, slightly diluting escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite constrains choice through magnetic corridors and solar-flare-lit glass that "reflected futures"; the wooden door’s "taste of finality" charges the closure image. Micro-setting (amulet fragment) directly shapes the climax’s magnetic reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the solar storm’s anchor failure, forcing Vey’s choice between exile and discovery. The mutiny subplot doesn’t sufficiently narrow options—Vey’s path feels inevitable rather than hard-won under pressure, softening the cost’s impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "after goodbye" reweighted by Vey’s step into unruled darkness, avoiding moralizing. Amulet’s "polar hunger" slightly over-explains the compulsion, nudging toward thematic echo without full integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vey’s voice carries distinct perceptual bias ("dimensionally aware enough to feel the word bend space"), with rhythmic control tightening during the mutiny. Technicians’ dialogue converges unnaturally into identical mutiny whispers, flattening voice distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Centuries cracking like ice" creates a mixed metaphor; "hush" repetition ("hush between thunder," "hush thickened") borders on synonym churn. Propulsion remains sharp, but these hairline slips prevent 9.0 despite otherwise vivid, job-doing prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms immortality tropes through spatial mutiny and magnetic compulsion; the "wooden door in cosmic escondite" offers fresh specificity. Slightly derivative in mortal-immortal power dynamics, though amulet’s "direction not death" twist elevates risk-taking.</comment>
