<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in tactile details (cracking voice, copper goggles) and micro-choices (feather harvest timing); contradictory impulses (scientific precision vs. emotional urgency) drive the climax without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as pollen disperses—cost of "centuries of grief" legible in the withering tendril and daughter’s implied salvation; Accumulative/Textural lens holds via moonset deadline tightening pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vine tendril constrains every choice (timing, song sequence); final image of new tendrils "spiral[ing] toward golden ratio" charges closure by mirroring Elara’s restored hope through setting evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Harvest moon’s descent creates relentless temporal pressure; stakes deepen as bloom withers during song, forcing Elara’s final micro-choice (pollen release at moonset) with visceral cost in "life force transferring to pollen".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges through pollen’s "revelation" rather than moralizing; final image reweights "sacred practices" as "sophisticated systems" via dispersing particles, avoiding thematic echo despite near-miss with abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in bioluminescent "runes" and "suspended constellations"; voice modulates from "cracking" song to resonant harmony with the arbor, avoiding uniform stress-tics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; "liquid fire" moon description risks ornamental density but earns payoff in pollen’s "captured starlight" reprise—figurative language serves momentum through the golden ratio motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "magical cure" trope via mnemonic remedy mechanics; "golden stories" as living memories reframes crop rotation as sacred science, avoiding derivative eco-fantasy through specific agricultural details.</comment>
