<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "voicing silence" as embodied action; rail spike anchors micro-choices under pressure. Slight reflection block (23%) risks flattening stakes but meets BRR by tying to tidal memory. No diagnostic labels; flaw is near-perfect composure reducing vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara's silence transforms echo into "Stay" with visceral cost ("emotional colors draining like sunset"). Orientation anchors by word 15; accumulative lens holds through pattern breaks. Goddess' threat lacks full testing, preventing 9.5+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sound wave garden constrains every choice: sonic vines recoil from calm, reeds straighten post-closure. Rail spike functions as micro-setting charging final image ("beating like a second heart"). "Lavender reeds" slightly decorative but outweighed by tactile evolution from dissonance to "lullabies gentle enough for wild things."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via goddess' threat ("burn the garden silent"), narrowing options to silence-as-weapon. Cost legible in draining emotional hues and starfire-warmed spike. Escalation barely meets "meaningful tightening" requirement; spike solution edges toward convenience without sufficient prior constraint.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "divinity is not a catch but a conversation" crystallized by transformed echo. Final "net sewn of lullabies and teeth" reweights premise without moralizing. Avoids Thematic Echo despite "Stay" revelation; "watercolor repentance" slightly abstract but redeemed by concrete aftereffects.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless: "constellations lumber earthward like sleepwalkers" reflects Mara's precise, sensory focus. Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure ("Mara drew the spike and drove it into the loam"). Goddess' dialogue borders on thematic echo but saved by diegetic urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "zigzag of sonic vines" avoids mixed metaphor while advancing pressure. Sentences vary from staccato ("Mara felt the rail spike pulse") to lyrical ("humming a feral lullaby"). "Emotional colors" slightly anthropomorphizes but redeemed by indigo longing "dripping onto soil."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms mythic tropes through concrete mechanics: "voicing silence" as hunting method, rail spike as relic/conduit. "Sound wave garden" specificity avoids whimsy; "borrowed starfire" recontextualizes divinity. Spike solution risks deus ex machina but earned by coastal-line backstory.</comment>
