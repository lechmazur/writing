<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses during climax; "cry" demand prompts physical action but no visible internal conflict. Motivation is clear (net woven of silence), yet the pivotal moment lacks embodied struggle beyond the rail spike's tactile anchor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands cleanly: Mara's understanding that "divinity is not a catch but a conversation" forecloses her original quest with felt cost (drained emotional colors, transformed lullabies). Causal lens holds through spike-driven grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sound wave garden functions as essential micro-setting: sonic vines recoil from Mara's calm, footsteps bloom chords, and the rail spike splits the "sound bed." Environment directly constrains tactics (silence as weapon) and charges the final image ("spike beating like a second heart").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: goddess's ultimatum ("show me your cry or burn the garden silent") forces Mara's spike-driven grounding. Cost is visceral in "emotional colors draining like sunset" and the transformed lullabies, narrowing options to silence-as-weapon under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the rail spike's transformation ("like a tongue that learned a new language") and "Stay" echo reweight the opening quest into mutual conversation. Avoids moralizing; final image of "answered question that refuses to stop asking" crystallizes complexity without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is flawlessly controlled: sensory details filter through Mara's fisher perspective ("tideline," "reels," "net"). No head-hopping; even goddess dialogue reflects Mara's perception ("screamed them back as feral lullabies"). Lyrical compression ("zigzag of sonic vines") serves accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("constellations transliterating emotions visible as colored smoke"). Strategic telling ("iron remembering the moment it once pinned steel to earth") advances atmosphere. Only minor flaw: "feral lullaby" repetition lacks significant reweighting in final beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms mythic tropes through specific constraints: rail spike as relic, sound wave garden physics, goddess as "white fire." Avoids generic symbolism via concrete stakes ("burn the garden silent"). Emotional truth in Mara's silent endurance outweighs surface novelty.</comment>
