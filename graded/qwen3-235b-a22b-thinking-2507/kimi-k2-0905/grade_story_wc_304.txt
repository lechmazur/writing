<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "beauty as a shield against forgetting" versus oblivion swallowing her name; micro-choices like the sable wand of cut hair reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Final renunciation earned through seven years of pattern-harvesting, though slight passivity before realization slightly dilutes agency escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands immaculately: "one life surrendered to keep three hundred and forty-two sparks alive" crystallizes conceptual cost. Orientation anchors instantly; accumulative lens holds through density escalation. Minor tension in "threshold widened" transition prevents 10.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Skyborne grotto constrains every choice—time moving "like honey through a sieve" enables the ritual, ice orchids receive her dispersed particles. Emerald chip (recurring object) charges final image where it "shows a woman smiling as she dissolved." Micro-setting perfection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing sparks before oblivion) deepens through protagonist's agency: realizing the spark is her own narrows options to surrender. Cost—"one life surrendered"—unmistakable on the page. Accumulative escalation via pattern density reweights stakes flawlessly under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "paint lips on the deceased" to "become the river." Final line reweights premise with conceptual cost without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality via visceral stakes (sister’s laugh swallowed by oblivion), achieving resonant non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful: noticing "rigor mortis traced maps across cooling flesh" reflects her profession. Rhythmic control under pressure evident in "breath catch like a held note" compression. Slight repetition of "lucidly watchful" prevents 9.5+, but no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "crystal stalactites that dripped with starlight" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Rhythm varies naturally from "sheets of violet and gold" to staccato "She pressed the chip." Only microscopic echo: "radiant hush" description slightly mirrors later "particles of radiant hush."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>"Beautician mortician" transforms tropes through specific practice of "finding patterns in static." Emotional truth in preserving sparks while knowing oblivion wins avoids cliché. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes; "ferryman becomes the river" reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
