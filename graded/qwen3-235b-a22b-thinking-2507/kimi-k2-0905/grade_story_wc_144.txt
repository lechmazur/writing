<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority shines through embodied contradiction: urgency versus methodical repair, reliving her trauma to teach the drone. Her final choice to use the water barrel emerges from prior causality, with visible cost in her emotional labor during the quenching scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under causal lens—the drone’s successful launch crystallizes options with felt cost in Lira’s quiet endurance. Orientation anchors by 40 words, but the cost (emotional toll of reliving trauma) lacks a single on-page sentence to pin it for 9.0 eligibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The water barrel—a micro-setting object—constrains Lira’s final repair tactic and charges the closure image as the drone mirrors its ripples. Sensory hierarchy (light refraction over sight) reflects her blindness while driving action, avoiding symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via Lira’s agency: the anchor lift’s "seven minutes" tightens options meaningfully, forcing the water-barrel improvisation. Cost is unmistakable in her trembling hands translating panic into torque, reweighting the dominant stake through physical/emotional trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "decode feedback into direction" becomes the drone’s halting flight path reconfigured by water ripples. Final image of the looping drone offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, charging the premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (light as sound/touch) sustains blind POV without head-hopping. Col’s dialogue ("Copper bleeding into violet") carries subtext and pressure. Minor register drift in "lumen-veins flickering like a panic" slightly disrupts Lira’s lexicon under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "jagged rainbow" and "magnetic calm" achieve high density. Minor synonym churn ("hummingbird drone whose glass wings had cracked" / "broken wing") in opening beat prevents 9.0, but propulsion remains flawless through climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Blind artisan using water-refraction repair transforms trope through specific, grounded mechanics. Emotional truth in linking Lira’s trauma to the drone’s "Morse of fear" creates freshness; risk-taking (sensory inversion) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
