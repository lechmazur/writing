<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira’s blindness isn’t a label but a lived constraint shaping her refraction-based repair method; her "decode feedback into direction" motivation drives every micro-choice under pressure, culminating in the earned endurance of teaching the drone to mirror her calm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: the drone’s silver arc crystallizes reconfigured stakes (village saved/vulnerability exposed) with felt cost in Lira’s remembered infirmary terror; causal escalation tightens via silica patch → feedback loop crisis → water-ripple recalibration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The water drippers function as micro-setting that constrains choice (color reports guide repairs) and charges the final image (ripples teach balance); mist/steam evolve causally from atmosphere to sea breeze cutting through as the drone departs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lira’s agency: the anchor-lift deadline forces the silica patch, then the drone’s "Morse of fear" demands recalibration; cost is legible in Col’s "seven minutes" warning and the village’s seasonal wait.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: the drone’s final "map of refractive grooves" reweights "decode feedback into direction" into a non-literal answer about transforming chaos into balance, avoiding moralizing via the gratitude-humming wings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Lira’s perceptual signature—reading light through touch, hearing boiler hush as metronome—creates rhythmic control under pressure; Col’s dialogue ("Copper bleeding into violet") distinctively advances plot without ventriloquism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "jagged rainbow" and "magnetic calm" metaphors deepen causality without muddle; sentence rhythm accelerates ("She breathed the magnetic calm...") then breathes ("wings humming a note like gratitude") matching repair tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Blind artisan repairing drones via refraction transforms repair tropes; the water-ripple solution grows organically from Lira’s established method, avoiding gimmickry while heightening stakes through tactile specificity.</comment>
