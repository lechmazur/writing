<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "choosing to remain unread rather than falsely known," with embodied stakes in smudging chalk and pocketing the confession. Slight tell in the postcard backstory ("promising she would grow up...") lacks micro-choice anchoring, preventing 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: erasing the chalk map charges the final image. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—pressure tightens through chalk codes and drone's shadow eclipse, reconfiguring meaning via "the surrender of words to time."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Golden arcade constrains choice (dawn light timing, postal slot glow) and charges closure: "honeyed beams turning dust into tiny planets" mirrors her hesitation, while erasure of chalk codes directly alters the final image’s emotional weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: flipping the clipboard and writing the second letter narrow options under Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable—"erasing the map that might have led anyone to her center"—as the drone’s shadow forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the unsent letter hovering "forever between" reweights anonymity without moralizing. Avoids pitfalls via the chalk gateway’s barcode/daisy chain—a resonant, non-literal answer to "protection vs imprisonment" that lingers past the final line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in "dust mote into a tiny planet orbiting her hesitation," with rhythmic control shifting to staccato urgency at "minutes now, maybe seconds." Zero head-hopping; voice modulates seamlessly from lyrical to visceral under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "neon signs from the 2080s flickered like tired fireflies" compresses time, tone, and character age into one propulsive line. Only microscopic flaw: "carefully inventive" repeats slightly but earns it through motif evolution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms anonymity tropes via specific, lived details: sidewalk chalk codes and the barcode/daisy chain arch feel inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes—erasing the map charges closure without gimmickry, synthesizing universals through "torn pages" of pseudonyms.</comment>
