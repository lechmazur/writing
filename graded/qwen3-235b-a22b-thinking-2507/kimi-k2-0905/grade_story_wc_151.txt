<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("protected or imprisoned") embodied in smudged chalk codes; final renunciation of truth-telling earned through childhood flashback and physical erasure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost in "choosing to remain unread" and erased chalk spiral; Accumulative lens held through density of sensory pressure culminating in drone's eclipse-shadow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Chalk spiral functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (erasure as final action) and charges closure; "pseudonyms fluttering like torn pages" reweights prior material through recurring object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via live clock (drone's early arrival forcing immediate choice); cost crystallizes in kept confession and erased path, narrowing options to permanent limbo with "unsent letter waited for next dawn."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (barcode/daisy gateway) without moralizing; final hovering envelope reweights identity struggle as "permanently between" with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("dust mote into tiny planet orbiting her hesitation") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control shifts to staccato during drone arrival while maintaining consistent voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding; "lavender shadows on her face" demonstrates textural specificity; figurative language ("pseudonyms fluttering like torn pages") charges closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of obsolete mail system as identity metaphor; risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes through "chalk gateway" reconfiguration.</comment>
