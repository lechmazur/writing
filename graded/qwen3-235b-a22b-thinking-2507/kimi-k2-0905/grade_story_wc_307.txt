<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s aging-body/child-voice tension and her withholding of truth; micro-choice to drop the stone reveals hierarchy of values. Slight ambiguity in "hair silvering toward childhood" costs precision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands perfectly: "vanishing was simply the return to the hand" reweights spacetime with undeniable cost in her fading hands. Accumulative escalation via ripple rings tightens knowledge relentlessly under a coherent textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The magnetic grotto’s hum literally pulls iron in her blood, constraining her vanishing; the stone’s weight charges the final image. Environment isn’t backdrop but causal force—9+ gate cleared via constraint on closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by protagonist agency: Marcus’s patient watching narrows options until the fourth ring’s revelation. Cost is visceral in Elara’s vanishing hands, making stakes legible under the textural lens without a single causal misstep.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through action—the stone’s ripples physically manifest spacetime’s circularity. Final image ("vanishing was simply another way of appearing") offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, avoiding all thematic echo traps.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in Elara’s aging voice ("higher pitch of approaching adolescence" to "child’s"), with syntax tightening as she fades. Rhythmic control under pressure elevates tension without a single register mismatch or head-hop.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sycamore hush settled" propels atmosphere while foreshadowing disappearance. Closure beat ("vanishing was simply the return to the hand") crystallizes meaning with surgical precision—no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Backward aging trope transformed via magnetic grotto physics and ripple-based revelation. Emotional specificity in "knowing you would vanish was different from understanding" synthesizes the premise into inevitable, non-obvious truth without gimmickry.</comment>
