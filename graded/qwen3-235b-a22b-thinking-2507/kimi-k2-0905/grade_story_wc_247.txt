<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation ("translate silence into music") is clear but interiority remains abstract; no embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure beyond signing gestures. Final renunciation (leaving camera) lacks visible cost scaling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the lingering note teaches townspeople to "listen for what had been removed," reconfiguring silence with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds through density increase in sensory deletions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Luminous harbor actively constrains action (moonlight enabling phosphor trails, capstan for offering). Micro-setting (camera, saltwater) charges closure by "winding forward emptiness as song." Sensory hierarchy reflects liminal urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (silence as music) deepen via density increase: deleting sounds reweights sorrow as ballast. Agency in signing drives escalation, but cost remains diffuse; "joyful sorrow" lacks tangible forfeiture beyond emotional shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "silence waiting for permission" crystallized by the final image of people "rehearsing shapes." No moralizing; conceptual repricing reweights silence without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("moonlight painted silver ladders," "taste of rust") persists under pressure. Rhythmic control modulates from hush to symphony; no head-hopping despite multi-POV shards.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but "phosphor trail only visible where moonlight kissed salt" risks figurative muddle. High density maintained, though one elevated diction slip ("evaporated grief") in peak beat prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "silent hero" trope through harbor-specific mechanics (sailors' sign language, capstan offering). Risk-taking (non-causal structure) heightens stakes; "emptiness wound forward as song" feels inevitable.</comment>
