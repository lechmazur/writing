<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s silent crying to preserve composition, yet micro-choices lack simultaneous tension—her acceptance of erasure feels earned but not viscerally conflicted under pressure. The advisor’s pressure crystallizes stance, but internal struggle leans sequential rather than layered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: moon horizon crystallizes options with cost in "Elara cried without sound." Accumulative escalation holds—measured gaps deepen to harbor orchestra—but advisor’s dissolution risks convenience, narrowly avoiding causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Harbor constrains choices (splintered wood for palm press, halyard taps as quarter notes), but occupational detail (father’s ship names) lacks tactical impact. Vintage camera as micro-setting charges closure via "unexposed emulsion of now," meeting 9+ gate through specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by Elara’s agency: mapping gaps → conducting harbor. Cost unmistakable in soundless crying and empty camera. One tightening (disruption → full orchestration) suffices; advisor’s "first note" deepens stake without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions—camera clicks, mapped silences—not abstraction. Final image (hearing anthem in empty camera) offers resonant answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; "carving room for listening" is earned via scene pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: notices sensory gaps ("between gull cries"), weights silence. Rhythm modulates with pressure ("Water slapped hulls: steady eighths"). Minor flaw: "joyful sorrow" phrase slightly repetitive, but pattern taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "A cat yowled, a flag rope clinked" avoids loops, high density. One near-miss—"compound aroma she heard a chord" slightly mixed metaphor—but "minor, resolving" salvages clarity without dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "forgotten place" trope via specific mechanics (sign language, empty camera). Risk-taking (silence as negative space "glowing faintly") heightens stakes coherently. "Disruption is first note" reweights premise with emotional specificity.</comment>
