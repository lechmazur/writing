<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in embodied struggle (diaphragm pierced by rootlet), but contradictory impulses lack simultaneity; final renunciation earned yet internal conflict remains physicalized rather than psychological. "Fault circuits quiet" implies system struggle but misses deeper character-specific contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "4.7 grams of sorrow" quantifies emotional weight while "innocence... would return" crystallizes cyclical cost. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—density peaks as stone emerges, pressure coheres through "heavier" refrain to felt cost in log entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Botanical illustration functions as micro-setting that charges closure: smudged veins become topographic map, then wraps the stone. Snowfield footprints pool "auroral sorrow," directly constraining the expulsion act and final image. Body (diaphragm pierced) and tool (quilt/logbook) deepen tactile urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: smudging illustrations to "externalize the swallowed thing" directly escalates physical cost (rootlet piercing diaphragm). Cost is unmistakable—"4.7 grams of sorrow" materializes conceptual weight—but secondary pressure (failed shadows) lacks integration with dominant truth-weight stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "4.7 grams" reweights truth as measurable sorrow without moralizing. Final image (stone cooling like "small planet") resonates non-literally with "valley temporarily innocent," avoiding sentimentality while charging conceptual cost of protection’s weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines—"ceiling boards flexing like lungs," "breath blooming like shattered glass"—with rhythm modulating under pressure (short clauses during rootlet piercing). No head-hopping; "fault-tolerant" lexicon stays consistent, though "auroral sorrow" risks slight thematic echo without sufficient prior texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "mercury wept," "snow hissed" achieve high density. Minor deduction for "chlorophyll sorrow" in peak fever scene—elevated diction slightly clashes with physiological immediacy—but rhythm accelerates cleanly toward stone expulsion. Final line’s cadence deepens closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms oracle trope through meteorological specificity ("barograph’s trembling hairline," "anemometer counting heartbeats"). Risk-taking (no dialogue, pure interiority) heightens stakes coherently; "4.7 grams" synthesizes emotional truth with scientific precision, avoiding abstraction. Near-echo of seed motifs redeemed by visceral execution.</comment>
