<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "modestly fearless" remains label without visible tradeoffs. Emotional progression feels curated rather than layered through flaws, though embodied actions like scraping knees on lichen ground choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with cost ("laughter settle behind her ribs, a small sun learning how to shine without burning"), but harp's resolution feels coincidental rather than earned agency. Orientation clear within 120 words; lens holds as Accumulative/Textural.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Echo Gorge functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (river stones, harp placement) and charges final image (glowing footprints). "Luminous ache" evolves from sensation to closure motif, satisfying 9+ gate via recurring object charging the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensory escalation ("dripping giggle" to "colors no tongue could name"), but harp's role lacks causal necessity—it resolves the problem it didn't create. Agency partially undermined by external mechanics of the warped instrument.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: laughter as splintered healing, not abstract wisdom. Final image ("footprints glowing with luminous ache") reweights "spectral confessions" without moralizing, though "modestly fearless" label slightly tips into thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("throat of stone," "sour chords") with rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulates from hushed dawn to crystalline climax without head-hopping; lyric compression taught early and paid off in closure's resonant image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Figurative density risks overwriting in high-pressure beats ("luminous ache that traveled the wire... painting mist with colors no tongue could name"). Near-duplicate phrasing ("half-lived and half-dead") slightly dulls closure's propulsion despite otherwise vivid propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms soul-collector trope through specific mechanics (laughter splinters, crocodile tooth ritual). "Spectral confessions" reconfigured from threat to sleepy grins feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens emotional truth without gimmickry.</comment>
