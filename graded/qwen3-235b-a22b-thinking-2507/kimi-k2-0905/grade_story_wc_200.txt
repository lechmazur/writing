<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete ("knees scraping lichen") and micro-choices drive action, but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; "modestly fearless" remains label without visible flaw-driven cost. Final integration feels earned though.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the dissolved tooth/giggle fusion and "small sun learning how to shine" crystallize stakes with undeniable cost. Orientation anchors instantly; Accumulative lens holds through spectral confession accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Echo Gorge functions as active micro-setting—its spectral confessions constrain Elara’s tactics, while the crocodile’s tooth charges the final image. Sensory details ("blue with cold but eyes bright as sunrise on snow") filter through her professional lens flawlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (integrating fractured laughter) tightens via harp distortion, but escalation leans slightly on atmospheric pressure over protagonist agency; the snapped string provides visible cost, though the giggle’s surrender lacks tangible resistance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "laughter splinters" and dissolution imagery, but final lines ("room for more," "carry home") verge on thematic echo, nearly tipping into moralizing without full ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("giggle writhing like a minnow in air") and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulates perfectly from hushed dawn to luminous climax; elision of backstory taught early via concrete cues like the tooth’s pulse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "silver mirage of the child’s giggle" shows through image, not label. Minor deduction for "modestly fearless" abstraction in high-pressure beat, but density and cadence shifts ("river slowed to hear") serve Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms soul-collector trope via specific mechanics (gathering laughter fractures), with emotionally precise details like "sour chords that bent memories." Fresh synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, resisting generic templates.</comment>
