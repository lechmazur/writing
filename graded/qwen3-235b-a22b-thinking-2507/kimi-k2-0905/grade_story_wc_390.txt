<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mireya's "logically emotional" trait drives her pivotal third-path choice, not abstract labels; embodied contradiction peaks in the calculus scene where tears tasting of "salt, iron, and whale song" crystallize earned cost. No diagnostic speak, only concrete micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: worn key and dissolved shadows show cost, but marina's intact survival lacks felt consequence—shoulder the burden of her tears isn't sufficient escalation payoff for the stakes. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds consistently through vibrational resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina constrains every choice (calving ice forces the calculus) and charges closure via "ice remember[ing] mercy"; the crypt keeper's key evolves from tool to "sleeping child," its worn teeth embodying the cost. Final star-spiral reweights setting with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through sonic density (micro-shrieks to calving ice), but the shadow-resolution lacks setup—why would "hungry" entities suddenly heed the third path? Cost is legible in the key's transformation, yet the town's unscathed survival undercuts pressure's final tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "teaching darkness to listen" crystallizes in the choir of forgiven dead, while stars mirroring the Echo's spiral reweights the premise as "map of absolution." Zero moralizing; cost resonates in worn key teeth, not stated morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("ice remembered when it was glacier" reveals engineer/keeper mindset); rhythm modulates perfectly with pressure (short sentences during crisis). Slight abstraction in "logically emotional" compensated by concrete actions, but prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>Overwriting in "fleshly ethereal" slightly muddles sensory clarity during high-stakes bowing, and "warm blood, fleshly ethereal" risks mixed metaphor. Final paragraph's scaffold ("she would remain...") dents propulsion, though closure remains vivid.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sonic lighthouse engineering transforms tropes via whale-bone physics and vibrational ethics. Specific details (baleen bow, fossilized ear-bone) avoid generic fantasy; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry as sound becomes the central conflict engine.</comment>
