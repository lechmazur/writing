<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in embodied contradiction: "scintillatingly somber joy" manifests as "demure audacity," not abstract labels. Micro-choices like tracing the spiral without seeing it prove motivation through action under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant Charged Poise: her realization about "invisible acts sending ripples" reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost ("damp cloak" to "scintillatingly somber joy"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through pattern recognition, with cost legible in altered perspective.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The bamboo whisk constrains choice (kneeling to find it) and charges the final image (stored light in nets). Rain-slick stones and fireflies evolve causally, mirroring internal states through tactile action ("palms to them, feeling the slow heartbeat").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency: seeking the whisk evolves into understanding hidden labor’s ripple effects. Cost is visceral in the "damp cloak" of firefly season transforming into earned "scintillatingly somber joy" without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: the whisk’s "invisible labor" and "knot tightened in darkness" reconfigure meaning without moralizing. Final image of "moon paths" guiding fish/fishermen offers resonant non-literal answer to "hidden effort" premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in selective detail: "moon paths silvered the puddles," "fireflies blinked in code." Rhythmic control peaks in the spiral-walking sequence, with compression ("stepping sideways, then forward, then back") taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "silver drops" scattering demonstrates high information density. Minor register drift in "scintillatingly somber" (elevated for context) barely touches closure but avoids muddle. Final line’s "moon paths" recharges motif with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "hidden labor" trope through specific verifiable details: silk from "failed cocoons," grandmother’s "tiny moons" carving. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off via Charged Poise closure that feels inevitable through patterned details.</comment>
