<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (analytical vs artistic impulses), but "fear of color" epiphany lacks concrete anchoring in prior behavior; micro-choices like chest-punching reveal values under pressure yet some emotional progression feels summarized ("trembling certainty" repetition).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the observatory roof reconfiguration with ultramarine sigil and "mapping arrival" crystallizes stance with undeniable conceptual cost; Accumulative lens holds through memory-releasing beats without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cracks in pavement form a micro-setting that actively constrains choices (guiding movement, healing as confessions occur) and charges the final image where they "become mere sidewalk"; starlit vault evolves from external setting to internalized ceiling with purposeful specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency as each confession literally lights compartments and heals cracks; visible cost in dissolved punch and folded fortress, though the fortress's abrupt appearance slightly weakens escalation coherence in the pressure build.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "mapping escape routes vs arrival" with no moralizing; final image of blank canvas and sidewalk reconfigures silence/stakes non-literally while avoiding thematic echo—no character articulates the thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("analytically artistic mind" mapping cracks) and rhythmic control under pressure; "clacked once, notching the air" accelerates tension, though "trembling certainty" repetition slightly dilutes voice in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops except verbatim "cracks in pavement forming arrows" repetition (4x), which appears in the final paragraph—triggering Q7's final-third artifact penalty (-0.3); otherwise impeccable density and propulsion with no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mapping/art metaphors feels inevitable, but "fortress of unspoken truths" leans slightly tropey; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though one transformative beat ("fear of color") lacks groundwork.</comment>
