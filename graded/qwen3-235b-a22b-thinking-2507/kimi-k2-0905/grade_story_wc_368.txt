<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Hoshiko’s shift from collector to channel, but the epiphany edges toward over-tidiness; "valley-mist wonder" motif lacks embodied struggle in pivotal realization beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with conceptual cost in "disappear inside them" realization, reweighting the entire premise through the dissolving wing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The morpho wing as micro-setting constrains every choice—alignment with sun triggers visions, dissolution charges closure—proving environment needn’t be vast to shape tactics in this lyric scope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Hoshiko’s agency: heart’s pulse narrows options as visions escalate, culminating in the cost of surrendering ownership ("becoming channels rather than vessels") with undeniable conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete particulars ("indigo could hold both sky and ocean"), avoiding moralizing; the final silk/dye image resonates as a non-literal answer to story magnetism without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dye master’s perceptual signature ("pigments and patterns") controls rhythm and diction under pressure, though "valley-mist wonder" recurs with slight redundancy in high-stakes beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exquisite texture overall, but "quietly explosive" appears three times with diminishing returns; minor scaffold in reflection-led sections slightly dulls closure’s immediacy without breaking momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms "storyteller" trope through radical porosity concept; "iridescent caution" as tangible narrative physics feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking elevating coherence not gimmickry.</comment>
