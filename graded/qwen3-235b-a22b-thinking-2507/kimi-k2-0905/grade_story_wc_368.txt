<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Kael’s terror/tenderness vision, but the donor’s abstraction weakens motivation escalation; "borrowed heart accelerate" micro-choice earns closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands via "hollows in the world" insight with visceral cost ("pulse stumble, surge"); Accumulative lens holds through sun-trail tracking to final indigo knotting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: morpho wing constrains choices (sunlight runes, vision trigger) and charges closure as narrative-saturated lamp; "skein of indigo thread" payment shows lived-in use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from intellectual curiosity to embodied cost ("terror and tenderness") through Kael’s agency; sun-trail tracking narrows options with visible price in the bridge vision’s heart stumble.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "hollows" metaphor without moralizing; final image of palms "itching for color" reweights magnetism as active longing, avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dye-master perceptual signature ("cerulean to indigo," "indigo thread") creates distinct rhythm, but "valley breathed" anthropomorphism slightly drifts from embodied POV during high pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; "microscopic ridges split sunrise" exemplifies propulsion, though "soft collisions like distant applause" risks cliché in a pivotal beat without sufficient novelty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Risky Accumulative structure transforms heart-transplant trope through sun-trail mechanics and morpho physics; "hollows" synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh, avoiding derivative safety.</comment>
