<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation ("comprehension, not possession") drives every micro-choice under pressure, with embodied emotion (sensing "emotional hues" in silk threads) avoiding label-speak; her final palm-print on the wax earns renunciation through prior causality, though contradictory impulses could deepen slightly at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: merged clock hands pointing "inward" reconfigure time’s meaning with conceptual cost ("remembrance could never be weaponized"), and the Accumulative/Textural lens (density shift in sensory details) holds from frozen 11:11 to dawn’s recalibration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ceremonial rope—a micro-setting object—constrains Elara’s choices (weaving threads by emotional temperature) and charges the final image where it becomes a "luminous filament," transforming the tower from timekeeper to "measuring the distance between what was forgotten and what was forgiven."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara’s agency: deciphering the wax seal’s purpose narrows options to one irreplaceable act (weaving absences), with conceptual cost crystallized when the treaty’s return demands she become the archivist of "deferred remembrance," foreclosing passive observation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the fables of absence as actionable mechanics (stored absences, not erased), culminating in the final image’s non-literal answer: the tower now "measuring the distance between what was forgotten and what was forgiven" without moralizing, resisting tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines via archivist-specific noticing ("temperature changes in silk corresponding to emotional hues"), with rhythmic control under pressure ("threads loosening... like serpents charmed") and no head-hopping; "warmly methodical" repetition slightly borders on tic but serves voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("grief cooled to indigo, hope warmed to saffron") propels momentum without muddle, and the final line’s "dawn climbed the library’s spines" recharges the wax seal’s transformation with crystalline clarity, no artifacts near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes tropes (mystical clock tower) through grounded specifics: "fables of absence" as literal storage of unsigned treaties, with risk-taking (abstract concepts made tactile via silk threads) heightening stakes while maintaining emotional truth in the archivist’s burden.</comment>
