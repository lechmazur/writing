<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in embodied loss (lullaby memory vanishing "like a missing tooth"); contradictory impulses in "refusing grief" while trading her last honest memory. Slight underdevelopment of Cassidy's struggle with the con's morality weakens flaw integration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: memory erased as ink solidifies into tar, balanced by asylum grant. Hybrid lens (causal policy rewrite + textural "granite liquefy") holds through Rurik's retching climax. Cost proof evident in "tune vanish from her mind forever."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting (ink pot, bone saw) constrains the trade; funeral home tools (eyelid weights) pressure pacing choices. Final "wet pavement looked alive" charges closure by contrasting deathly setting with hard-won vitality. Meets Q3 9+ gate via object-as-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (asylum grant) tightens through Cassidy's agency: memory sacrifice directly liquefies policy. Cost is unmistakable (erased lullaby) and shapes tactics (blood-mailing document). Rurik's scribbling crystallizes stance under pressure without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete trade: "mathematics demands both sides lose something precious" embodied in memory-for-asylum exchange. Final blood-mailing offers resonant non-literal answer to "what memory equals a mother’s life?" avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature sharp ("grief she refused to feel," "tune vanish like a missing tooth"); voice modulates from rehearsed equations to visceral loss. Slight register drift in "refrigerated smile" edges toward cliché but saved by context.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; high density ("solidified into useless tar" conveys magic's cost in 4 words). "Brittle as old bone" risks cliché but earns payoff through Rurik's physical shattering. Final line’s "blood" intensifies without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: bureaucratic magic as political tool transforms asylum trope. "Deathly vitality" tone sustains through formaldehyde/lilacs and wet pavement. Avoids safety middle via morally ambiguous trade where both "win" through loss.</comment>
