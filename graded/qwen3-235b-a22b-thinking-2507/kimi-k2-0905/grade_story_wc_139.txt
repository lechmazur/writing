<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Interiority crystallizes through embodied choices: trading the lullaby memory for asylum rewrites "mathematics demands both sides lose something precious" with visceral cost. Contradictory impulses (grief vs mission) drive every micro-choice under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change with undeniable cost: "felt the tune vanish from her mind forever" while mailing the document in blood. Causal linkage holds flawlessly—Rurik's "granite" stance liquefies only through Cassidy's agency and sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The ink pot functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: solidified tar versus blood-addressed document. Prep room tools (bone saw, eyelid weights) constrain choices during pacing, avoiding symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven solely by Cassidy's agency: "dipped the antique nib" forces Rurik's policy rewrite. Cost is unmistakable in the lullaby's erasure, reweighting "what memory equals a mother’s life?" into visceral forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the blood-mailed document and vanished lullaby—a resonant answer to "mathematics of a fair trade" without moralizing. "Absence like a missing tooth" crystallizes cost through concrete particulars, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("stomach lurch," "tune vanish forever") modulates under pressure with rhythmic precision. Voice remains anchored in Cassidy's lexicon even during high-stakes dialogue, avoiding diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "granite policies into negotiable vapor" does triple duty as metaphor, world rule, and thematic engine. Final line "addressed in her own blood" recharges ink motif without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of political asylum with memory-based magic: transforming "fair trade" into lullaby-for-asylum calculus avoids tropes. Emotional truth in trading irreplaceable intimacy for bureaucratic justice heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
