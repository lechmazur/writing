<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (change past vs accept present) act in scene; micro-choice of offset footstep earns endurance with conceptual cost. Lacks visceral struggle in pivotal moment—refusal feels too serene for high-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: stepping back into twilight crystallizes stakes with undeniable cost ("perpetual twilight" as chosen burden). Orientation flawless; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through mosaic shards. Near-miss on cost proof: "icy warmth as companionship" slightly abstracts the price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Magnetic nexus functions as micro-setting that charges closure (ghost-touch reconfiguration), but station setting remains backdrop—fails to constrain choices beyond aviary module. Sensory detail vivid yet over-indexed on visual; "mechanically warm" lacks tactical pressure despite recurrence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes (becoming station's organ) tighten via moth-bats' song altering projections, forcing stance crystallization. Escalation driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens. Cost ("perpetual twilight") legible but not sufficiently felt—relies on conceptual weight over embodied consequence in final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "subdued awakenings" reweighted as chrysalis metaphor, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("slightly offset footstep") offers resonant answer to "time moves sideways" without stating moral. Achieves organic complexity: both futures "true" yet cost of inaction crystallized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("hush of beating wings," "air thickened into a prism"), but final paragraph's "proving sideways time not in equations" edges toward thematic statement. Rhythmic control impeccable under pressure; no head-hopping in mosaic shards.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("projections of older skies... languages now extinct" compresses history without clutter). Near-miss: "mechanically warm bellows" risks stock phrasing but saved by context. Final image’s propulsion flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synthesizes time-travel tropes through "subdued awakenings" and 3:5 pulse ratio—fresh inflection grounded in xenobiology. Emotional truth in choosing perpetual twilight over green-moon death. Risk-taking (mosaic shards) heightens stakes without gimmickry; transformation test passed.</comment>
