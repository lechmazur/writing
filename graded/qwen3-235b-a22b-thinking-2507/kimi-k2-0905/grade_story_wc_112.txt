<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (rewrite past vs. accept becoming) act simultaneously in the moth-bat interference scene; final renunciation of timeline alteration earns cost through offset footsteps, avoiding diagnostic labels despite high-concept premise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "mechanical lungs breathing with her instead of for her" crystallizes the stake shift; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through moth-bat interference patterns reconfiguring the nexus's meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting (magnetic nexus) constrains the pivotal choice to step sideways; its lattice of light charges the final image where "every possible choice glimmered like frost" directly enables the closure's thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation via protagonist agency as moth-bat song transforms projections into interference patterns; cost legible when "reluctant imago" realization forces renunciation of rewriting her past, narrowing options to acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "offset footsteps" as non-literal answer to time's sideways motion; avoids moralizing by making "proof" reside in embodied choice rather than equations, with chrysalis metaphor charging closure without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("grapefruit-sized sphere," "chilled honey" lever) reflects mechanic's tactile focus; rhythmic control under pressure in "three against five" pulse description maintains distinct voice during high-stakes time shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in closure beat; "icy warmth lingered... breathing with her instead of for her" achieves high density. Slight overwriting in "mechanically warm heartbeat/bellows" repetition prevents 8.7+ despite otherwise flawless propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of xenobiology ("subdued awakenings" as chrysalis signature) with quantum time theory; avoids trope pitfalls through specific moth-bat interference patterns that reconfigure stakes organically in the climax.</comment>
