<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction manifests in Mara's "theoretically rebellious but practically cautious" tension, crystallized when she jumps tracks. Final choice to burn the lantern earns cost via her throat "filled with clover melancholy" and refracted light replacing scrawls.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands via the burning spiral equation projecting her name + ∞—reconfiguring probability as forgiveness with conceptual cost ("refuse to admit she was chasing" her father's ghost made legible through action).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The cracked mica pane constrains choice (holds scrawls, projects spiral) and charges closure via morning light refracting four-leaf shapes. Rainwater’s role in revealing "traverse" inscription demonstrates environmental causality beyond postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mara's agency: interpreting wet ink ("traverse where index omits itself") drives her into the tunnel. Cost is visible in her "clover melancholy" realization that forgiveness requires facing probability's failures, narrowing her path from hunting contradictions to creating them.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: the lantern’s transition from holding scrawls to projecting "second chances" reweights "widen perspectives responsibly" as active forgiveness. Final image ("past is fixed" scrawl burning) offers non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature via probability lexicon ("stochastic anomalies," "count cards by dealer’s wrist tremor"). Voice modulates under pressure—lyric ("rainwashed library") compresses to fragmented urgency ("lantern swinging, following copper smell") as she enters the tunnel.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dice mid-roll" simile integrates momentum with theme. Near-miss: "lucid contradictions made flesh" risks abstraction but saved by static photo proof. Final line’s "four-leaf shapes across her palm" delivers crystalline propulsion without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms gambling tropes through probability professor’s lens: "burn the house down with its own matches" recontextualizes addiction as rebellion. Fresh inflection in subway scrawls as stochastic artifacts—specific to Mara’s academic grief, not generic mystery.</comment>
