<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mira’s refusal to see her father’s love beneath ruin; her micro-choice to annotate pages with "I see you seeing me" crystallizes earned change with embodied cost ("throat tight," trembling hands). No diagnostic label-speak mars the pivotal lantern epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: Mira’s scratched "For the next exception" and walking out "wider" reconfigures options with undeniable cost ("not lighter, but wider," lingering melancholy now guiding). Accumulative lens holds as scrawls deepen pressure toward stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Clover melancholy evolves from clinging scent to guiding force, charging the final image. Lantern’s mica pane actively constrains choices—fracturing light enables epiphany, scratched message shapes closure—meeting 9+ gate via micro-setting necessity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (reconciling with father’s legacy) tightens through Mira’s agency: interpreting scrawls forces subway ritual, diary entry crystallizes stance. Cost legible in "throat tight" and physical act of riding to line’s end; coincidence never resolves conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "I see you seeing me" annotations reweight contradictions without moralizing. Final image ("She bet on herself") offers resonant answer to "bet on the thing you refuse to see," avoiding Thematic Echo penalty via embodied closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in academic-poetic diction ("clover melancholy," "lattice of love beneath the ruin"); rhythmic control under pressure evident in fractured sentences during lantern epiphany. No head-hopping; compression taught early via "cryptic scrawls."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "rainwashed library" to "city rinsed clean" progression shows high density. Minor register drift in "lattice of love beneath the ruin" risks overwriting but pays off in closure. Final line achieves maximum resonance with minimal words.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms gambling tropes via "exceptions that prove chaos"; lantern-as-compass device feels fresh through emotional specificity. Risk-taking (lyric structure, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, meeting 9+ synthesis standard.</comment>
