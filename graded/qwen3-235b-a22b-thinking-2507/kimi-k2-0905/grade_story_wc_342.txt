<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids diagnostic labels through embodied constraints (shoulders carrying "invisible weight"), but the "limitation is not failure but filter" insight edges toward over-articulation in peak crisis, slightly flattening the earned transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost: the painted sky becomes a "map of human limitation" outlasting faces, its cost crystallized by the coin's doubled indentations amid demolition's physical and symbolic erasure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The coin functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—its transferred indentations creating "braille of stars" that literally constrain the painting method and become the story's enduring artifact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation through Accumulative/Textural lens succeeds via density increase (vibrations, candle flicker, siren countdown), but the demolition pressure narrows options only superficially; the core action (painting sky) lacks meaningful tactical adaptation beyond speed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the negative-space revelation, culminating in the final line's resonant, non-literal answer: identity anchoring in "absence" makes the sky's painted map "outlast every face," avoiding moralizing while reweighting limitation as legacy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("fractally precise strokes" mirroring prosopagnosia), but rhythmic control falters under peak stress—the explosion sequence maintains uniform lyricism without the compression demanded by "shower of dried leaves" chaos.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, though the adjacent coin-touching descriptions ("presses palm," "fingers trace") create a minor paraphrase loop in high-pressure beat, slightly dulling immediacy during the demolition's onset.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms the "outsider preserves wisdom" trope through the negative-space innovation, but the scholar's guild motif leans toward familiar archetypes without sufficient moral calculus to fully escape derivative resonance.</comment>
