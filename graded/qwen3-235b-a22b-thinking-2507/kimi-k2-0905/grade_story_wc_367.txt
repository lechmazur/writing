<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete action (wick cradled like "chilled vein of lightning"), but contradictory impulses lack development; motivation feels archetypal rather than individually earned despite strong embodied choices like tightening fingers on the wick during prophecy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: wick vanishing forces Lirael's transformation into "reader" with felt cost (barefoot on dew), but the conceptual cost of erased stars lacks sufficient on-page weight to reach 8.8+ despite Accumulative/Textural lens holding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Emerald lighthouse lens constrains all key choices (igniting wick, steering sail), with "glass lantern wick" evolving from tool to sacrificial membrane that charges the final image—exactly meeting 9+ gate requirement for micro-setting constraining choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shaping dawn via shadows) tightens through Lirael's laughter agency, but the cost of erasing stars remains abstract; "granite blocks groaned" provides physical consequence yet lacks emotional weight scaling to closure stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "ancient shadows as ink" motif, culminating in resonant CR closure where Lirael's shadow becomes "first letter" of unwritten stories—avoiding moralizing while reweighting the premise through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "porcelain echo that sliced salt air" and "hissed forgotten obituaries"; rhythmic control under pressure flawless with no head-hopping, though "shadowed elation" lacks modulation during climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-zero prose artifacts with masterful density ("printing reversed text across the inside of her eyelids"), but "ink bled outward, forming a vast dark sail" risks slight figurative muddle in high-pressure beat, blocking 9.0+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse mythology with post-print existentialism; "steering dawn via shadow" transforms tropes through specific logic (total internal reflection as printing mechanism), with risk-taking enhancing rather than obscuring stakes.</comment>
