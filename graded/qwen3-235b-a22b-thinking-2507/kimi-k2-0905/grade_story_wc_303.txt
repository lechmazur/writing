<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in thumb-melting string versus off-key singing choice; "mulberry ache turning septic" embodies emotional complexity. Minor deduction as shift to singing lacks one micro-choice showing the pivot from binary dilemma.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "fracture widened into a doorway" reconfigures destiny with conceptual cost ("dawn staining every decision"). Orientation anchored immediately; accumulative lens holds through coffee-stain fracture choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Velvet observatory constrains choices (dome lights lensed by melt-drop) and charges closure (puddle on velvet). Mulberry juice becomes "sweet water," transforming environment into active closure element per 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through visceral pressure: orchids screaming, stems bowing under violin's gravity. Cost legible in transformed promise ("color of maybe"), though emperor's threat slightly abstract compared to garden's immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "glassy ferns" and anthem perforations, avoiding moralizing. Final image answers central question via perforated garden paths, though "Rebellion Lite" syrup edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("frond-Morse," "sleepless stars") remains distinct under pressure. Deduction for orchids screaming "propagate freedom"—slight thematic echo in peak beat diluting subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero closure artifacts but "mulberry ache" repetition (3rd/4th use) borders scaffold; "lensing the dome lights" slightly techy for POV. High density maintained except minor register drift in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specific verisimilitude: ice violin as propagation seed, destiny perforation as iris. Emotional truth in "off-key, fearless" lullaby avoids generic rebellion templates.</comment>
