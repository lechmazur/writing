<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara's ritual: her trade (utility) vs. craft (beauty) creates tension. Micro-choices like speaking to objects reveal values under time pressure, though final renunciation lacks deeper conflict beyond completion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: "ledger balanced" crystallizes cost (fleeting dawn moment) under Accumulative lens. Orientation clear by line 3, but "assignment" phrasing risks slight tell-y abstraction in pivotal beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (pond rings, prism) constrains every choice and charges final image: "hairline cracks sealed" via recurring object. Sensory hierarchy perfectly filters through glazier's professional attention to light/refraction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (illuminate value before sunrise) tighten through Mara's agency—hurling prism is decisive—but escalation leans slightly on external "assignment" framing rather than fully internalized conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: teacup/harmonica/scar reweighted as "luminous relics" in final image. Avoids moralizing; "quiet radiance" resonates without stating value, fulfilling non-literal answer requirement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("read between lines of light") defines rhythm and diction. Tension modulates through sentence variation: "condensation slipped... striking the black mirror" shows pressure in syntax without loop artifacts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "coat flapping like a sail that had learned the wind’s true name" demonstrates rhythmic control. Slight register drift with "noctilucent reckonings" in early beat, but justified by dream context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: harbor glazier reading water rings as ledger transforms mundane into sacred. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over plot) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable through Carina-scar specificity.</comment>
