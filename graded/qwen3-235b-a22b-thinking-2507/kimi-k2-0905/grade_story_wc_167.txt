<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via trade-specific perception ("read between lines of light"); contradictory impulses in scar/Carina constellation reveal embodied conflict. Change earned through object dialogues, but motivation shift from private craft to communal illumination lacks sufficient friction under dawn pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: prism dissolves into "invisible lens," balancing the ledger as gulls riot. Orientation clear by line 1 (who/where/when); Accumulative lens holds through ripple patterns. Cost proof solid in "dissolved into the windows it healed."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Pearl Bay constrains every choice: condensation drip triggers reflections, rising sun pressures action. Micro-setting (pond rings) charges final image with "secret pattern expanding." Environment as active pressure source meets 9+ gate through causal role in Mara's ritual and healing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (illuminating value before sunrise audit) signaled early, pressure tightens via visible clock. Agency in speaking to objects narrows options, but escalation leans on external time pressure rather than Mara's active choices deepening the conflict under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: teacup/harmonica/scar reweighted by prism's light. Final image ("rings expanding still") answers "how to see value" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—no character states thesis—while scar's Carina shape embodies earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("read between lines of wood grain"); rhythm modulates from contemplative ("hush of Pearl Bay") to urgent ("hurled the glass"). No head-hopping; stress compression in "voice steady" maintains texture. Slight register drift in "noctilucent reckonings" barely touches closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "drip of condensation... striking the black mirror" avoids simultaneity errors. Minor paraphrase loop in identical "prism atrium in mist" phrasing (paragraphs 4/7) triggers −0.3 deduction. No figurative muddle; final line’s "ordinary miracles" avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glazier premise transformed via trade-specific vision ("storms slid off them like apologies"). Emotional truth in scar/Carina metaphor avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (lyric ritual as conflict resolution) heightens stakes without gimmickry; transformation test passed—replace "harbor glazier" with generic artisan breaks causality.</comment>
