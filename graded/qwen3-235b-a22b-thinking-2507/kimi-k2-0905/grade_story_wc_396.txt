<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses (suppressed sorrow vs. swallowed empathy) drive the climax; her final choice to reconstitute the sphere earns closure through prior causality ("fed it her own restrained sorrow" → swallowing crate).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: the reconstituted sphere transforms the border from barricade to bridge, with undeniable conceptual cost ("mapping feeling onto action became the only protocol"). Accumulative lens holds through density escalation (mirror shards → colliding birds → harbor).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice floes actively pressure tactics ("ground lighthouse from its perch at dawn"), while the apple bough constrains the climax choice (hanging the sphere). Final image charged by "ripe apples instead of salt" reweighting the setting's emotional logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stake (thin border) tightens through Mara's agency: her "I witness you whole" causes crates to burst and Keeper's dissolution. Cost is unmistakable in the Keeper's fall ("dissolving into dark water that tasted of every tear he had sold").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (bottled emotions → sphere dripping empathy), avoiding moralizing. Final image ("border thicken, no longer barricade but bridge") reweights the premise without stating a moral, fulfilling Conceptual Repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("emotional residue clinging to every object") and rhythmic control ("breathed once, twice, matching cadence of sea") persist under pressure. No head-hopping; elision (memory-harbor shard) taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "colliding birds" metaphor precisely serves pressure. Minor deduction for "bruise-colored clouds" (slight register drift), but closure image ("voice steady, heart unhidden") maintains crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "lighthouse keeper" trope via memory-harbor market; "selling empathy" premise feels fresh. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, with final image recharging the ice floes' meaning.</comment>
