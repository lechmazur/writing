<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Kael’s "calmly intuitive" trait versus blood-frozen trauma; embodied cost in "muscles burning like lanterns" during rescue. Sira’s chromatic scale avoids diagnostic labels but her exile backstory feels compressed, slightly flattening her agency in the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the net-tangled collapse crystallizes cost (blue lips, frozen spray knives) with causal pressure from the ice crack. "Weighted breath" timeframe tightens choices, though the fishing net’s convenience slightly undermines Kael’s agency without prior setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ice floes actively constrain choices (glazed ladder rungs, skiff-crushing threat), while vintage mirrors charge the closure via Sira tracing shadow-laced threads. Every detail—from quince trunks to printer’s ink water—serves urgency, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes narrow meaningfully when the ice crack forces Kael’s decisive "north by northeast" command. The two futures vision deepens internal/external conflict, but Sira’s net discovery risks coincidental resolution without earlier foreshadowing of the abandoned gear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "map empathy onto action" becomes Kael treating Sira’s peril as "a coordinate on his own skin," culminating in the net-as-treaty image. Zero moralizing; chromatic scale and shadow-laced coat reweight empathy without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Kael’s silence-measuring ("sailors listen to foghorns") and stress-compressed syntax ("He breathed once, slow and deliberate"). No head-hopping; lyrical density taught early pays off in the final coat-touching beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in high-pressure beats; "frozen spray into lattice of tiny knives" merges image and cost. Minor register drift in "chromatic scale" (slightly clinical) but compensated by visceral "braided lead line cold enough to brand palms."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse orchard mechanics (ice-shifting terrain) and cartography-as-empathy. Risk-taking heightens stakes: vintage mirrors reconstitute possibility via "Morse of angles," avoiding tropey crystal ball clichés through embodied action.</comment>
