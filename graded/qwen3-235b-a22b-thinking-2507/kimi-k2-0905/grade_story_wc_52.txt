<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete ("thumb calloused from safety ropes," "sawdust soaked up blood without complaint") and flaws feel authentic, but Emil’s presence remains spectral despite vivid memories, thinning relationship dynamics crucial for widowhood stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the rain-beaded glass reflecting "both her face and the empty ring" crystallizes "here and gone" with undeniable cost, holding the Accumulative/Textural lens through sensory density shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ash wood blank and cage latch function as micro-setting, constraining choices (carving with tent stake chisel) and charging the final image; steam "ghosting like animal breath" mirrors grief without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Mara’s agency ("move slow, speak softer") with visible cost (sawdust jars labeled "Manes & Mettle"), but "rust-hued peace" over-explains the emotional price slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "here and gone" evolves from Emil’s dialogue to the final glass reflection, reweighting memory without moralizing; the carving’s duality ("cage and key") answers the central question resonantly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp (noticing "grain swirl like the mane"), with rhythmic control modulating under pressure; only "rust-hued peace" repetition risks slight scaffold in later beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or artifacts in peak beats; "sawdust and thunder" shows textural density, though "rust-hued peace" recurs with diminishing novelty, nudging toward thematic echo without breaking closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes through specific, lived details (carving with tent stake, sawdust jars as "spices"); risk-taking in mosaic shards feels inevitable, not gimmicky, heightening emotional stakes cohesively.</comment>
