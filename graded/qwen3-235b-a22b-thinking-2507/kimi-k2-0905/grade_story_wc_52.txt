<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses manifest concretely: preserving Emil through carving while acknowledging "cages were made to open." Micro-choices like sanding the smile to match the photo reveal her hierarchy of values. Embodied emotion avoids therapy-speak via "rust-hued peace" and sawdust-soaked blood memories. Final renunciation of static grief earns closure through causal progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: memory as "both cage and key" reweights the premise with undeniable cost in the rain-reflected final image. Accumulative lens holds consistently through sensory density shifts. Orientation anchors immediately with "rain-beaded skylight loft" and kettle sounds. Cost proof is visceral in "swept the shavings into a jar labeled 'Manes & Mettle'."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ash wood carving blank functions as micro-setting, constraining choices by dictating carving techniques that shape the narrative arc. Rain-beaded skylight charges the closure image through reflection physics. Sensory hierarchy filters sawdust/thunder through Mara's profession, avoiding tourist catalog. Final image fails without the loft's reflective properties altering spatial perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (containing vs. releasing memory) tightens when carving crystallizes her realization that memory is "both cage and key." Agency drives escalation through her tactile choices—sanding the smile, sweeping shavings—altering tactics under accumulative pressure. Cost legibility peaks in the labeled jars, where "rust-hued peace" transforms from blood-soaked sawdust to comforting cloak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the carving metaphor without moralizing: "memory can be both cage and key" reweights prior material as a non-literal answer to holding what's gone. Final line's "here and gone in the same breath" charges the central question with conceptual cost. Avoids thematic echo despite "here and gone" recurrence by grounding abstraction in the rain-reflected image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "surface smelled of sawdust and thunder"—professionally filtered noticing. Rhythmic control under pressure via fragmented cadence during carving ("move slow, speak softer, never blink first"). Consistent close-third focalization with intentional psychic distance shifts (e.g., "she felt the room tilt into the past"). Zero head-hopping despite memory shards.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "rust-hued peace" reprises with charged specificity from blood-soaked sawdust to comforting cloak. Information density soars: "steam ghosting the loft like the breath of animals" advances atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. Final line's parallel structure ("her face and the empty ring") earns lyricism through causal buildup.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms widowhood tropes through profession-specific details: "harvest trust from predators" reframes grief as active taming. "Rust-hued peace" avoids cliché by tethering color to blood and sawdust. Risk-taking heightens stakes via accumulative structure—memory shards crystallize into conceptual repricing without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth anchors universals in verifiable craft details.</comment>
