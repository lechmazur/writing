<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; bottled whisper motivation remains abstract despite vivid embodied choices like ink-soaking skin. Final endurance earns closure but micro-choices don’t fully expose hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully with the "sigil behind heartbeat" image reweighting eternity’s cost. Accumulative lens holds through frost-pattern reconfiguration, though orientation delay slightly obscures the Shift’s mechanics early on.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: frost-patterns actively constrain choices (reading code at dawn) and charge the final image where Corwin inhales the spiral. Glass orchard’s melting pears and ticking numerals directly alter tactics during rupture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Corwin’s agency as the bottled whisper’s use triggers escalating system failures (cracking apples, listing deck). Cost is legible in the library’s dissolution but moral calculus lacks competing goods depth at peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "compressing eternity" crystallizes in ink-soaked skin and type slugs as breath-shortening seconds. Final image reweights rupture as invitation without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite high abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in frost-as-syllable and "cloud-vellum" textures. Rhythmic control under rupture pressure ("pages fluttering," "soundless laugh") avoids head-hopping despite mirror-keeper’s brief appearance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; "frost teeth" and "cloud-sea" metaphors deepen causality. Slight overwriting in "steel orchid" description risks density but pays off through press’s later awakening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of letterpress mechanics and reality rupture feels inevitable. Risk-taking (e.g., negotiable air, time-folding) heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes through specific "type slugs clinking like tiny bells" details.</comment>
