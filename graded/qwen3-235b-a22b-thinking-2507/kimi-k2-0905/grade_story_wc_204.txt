<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Corwin's cracked chase interiority shows embodied contradiction (ink-stained hands vs. precise type-setting), but mirror-keeper remains off-page abstraction weakening relationship crucible. Micro-choices like uncorking the whisper earn the rupture's cost through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing when rupture becomes "invitation" with visceral cost: library destabilization and ink soaking into skin. Orientation perfect in opening line; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through frost-pattern reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glass orchard constrains choices actively—frost patterns dictate timing, melting pears become hourglasses. Final sigil ("tuck behind a heartbeat") charges closure by transforming setting into portable eternity. Meets 9+ gate via recurring object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Corwin's agency: bottled whisper release causes immediate system collapse (cracked apples, sliding books). Cost legible in reality's renegotiation, though "sky noticing" warning lacks tangible escalation prior to climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reweighting: "rupture begins with breathing" shifts from ominous to liberating in final image. Frost writing his name avoids moralizing while resonating with compression motif—no thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("frost branched like copper wires"), with rhythmic control under pressure ("pages fluttering... printing themselves in reverse"). Single-POV consistency maintained; no filter-verb stacks in high-stakes beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-loop in "glass apples cracked... pears melted" slightly reduces propulsion, but "ticking numerals" metaphor holds logic. Zero scaffold; every line advances atmosphere or causality (e.g., "type slugs clinking like tiny bells" charges closure).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: letterpress as "steel orchid" and reality as "negotiable" transform tropes. Emotional specificity in "cracked chase" avoids abstraction; risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
