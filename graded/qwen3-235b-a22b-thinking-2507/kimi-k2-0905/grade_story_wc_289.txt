<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction crystallizes in "loved for others until my own heart became a palimpsest"; the final choice to sign her own name is earned through tactile micro-choices like coiling the twig spiral into the bronze throat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost in "heart became a palimpsest"; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density shifts from temple stillness to pond shattering without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The bronze throat armature—a micro-setting object—constrains Mira’s pivotal choice (whispering truth) and charges the final image; lily pads "gleaming like green coins" evolve causally with the storm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Mira recognizes her ghostwritten lines on the mirrors, narrowing options to either retreat or whisper her truth; the cost is unmistakable in "heart became a palimpsest" with felt conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the palimpsest metaphor and letters becoming public music; the final image ("she was the thread") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting the thread motif with earned complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "prismatic quiet" and "ink still seeping through the canvas"; rhythmic control under pressure ("ripples carried her reflection into kaleidoscopic pieces") avoids head-hopping while modulating with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "paper wept" achieves high density without muddle, and the final line "she was the thread" recharges the opening motif with crystal-clear propulsion and no figurative clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms the artist’s journey through specific, grounded details (thrush’s nest spiral, bronze throat); the public art installation method feels fresh and inevitable, avoiding safety-middle tropes with bold structural choices.</comment>
