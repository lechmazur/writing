<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arin's motivation crystallizes through embodied micro-choices (pruning, weaving) and the pivotal shift from trapping to sharing wonder; grandmother's lullabies root interiority but "wonder" risks slight abstraction despite strong physicality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when Arin flings droplets across the gorge—cost visible in loom's collapse and his aging—under a consistent Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The verdant parapet actively constrains choices (mist's reach enabling loom) and charges the final image (sapling roots "half in soil, half in dream"); waterfall's veil evolves causally into the "door" between worlds.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (preserving wonder's color) escalates through accumulative pressure as hues gather and loom buckles; Arin's agency in redefining "succor" as sharing—not hoarding—carries undeniable cost in the collapse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the sapling's "fruit would be story" and children chasing hues reweight the premise without moralizing; cost is conceptual (wonder requires dispersal) made visceral through "laughter—tentonic, then torrential".</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("moss became emerald flame") with rhythmic control under pressure; syntax compresses during climax ("Color gathered—coral, indigo, gold—swirling") without sacrificing clarity or voice consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary from lyrical ("threads of liquid light weaving between worlds") to staccato ("He flung the remaining droplets high") with no figurative muddle—final line's cadence ("forever radiant, forever hush") crystallizes closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tropes transformed: "weaving between worlds" literalized via willow loom and pigment physics; emotional specificity (Arin's aging yet "lighter") avoids abstraction, while risk-taking elevates stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
