<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("hearts ache with nostalgia for places he had never stood") with limited embodied contradiction under pressure; final choice earned but micro-choices lack visceral struggle despite strong generational motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise RR lands with undeniable cost: petals pausing mid-air as Kael's destined fracture seals, reconfiguring exile through "widening spirals" with Accumulative lens held throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Nebula garden actively constrains choice (petals parting for beacon) and charges closure as "cool radiance" blooms; gear functions as micro-setting whose impossible ratio resolves the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stake tightening through sonar pinging's pattern break delivers protagonist-driven deepening; cost is unmistakable in "crack destined for his own heart seal[ing]" under Accumulative escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through gear/beacon mechanics: "widening spirals" reweights generational exile without moralizing; grandmother's prophecy transforms into "wave that carries the break" with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("petals of ionized gas drifting across the quiet sigh"); rhythmic control under pressure ("teeth blurred, approximating infinity in motion") with zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "generational patterns encoded as hairline fractures" exemplifies high-density propulsion; no figurative muddle even in climax where gear "resolved into rhythm".</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"Sharing light without fire" premise transformed through buried beacon's "living starlight"; risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
