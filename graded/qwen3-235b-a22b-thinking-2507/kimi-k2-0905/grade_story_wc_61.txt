<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete actions: Kael's gear-clutching and sonar-tuning reveal contradictory impulses (rooted sorrow vs. transmission). Final choice earned by generational pattern confrontation, though "hearts ache with nostalgia" slightly abstracts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: beacon disintegration and gear's silence manifest cost when petals glow flamelessly. Accumulative lens holds through pattern deepening (97-year fractures to harmonic colors), with orientation clear by first sentence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Nebula garden actively constrains choices: sinking boots in diamond pollen and petal-slowed movement charge the climax. Gear's micro-setting function (vibrating teeth resolving infinity) directly shapes the final image's cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through pattern deepening: 97-year fractures narrow Kael's options until the sharper echo forces stance crystallization. Cost crystallizes when beacon crumbles—identity transforms from exile to courier with visible relinquishment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through mechanics: "light without fire" resolves via gear/beacon resonance without moralizing. Final image ("carrying nothing except the echo") reweights exile as transmission, avoiding thematic echo while charging generational patterns with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "brass teeth warm against his palms" and "hydrogen blossoms" filter setting through Kael's sentient calculus. Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure (staccato beats at beacon discovery), with zero head-hopping in single-POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "petals of ionized gas drifting across the quiet sigh" demonstrates rhythmic propulsion. Final line recharges opening motif flawlessly. Minor deduction for "troubling serenity" abstraction early on, though redeemed later.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms space opera tropes via specific mechanics: calculating gear's infinity ratio enables the flameless light climax. Emotional truth in quiet transformation avoids sentimentality; risk-taking (lyric Accumulative lens) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
