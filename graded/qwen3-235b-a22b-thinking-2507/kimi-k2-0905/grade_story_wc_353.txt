<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied action ("breathes with that pulse") without diagnostic labels; contradictory impulses (silence vs creation) drive the strumming climax with visible cost in trembling knees and redefined world perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: the grove's reawakening ("not noise, but conversation") carries undeniable conceptual cost (worldview shattered) under a held Accumulative/Textural lens, with orientation anchored by line 3 ("hush of needles settling on moss").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The alder grove functions as active micro-setting—needles shiver, sap rises in response to strumming—and the porcelain insulator charges the final image (glowing "storing the new anthem"), meeting the 9+ gate for environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (silent world vs music) escalate through Ilay's agency: mapping cracks to melody narrows options to the final arpeggio, with visceral cost (trembling knees, redefined reality) unmistakable when she "hears for the first time... conversation—tree to bird to soil."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "empathy in motion" becomes literal music ("sorrow learning it can also be comfort"), avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights silence as "conversation" without stated morals, achieving non-literal thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless ("symphonically minded" coloring all observation); rhythmic control under pressure peaks in the strumming sequence ("softer, softer") with zero head-hopping or register drift, embodying the focalizer's artistic psyche.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "glassy ping that ricochets like a startled deer" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor deduction for "residual resonance" abstraction, but momentum remains crystalline through the final arpeggio.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms ecological grief through music theory specificity (cracks as "minor third"); the insulator-crack mapping feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking (silent world premise) heightens stakes without gimmickry, fulfilling the 9+ synthesis test.</comment>
