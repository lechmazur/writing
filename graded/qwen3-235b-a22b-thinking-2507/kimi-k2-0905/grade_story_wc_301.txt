<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "daringly methodical" chronicling versus frozen inaction; embodied cost of "rope that lay coiled" and final forgiveness choice earned through tactile micro-choices like folding the paper boat. Slight deduction for "daringly methodical" leaning toward label over demonstrated tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "the map referenced not where water went, but where I chose to stay" crystallizes stance with felt cost in "forgave the twelve-year-old." Orientation clear by line 1; Accumulative lens holds through river/station pattern payoff. Medication thread slightly under-integrated into climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Disused station actively pressures choices—ivy translates confession, rails become boat launch site. Accordion tape (father's cigarettes) and river stones constrain the forgiveness arc, charging the final image where "ivy continued stitching the station." No generic placeholder details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (self-forgiveness) tightens through paper boat act: "chronicle again... but the entries would begin with today." Cost unmistakable in "withdrawal tremor steady into heartbeat" and rope-forgiveness. Medication's role as pressure source lacks full dramatization in escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete action: bathroom graffiti reprises as lived truth in boat offering, not moralizing. Final image ("stepped onto the path that was no longer his, but mine") reweights prior material without stating a moral. Zero thematic echo or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "river slapped the aluminum hull" and "phosphorescent grin of foxfire." Rhythmic control peaks with short bursts ("I did not look back") amid lyrical flow. Zero head-hopping; elision of flood memory taught early and paid in confession beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ivory continued stitching the station" charges closure while serving multiple functions. Only deduction: "daringly methodical" slightly abstract amid otherwise concrete prose. Final line’s dissolution into night achieves propulsion without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief tropes through specific tools (cigarette-tape accordion) and stakes (mapping as resurrection attempt). Risk-taking heightens coherence: mosaic of river/station/graffiti converges into "path that was no longer his." Avoids safety middle with raw, unredemptive solace.</comment>
