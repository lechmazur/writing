<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Aera’s surrender to the fossil, but "ache older than grammar" veers into therapy-speak. Embodied cost lands via throat rawness and collapse, though diagnostic phrasing slightly undercuts authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (floating staff guiding future wakers) reconfigures silence into witness with conceptual cost. Lens holds firmly: Accumulative pressure via sensory density shifts. Cost proof weakens final image—dissolution into rumor lacks concrete on-page legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cave walls’ thermal shifts directly charge closure: ochre/violet → cool/steady hues mirror Aera’s transformation. Tide line positioning constrains fossil discovery, and the staff’s final float reweights prior sorrow into navigable paths.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (voice for the unknown) tightens through fossil’s heat inversion. Agency-driven escalation—Aera’s choice to press leaf—narrows options to surrender. Cost (dissolution) feels conceptual but lacks visceral on-page weight at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: thermal glyphs, salt-tasting voice, and "sonic layers" reflect Aera’s map-maker lens. Rhythmic control peaks in climax ("sound poured out—not words but weather"). Zero head-hopping despite solo POV intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" diction clash and filter-verb stacks ("breath clouding... saw... pressed") dull climax immediacy. Paraphrase loops in reflection ("transitional objects... bridges") trigger -1.7 artifact penalty—closure beat obscured by lyrical scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of geological time and emotional resonance via heat-mapped longing. Risk-taking elevates tropes: fossil as "bridge refusing shores" transforms clichés into earned conceptual repricing without gimmickry.</comment>
