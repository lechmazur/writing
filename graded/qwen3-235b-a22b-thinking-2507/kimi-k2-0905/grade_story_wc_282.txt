<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aera's motivation ("voice of the unknown") drives concrete micro-choices under pressure, especially pressing the fossil despite mentors' warnings. Interior contradiction shines in her scientific precision clashing with mystical surrender. Minor abstraction in "ache older than grammar" slightly weakens embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: sensory density escalates through heat-map inversion to sonic transformation. Charged Poise closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost (Aera dissolving while legacy persists). Slight momentum dip at "breath clouding" moment barely touches escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cave network actively constrains choices (tide line position critical) and charges final image via the staff's float. Fossil as micro-setting reshapes environment ("colors draining into leaf"). Meets 9+ gate by making mineral floor's warmth a tactile cost marker.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize early: speaking for vs. being spoken through the unknown. Escalation via fossil's heat inversion forces Aera's agency (pressing it, singing), narrowing options to dissolution. Cost is visceral—collapse, cheek on warm stone—and conceptually charges the legacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the fossil's transformation from "stone" to "beating node," avoiding moralizing. Final image ("lighthouse without fire") answers the central question non-literally. No thematic echo; "proving the unknown found a voice" is earned through action, not assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("turquoise hush," "thermal glyphs") filters all observation. Rhythm modulates masterfully: lyrical discovery shifts to staccato transformation ("sound poured out—not words but weather"). Zero head-hopping; stress compresses diction without losing texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Line craft near-flawless: "ochre and violet, the afterburn of longing" achieves high density without scaffold. Only minor abstraction ("ache older than grammar") redeemed by immediate concrete action. Final line’s "leaf guides rain to roots" avoids cliché through specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes via sensory mapping science; "factually mystical" angle feels fresh. Every detail serves the core concept (elm leaf’s flexibility matters). Risk-taking (sound as weather) heightens stakes without gimmickry, earning the +0.3 risk distinction.</comment>
