<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's surrender of mother's humming memory feels earned through embodied hesitation and root-constrained pressure; Lira's "fiercely gentle" motivation stays character-particular via hollowed eyes after trade. Minor opacity in Lira's backstory limits full contradiction depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "holes that sang now with the hum" crystallizes the cost of memory loss with undeniable conceptual weight. Accumulative lens holds through density of bone-root symbiosis; no causality breaks despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard actively constrains choices (roots tightening like wires) and charges closure via star-sprout emitting lost hum. Sensory details—damp earth, charred card—filter through narrator's war-torn urgency without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (patching soul holes) tightens through single, high-cost memory trade where agency forecloses path with visceral cost: "warmth exiting through the circle." Accumulative escalation reweights "holes" from leaks to light-channels without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "weaving new cloth, leaving deliberate spaces" avoids moralizing. Final sprout-hum reweights "holes" as resonant spaces, though Lira's "light to enter" line flirts with thematic echo but stays character-grounded.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("candle smoke," "bones jutted") persists under stress; diction compresses during trade ("I nodded, surrendering"). Zero head-hopping; dialogue carries subtext ("destinies required symmetry") while reflecting Lira's idealism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; every line charges momentum ("apple tree shuddered; its fruit glowed dimly"). Metaphors coherent (tarot as soul-patch), final image resonates without muddle. Slight repetition of "dusky resolve" serves intentional motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tarot bartering with bone-root symbiosis transforms memory-loss trope. Catacomb orchard as living ledger feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without obscuring closure's hum-sprout charge.</comment>
