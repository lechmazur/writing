<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rowan's motivation ("waiting for one small kindness") is embodied through concrete micro-choices like placing the button in Marcus's file, avoiding therapy-speak. Great-uncle connection risks convenience but saved by tactile specificity of the button's "eagle worn smooth by thumbs long dead." Interior contradiction between stipend lie and truth holds tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "the unknown was no longer an abyss but a hallway" crystallizes stance with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—dust patterns deepen into Marcus's file, then snowflakes. Orientation clear by line 3 ("foster care file room"). Cost proof in "letting the cold unfurl against her skin like a promise."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dust functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (brushing ridges to read histories) and charges the final image (snowflakes as "small kindnesses"). File room's mildew smell and "closingtime" scent create pressure through tactile specificity. "Concentric halos" of dust on tabletop brilliantly mirrors the thematic reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes ("unknown histories not being waste") deepen through Rowan's agency—dust reading shifts from wounds to "spaces between wounds where light might enter." But escalation lacks visible price; the emotional shift ("walked home lighter") feels earned but cost isn't unmistakable on-page beyond internal realization. Single tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through dust-to-snow transformation: "magnified one small kindness into a compass" reweights the button's meaning without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by showing (not telling) how small acts reroute history. Final image ("snowflake... almost readable") offers resonant answer to "was the past waste?" through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "dust patterns... revealed concentric halos, as if every file above had breathed onto this spot." Rhythmic control under pressure ("First came a crescent... Next, a hard line...") taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; single-POV interiority modulates from melancholy to "tactfully hopeful" without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "light unfurl across its dents like sunrise over a battlefield" does triple duty (sensory, thematic, emotional). "Afterimage glowed" slightly risks overwriting but serves closure. Final line ("button in hand, ready to be found") recharges button motif with crystalline clarity. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms foster care/WII tropes through dust-pattern archaeology—fresh angle where archives become "futures disguised as pasts." Emotional truth in "small kindness" motif avoids sentimentality. Risk-taking (dust as narrative engine) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Slight familiarity in button motif prevents 9.0.</comment>
