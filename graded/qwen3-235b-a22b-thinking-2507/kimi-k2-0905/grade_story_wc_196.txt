<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "waiting for one small kindness" vs stipend rationale; micro-choice placing button earns closure with visible emotional cost in "walked home lighter." No therapy-speak, embodied emotion throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("unknown was no longer an abyss but a hallway") crystallizes options with undeniable cost in "walked home lighter." Accumulative lens holds perfectly; dust patterns → snowflakes reweight stakes without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dust functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (brushing patterns) and charges final image (snowflakes magnifying light). Sensory details reflect urgency: "dust yield like old scab" during discovery, calmer "breathing onto this spot" later.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early ("waiting for one small kindness"); escalation through density shift as dust reveals "spaces between wounds." Agency-driven deepening when Rowan places button, narrowing options with felt cost in "lighter" departure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through button/snowflake parallels without moralizing. Final image "magnifying dim streetlight into something almost readable" offers resonant answer to "was past waste?" while embracing ambiguity of Marcus's fate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "dust yield like old scab," "afterimage glowed." Rhythm modulates from dense ("concentric halos") to sparse ("let the dark breathe") under pressure. Zero head-hopping; voice consistent in reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "unfurl" motif earns repetition through closure linkage. Slight register risk in "tactfully hopeful" redeemed by embodied context ("dust itself seemed..."). Final line’s rhythm crystallizes Charged Poise without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms foster care trope through dust-button-snowflake synthesis. Emotional specificity in "garbage bag of clothes" memory avoids generic templates. Risk-taking with accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
