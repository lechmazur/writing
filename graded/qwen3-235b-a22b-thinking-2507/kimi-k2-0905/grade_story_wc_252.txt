<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction ("true nature was motion, not duty") drives her arc with embodied choices; council’s functional pressure lacks secondary depth. Whale’s call prying "guarded hearts" avoids therapy-speak through visceral memory release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands flawlessly: harpoon unmaking reweights freedom with conceptual cost ("stop translating your heartbeat"). Accumulative lens holds, though council confrontation feels slightly convenient as escalation point.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: sublittoral fringe supplies urchins/uniforms for raft-building; scrimshaw’s vibration charges final image. Glass orchards actively constrain choice ("fight for softness without apology").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lira’s agency: "detaching" forecloses duty path with felt cost (island "erased from maps"). Whale’s call deepens knowledge, but council’s arrival lacks sufficient pressure escalation for 9.2+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: unmaking harpoon reweights freedom without moralizing. Final cliff-dance image answers "true nature" question with resonant ambiguity, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: occupational diction ("choreography of cargo") modulates under stress. Prose rhythm mirrors emotional cadence ("humming the whale’s descending scale"), no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "tide pools cradling urchins and torn uniforms" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Slight deduction for "combative tenderness" repetition without evolution in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: dock worker’s cargo skills repurposed for raft-building transforms refugee trope. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes, though whale motif echoes existing archetypes.</comment>
