<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority excels with embodied choices (shell grammar, death-by-ink trade) but "retrocognitively trapped" explanation risks diagnostic label-speak. Contradictory impulses—truth-seeking vs. self-preservation—drive the climax with visible cost in marrow-deep memory absorption.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the broadcast over the capital crystallizes irreversible stakes with conceptual cost ("names now unerasable"). Causal escalation holds tight—each trade narrows options until the final, costly choice to speak truth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon actively constrains choices (shackling ankles, demanding future fragments), while the zeppelin's ascent enables the climax. "Burnt ink" sunset charges the final image, though "volcanic glass" detail feels generically functional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (truth vs. self-preservation) tightens relentlessly through Mireya's agency: each traded future fragment forecloses paths. Cost is visceral in "years rearrange inside me" and the lagoon's stillness after decryption.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: the lagoon's encryption mechanic embodies truth's cost without moralizing. Final image—"names now unerasable because spoken above the lagoon"—resonates as a non-literal answer to "can buried truth be reclaimed?"</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines: archivist precision ("scallop edges for vowels") fractures into raw urgency during the broadcast. Rhythmic control under pressure ("my voice a searing reverie") avoids all register drift or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with purposeful density ("liquid night under day"), though "retrocognitively trapped" slightly overwrites. Zero loops; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes, especially the closure's "burnt ink" cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms "magic object" trope via specific mechanics (shell grammar, future-trading). Fresh inflection: truth isn't recovered but *encrypted into the archivist*, making the broadcast an act of self-sacrifice that reweights memory's cost.</comment>
