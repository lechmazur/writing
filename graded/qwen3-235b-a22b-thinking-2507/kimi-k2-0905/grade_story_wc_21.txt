<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "futures closing like doors" during memory trades, but mother's betrayal reveal lacks embodied physical reaction beyond salt-throat; micro-choices like offering death date feel earned though slightly over-articulated under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly when she reads over the lagoon—cost crystallized in "crown me or crucify me" with visible stake reconfiguration; Accumulative lens holds as memory trades tighten options relentlessly toward the broadcast.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon's physical constraint (sand shackles) directly alters tactics during decryption; final image of burnt-ink pages over the lagoon recharges the "liquid night" opening with conceptual cost, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen organically through lagoon's retrocognitive cost ("years rearrange inside me"), but "ink-poisoning" death detail feels slightly convenient rather than inevitable escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: shells reconfiguring into truth-telling tools at climax answers "memory as burden" without moralizing; avoids final-paragraph sermonizing despite high stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("kerosene onto ready flame") reflects archivist's precision under pressure; rhythmic control shifts from clinical ("field notebook, stylus") to visceral ("throat full of salt") without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops in peak beats, but "liquid night under day" slightly overwrought for crisis moment; high density maintained except minor scaffold in "arranged beach debris as messages" description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms archive trope via obsidian lagoon's physical encryption mechanic; "truth arranged in shells" final image feels inevitable yet fresh, avoiding derivative premise with specific civil-rights context.</comment>
