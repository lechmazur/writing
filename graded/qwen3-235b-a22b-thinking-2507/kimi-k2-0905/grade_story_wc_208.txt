<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority grounded in driftwood grain and storm; "perpetually learning" trait drives micro-choices like wedging the slide, but contradictory impulses slightly underdeveloped at climax when carving becomes pure harmony.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: GPS drowned for "unmarked map," storm's hush crystallizing options. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds perfectly, though "perpetually learning" repetition weakens final causality integration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Archway as "ledger" constrains every choice—carving with wood's memory, slide's fissure—charging the final miniature arch. Sensory specificity ("shipwreck and pine pitch") mirrors internal state without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via protagonist agency: slide's projection forces Maela to reinterpret "escape as arrival," culminating in GPS sacrifice. Cost legible ("left it drowned"), but "timewoven alliances" concept lacks tactical friction during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through barnacle-like layered gestures, not moralizing. Final image ("just horizon, just wood") reweights "debt and rescue" without stating it, though "timewoven alliances" remains abstract rather than integrated into Maela's choice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "chisel ringing like small bell," driftwood smelling of "shipwreck and pine pitch." Rhythmic control intensifies under storm pressure ("turbine-hum rose... pulse recruited"), zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose nearly flawless—"barnacles accrete" for layered meaning—but "perpetually learning" refrain (3x) borders on template cadence in high-pressure beats, slightly dulling closure's propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis: driftwood sculptor reimagining archway as ledger transforms "debt/rescue" trope. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative lens) heightens stakes; specificity ("cedar box for safe passage") avoids generic abstraction.</comment>
