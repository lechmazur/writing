<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction lacks depth; "perpetually learning" trait remains label without struggle. Micro-choices under pressure (wedging slide, carving method) align with motives but no authentic internal conflict. Final renunciation of GPS earns closure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: storm intensifies sensory density toward Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). Closure lands with undeniable cost—dissolved slide, abandoned GPS—as final image reweights "escape as arrival" through miniature archway.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Archway as "ledger" constrains every choice; storm actively shapes tactics (using violence for armature). Final image of pocket archway charges closure with environmental specificity. "Turbine-hum" evolves from metaphor to tangible rhythm, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (gift vs. geas) tightens through protagonist's agency—wedging slide reconfigures shadows into tangible pressure. Cost is legible in dissolved slide and GPS abandonment, but stakes remain intellectual rather than visceral, limiting escalation depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through timewoven alliances motif: final gulls scattering through the arch offers resonant, non-literal answer to "debt and rescue" without moralizing. Closure image reweights "scaffold complexity with simplicity" into universal journey, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("grammar of currents," "barnacles accrete meaning") shines under pressure. Minor register drift in "timewoven alliances" slightly jars. Rhythmic control excels—sentences accelerate with storm, breathe in hush—but filter verb ("understood") weakens immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "chisel ringing like a small bell" fuses action/image. Paraphrase loop in "perpetually learning" (lines 3/14) triggers -0.3 deduction. Zero figurative muddle; final line’s "just horizon, just wood" achieves crystalline density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms driftwood trope through "ledger" conceit and miniature archway closure. Risk-taking (Accumulative lens, lyric closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in "shadows thickening until they leaned against the archway" avoids generic templates.</comment>
