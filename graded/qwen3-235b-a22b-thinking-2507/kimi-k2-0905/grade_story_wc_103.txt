<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but lacks contradictory impulses; crushing fragment feels inevitable without micro-choices showing value hierarchy under pressure. Motivation clear but not conflicted in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "texture of time was not to be discovered but planted" reweights premise while seed-in-pocket image charges final stakes. Accumulative lens holds flawlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Garden's moss/planks pulse and shift but never constrain choices—Elara walks regardless of Möbius curves. Final seed image charges theme yet environment remains atmospheric rather than tactical per 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: crushing fragment forecloses linear identity with visceral cost ("veins becoming roots"). One meaningful escalation suffices, with cost unmistakable in "sharpened" photo via release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image ("maze was inside her... each beat a turn") offers non-literal answer to "texture of time" without moralizing. Theme emerges from seed motif charging closure through embodied cost of letting go.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("boots sinking into moss-covered planks that pulsed") modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control flawless but minor register drift in "retrocognitively trapped" slightly jars established voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "wet clay, yielding and reforming" crystallizes theme without muddle. Slight density in opening ("whispered childhood name") but peak beats maintain propulsion and clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synthesis of maze design with memory-as-time feels inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric structure, retrocognitive trap) heightens stakes without gimmickry, anchored by "seed" reconfiguration that avoids cliché.</comment>
