<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (ambition vs stillness) embodied through sensory choices; closure choice to release ambition earned by graft ritual's cost. Mother cameo lacks development but doesn't harm core causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to Charged Poise closure where "serenity no longer a goal but a companion" crystallizes cost of abandoned ambition. Tide reversal provides live clock for graft timing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Corpse flower seed constrains every choice (rot detection, grafting technique); final image of "wildflower hush following" charges the closure. Micro-setting functions as full environment with perfect specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (perfect graft timing) escalates through sensory precision; cost of relinquished ambition ("meant to astonish... village astonished her") is legible when seed's early bloom shifts her goal. Tide reversal tightens temporal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: figure-eight graft knot embodies "serenity within motion," final descent reweights opening tension without moralizing. "What is hidden feeds what is revealed" avoids thematic echo by serving ritual function.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature defined by olfactory focus ("carrion promise," "bruised banana"); rhythm mirrors treetop sway ("bridge became a limb, then a twig"). Zero register drift during high-pressure grafting sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "odor of sweet death drifted like lullaby" delivers peak-beat clarity. Minor metaphor risk in "tide thinks" offset by payoff in sap/tide synchronization. Final line recharges opening with zero redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms corpse flower trope through wrapping paper ritual and olfactory precision. Tide reversal as "thought" creates fresh causal mechanism; emotional specificity avoids generic serenity tropes. Risk-taking elevates without gimmickry.</comment>
