<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Contradictory ambition/gratitude impulses culminate in earned shift when village "astonishes her"; embodied emotion avoids label-speak despite high-stakes olfactory precision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visible cost: "ambition loosen into gratitude" crystallizes after grafting, with exchanged breath with mother proving emotional cost under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Spider-silk and corpse seed constrain grafting tactics then charge final image; "planks narrowing to mere suggestion" forces embodied choices while scent hierarchy mirrors urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Single tightening: olfactory constraint forces "breathing through mouth" trade-off during graft, with unmistakable cost in ambition's dissolution against the tide's "hush inside roar".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final "quiet heart" drawing reweights "serenity within motion" without moralizing; doodled wrapping paper motif charges closure through "what is hidden feeds what is revealed" action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: scent progression ("iron, then bruised banana") modulates under pressure; rhythmic variation in "bridge became a limb, then a twig" mirrors narrowing stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; "village swayed like a single breathing organism" avoids purple prose; final line's "scent she would never chase" achieves density without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Risk-taking (olfactory POV) heightens stakes; corpse flower's carrion promise transformed into "quiet heart" feels inevitable through prior scent logic, avoiding quirky ornament.</comment>
