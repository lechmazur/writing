<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("palimpsest promise tingled") but final renunciation of identity as coachman earns visible cost; girl functions as symbol rather than character, limiting relationship depth despite strong micro-choices like threading the needle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly when river vanishes and coachman walks "no longer coachman," with conceptual cost of erased identity; escalation lacks explicit pressure buildup under Accumulative lens—gutters stopping triggers change but feels externally imposed rather than protagonist-driven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fog-bound river crossing constrains every choice (walking invisible plank, dissolving coach) and charges the final image as meadow; micro-setting of yarn needle directly shapes the climax by stitching through absence, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving narrative essence against silence) tightens meaningfully when gutters stop, forcing distillation; cost of identity loss is felt but not viscerally dramatized during the key thread-pulling beat under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (distilling stories into droplet) without moralizing; final image reweights "complexity into essence" as the coachman carries distilled stories, offering resonant non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("raw-knuckled hands," "steam rises through ambient awareness") sustains poetic rhythm under pressure; minor register drift in "percolated through ambient awareness" slightly clashes with coachman’s voice but remains purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density falters with one paraphrase loop ("memories percolate through ambient awareness" echoes earlier "steam rises through ambient awareness"), dulling immediacy in a high-pressure beat; no closure artifacts but scaffold reduces momentum by 0.2.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of storytelling as physical distillation feels inevitable; risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens stakes, though "palimpsest promise" edges toward familiar mythic tropes without full transformation.</comment>
