<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lyra's trembling hand versus urgent encoding; embodied emotion ("tasting metal") avoids therapy-speak. Echo confrontation crystallizes her fear of erasure versus need to release, making the final renunciation of the bolt plate feel earned with visible cost in the thunder's arrival.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orientation clear by 50 words (misty courtyard above clouds, bolt plate shield). Accumulative lens holds through density escalation (vines to bioluminescent moths), with Charged Poise closure where thunder's resonance deepens colors while ghost settles—a felt cost legible in "pastel to anthem" and copper plate singing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Flower press bolt plate functions as micro-setting: constrains choices (crushing petals into pigment) and charges closure (empty plate rattling "rhythm against her spine"). Sensory specificity avoids cliché—"phosphor moths ticking binary lullabies" and "ozone until air felt like chord unresolved" embody the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten under accumulative lens: "before thunder rolls over them" becomes urgent when echo manifests, narrowing Lyra's option to faster encoding. Agency-driven escalation culminates in moths' manifestation, with cost unmistakable in thunder's vibration altering the bolt plate's resonance and graffiti's transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—petals as "unspoken needs," glyph as "listening ear"—avoiding moralizing. Final image (child seeing "I am lonely too" without flinching) offers non-literal answer to articulation's purpose, reweighting Lyra's initial fear through communal belonging.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful: "droplet of vapor a note," "4/4 heartbeat sonar" filter world through Lyra's artistry. Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure ("cerulean smear... door if squinted through tears"), with no head-hopping despite dual Lyras. Voice remains singular even during echo confrontation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion—"static that lived between lightning and thunder" recurs with purposeful variation. Minor paraphrase loop ("driftingly alert" repetition) prevents 9.5, but final image ("rattling rhythm... hearts learning to admit beating") achieves crystalline density without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "ghost in code" into bioluminescent moths manifesting suppressed longing—a fresh synthesis where technical metaphor (binary lullabies) serves emotional truth. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; bolt plate's evolution from shield to empty sigh feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
