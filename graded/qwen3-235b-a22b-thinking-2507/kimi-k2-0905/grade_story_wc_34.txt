<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (encoding unspoken needs) but interiority leans abstract ("loneliness" as glyph) over embodied contradiction; echo confrontation lacks sufficient micro-choice escalation to fully earn the release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds (glyph of listening ear crystallizing belonging), but escalation lacks meaningful tightening under Accumulative lens; thunder's arrival feels inevitable rather than pressured by Lyra's agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting (flower press bolt plate) constrains choice (crushing petals into pigment) and charges closure (empty plate rattling); scent of roses mixing with ozone creates irreplaceable sensory pressure for the final release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes (articulating needs before thunder) deepen credibly, but conflict remains atmospheric rather than visceral; the echo's accusation adds tension yet resolves without sufficient trade-off or tactical cost to Lyra's methods.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through glyph reconfiguration (open mouth as listening ear), avoiding moralizing; child's "I am lonely too" delivers resonant, non-literal answer, though "belonging might occur" slightly over-articulates the insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("droplet of vapor a note") and rhythmic control excel under pressure; "tinkersong wonder" diction stays voice-motivated, though "hush before thunder answered the sky's white quill" risks lyrical opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("petals crushed into pigment"), but figurative stacking in climax ("cerulean smear... looked like a door") risks muddling immediacy; no loops, yet "binary lullabies" slightly overwrites the moth manifestation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Synthesis of storm-light graffiti and bioluminescent moths transforms loneliness tropes; emotional specificity in child's reaction avoids sentimentality, though echo-as-internal-conflict feels slightly derivative despite fresh execution.</comment>
