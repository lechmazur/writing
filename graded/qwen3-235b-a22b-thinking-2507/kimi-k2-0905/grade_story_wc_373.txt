<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("false starts of courage") and embodied emotion ("tail digging half-moons") avoid therapy-speak; the final renunciation of trust is earned by waiting's visible cost—fist opening at dawn—without sentimental resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: the "small wet click" reweights trust's corrosion with undeniable conceptual cost, under an Accumulative/Textural lens where waiting tightens pressure through rising tide and bruising sky.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The pirate market's micro-setting (sinking crates, licking water) actively pressures choices; the mermaid fob constrains the climax and charges the final image—"gutted fish" drop—making environment indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: the live sunrise clock narrows options as tide rises, culminating in the felt cost of betrayal when the fob "flicked once like a fish gutted on deck," reconfiguring trust's value.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the fob's evolution—from truce token to betrayal proof—avoiding moralizing; the final line ("emptied of a weight I had mistaken for love") offers non-literal resolution without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("comforting unease," "liquid night") and rhythmic control under pressure ("false starts of courage, each stride dying halfway"); syntax compresses during tension without losing voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffolding; "her tail digging half-moons into my skin" edges toward mannered density but avoids muddle, while the "wet click" crystallizes closure with surgical precision—only a hairline slip prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Risk-taking (recording trust breaking as sound) transforms pirate trope through specific emotional calculus; the fob's irreversible trade feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
