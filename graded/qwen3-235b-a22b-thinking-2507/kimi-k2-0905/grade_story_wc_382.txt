<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "agreed upon lies" ritual, but tutor's non-living status lacks sufficient foreshadowing to fully motivate her vanishing; narrator's embodied shift to "new linguist" carries visible cost through the seal's weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: steam spelling "stay" crystallizes the cost of becoming the building's keeper under Accumulative lens; orientation anchors immediately with meteor signature and rosemary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rooftop garden functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice (weighing "like ill-fitting crown"); jasmine-scented sugar charges the final image while reflecting architectural memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through narrator's agency: pressing seal to gargoyle narrows options to becoming keeper; cost crystallizes in "weight of every story" when tutor vanishes, reconfiguring the sugar ritual's meaning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "agreed upon lies" reweights from tea ritual to architectural truth-telling; final steam image answers loneliness without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct ("meteors fell in Latin hexameter"); compression taught early via "dead language tutor" premise; psychic distance modulates flawlessly from ritual to revelation without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "stone grinding like drawer opening" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor register drift in "polite erasure" risks abstraction but gains specificity through "cracked brick" context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms architectural personification via "language of old buildings" frame; "agreed upon lies" synthesizes human/structural loneliness into fresh emotional calculus without safety-hedging.</comment>
