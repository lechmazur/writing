<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses ("calm outside, quake within") and earned closure—dismantling lies with visceral cost ("lighter and ancient")—anchor her motivation. Riga’s thin characterization slightly dilutes relationship pressure despite functional secondary role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara’s decision to continue exposing lies carries undeniable conceptual cost ("wake spreading like a sentence"). Accumulative lens holds; cost proof crystallizes in "hindsight clarity arrived not as lightning but as tide."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The sundial as micro-setting constrains choices (coordinate discovery) and charges the final image ("absence as a new kind of weight"). Canal reeds actively hide the bunker, altering tactics—meeting Q3 9+ gate with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mara’s agency: cross-checking coordinates forces irreversible choice. Stakes tighten via concrete cost ("architecture of lies crumbled beam by beam"), with moral calculus (truth vs. inherited identity) sharpening the climax during journal reading.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: erased log entries and sacrificed platoon reconfigure "lies" as architecture. Final image ("wake spreading like a sentence") answers the central question without moralizing—pure resonance via concrete action, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mara reads "smudge of erased ink the way sailors read wind." Rhythmic control under pressure ("discrepancy rang like a cracked bell") sustains Accumulative lens. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance modulates perfectly with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; peak beats avoid figurative muddle ("pages trembling in breeze" conveys cost without overwriting). Final line recharges motif with precision ("sundial’s absence as a new kind of weight"), elevating closure without drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of historical investigation and personal reckoning: "morning radio silence" as temporal motif transforms war-legacy tropes. Emotional specificity ("creature newly born yet full of sediment") avoids generality, with risk-taking (lyric structure) heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
