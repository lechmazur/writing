<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("calm outside, quake within") and embodied emotion ("pages trembling in breeze") drive micro-choices under pressure; Riga’s sparse presence applies pressure without diluting focus on Mara’s earned renunciation of inherited lies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: "understanding the architecture of lies was not an ending; it was scaffolding she now knew how to dismantle," with visceral cost ("lighter and ancient, a creature newly born yet full of sediment"); Accumulative lens holds through erased log entries to final wake image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Twilight barge canal functions as active constraint (fog enabling stealth approach, reeds concealing bunker); sundial as recurring object charges closure when returned to crate, making time’s "score" tangible against the canal’s "scar."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mara’s agency tracing log discrepancies to coordinate discovery; single tightening forecloses path when journals confirm sacrifice, with cost legible in "architecture of lies crumbled beam by beam" amid physical tremors.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Final image ("wake spreading like a sentence spoken at last") resonates non-literally with the central question, avoiding moralizing while reweighting "serene upheaval" into actionable truth-telling without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("smudge of erased ink the way sailors read wind") with rhythmic control under pressure; controlled third-person avoids filter verbs while modulating cadence from reflective ("serene upheaval") to urgent ("She traced the numbers").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "serene upheaval" motif evolves organically across beats without muddle; final line’s "new kind of weight" pays off sundial symbolism with propulsion, though "thoughtfully clear" repetition slightly dilutes density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms war-legacy trope via concrete mechanisms (sundial tooth-marks, log palimpsests); risk-taking in quiet closure where truth-seeking continues, with emotional specificity ("lighter and ancient") avoiding generic templates.</comment>
