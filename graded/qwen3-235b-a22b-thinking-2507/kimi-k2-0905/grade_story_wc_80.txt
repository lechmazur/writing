<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's internal conflict between certifying structures and preserving abandoned dreams is embodied in her physical actions—sealing confessions into fissures—showing contradictory impulses (preserving vs. erasing) without abstraction. The final choice to walk away earns closure with visible cost: inkwell lighter "by exactly the amount of a confession." Slight deduction as the keystone moment lacks sharper tension between her roles.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Mara’s ascent crystallizes the thematic reweighting of "separations as foundations," with cost legible in the inkwell’s weight shift. Orientation is immediate (drawbridge rising, lagoon setting), lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density escalation (fissures deepening to keystone void), and no causality breaks. Hairline slip: tide’s "scheduled betrayal" lacks explicit engineer pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Submerged pavilion functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (water depth dictates access, fissures enable confessions) and charges closure (future scholars coring "repaired stone"). "Hushed blaze" tone is woven through tactile details like "boots kissing wet marble," avoiding static description. Minor deduction: "moonlit ribs" slightly abstract compared to concrete lagoon physics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (preserving abandoned dreams vs. engineering demands) tightens through Mara’s agency: each fissure deepens emotional investment until the keystone void. Cost is unmistakable—"inkwell lighter by exactly the amount of a confession"—reconfiguring her mission. Escalation driven entirely by protagonist choices under Accumulative lens, though tide’s role as pressure could be more viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "stitching a wound shut with thread made of light" shows rather than states the cost of preserving ephemera. Final image of future scholars finding fragments offers resonant answer to "what endures?" without moralizing. Avoids all anti-patterns; "hushed blaze" metaphor reweights the pavilion’s absence as legacy, not loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("gull cried she winced as if from inside her chest") and rhythmic control under pressure—short sentences for tension ("She waded through the nave"), lyrical flow for reflection—exemplify voice mastery. No head-hopping; free indirect style ("she understood separations were foundations") seamlessly blends thought/action. Patterned elision (past trauma) taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line multiplies meaning: "dripping canal water like a reluctant farewell" establishes tone and motif in 6 words. Figurative language ("thread made of light") serves theme without muddle. Final line recharges opening imagery ("drowned pavilion" vs. "lagoon’s skin") with crystalline propulsion. Hairline slip: "stoically sensitive communion" slightly abstract for peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms familiar tropes (submerged ruins, lone surveyor) through concrete details: hydraulic lime repairs, "interlaced absence" as structural/psychological concept. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes—single descent/ascent arc crystallizes into Charged Poise—without gimmickry. Avoids derivative premise via specificity: "oil-paper confessions" feel irreplaceable, not symbolic convenience.</comment>
