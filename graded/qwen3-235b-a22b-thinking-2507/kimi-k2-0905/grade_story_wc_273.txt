<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "serene anger crystallized into determination" then transforming to acceptance; micro-choices like vial use earn Lyra's vanishing as conscious choice with visible cost in final dissolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: "time's elasticity was not a curse but a gift" reweights premise with undeniable cost (vanishing) under Accumulative lens; ink patterns accumulate to crystallize meaning without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sandstone isn't backdrop—it enables ink patterns that constrain choices; final image of "walls holding memory of ink" charges closure with environmental specificity that reweights time's nature.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation via deepening: ink patterns evolve from bootprint to hourglass to portal, narrowing options as Kael realizes Lyra chose to vanish; cost crystallizes in "anger transformed into acceptance" before stepping through.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action—stepping into ink reframes crisis as gift—without moralizing; final line's "moments to choose who we become" resonates as non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct ("pink eyes narrowing," "gloved finger tracing"); rhythm modulates under stress with purposeful compression ("drone dive-bombed into the ink portal") without elision artifacts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "time stretched like taffy" and "fractal spirals" show high density without muddle; final line's "fish through water" metaphor charges closure with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms time-slowing trope via desert's "defense mechanism" logic; "conscious wildness" synthesizes character and physics into bold risk that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
