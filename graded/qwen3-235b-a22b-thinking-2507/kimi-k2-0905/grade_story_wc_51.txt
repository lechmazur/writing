<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied actions (blood drop, breath alignment) but the climax confession lacks contradictory impulses; motivation is clear though the "heaviest stone" surrender feels inevitable rather than wrestled with under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully—the grotto unfolding after confession reconfigures options with visceral cost (blood, hollow chest)—and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly through density escalation toward the violet flame.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The bronze grotto’s shingled walls constrain movement and perception, directly charging the final image (sister’s face in reflections); sensory details like "auric note" and "moth-wing sheets" evolve causally with the calcification process.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the grotto’s resistance (silence growing heavy, lamp sputtering), narrowing options to one irreversible choice; cost is unmistakable as her blood fuels the violet flame and reshapes the weave.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the amber threads and hollow chest—no moralizing—while the final image (sister’s forgiving face in infinity) reweights sorrow with release, avoiding tidy binaries through embodied specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is immaculate ("shingled hush pressed like whalebone reverie"); rhythmic control under pressure peaks with the fragmented "she spoke aloud..." confession, taught early and paid off in the closure’s crystalline syntax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "calcifying the air into thin translucent sheets" achieves high density without muddle, and the violet flame climax propels rhythm through varied sentence structures that mirror her urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief-as-weight transforms archetypal burden tropes through fractal physics and bronze alchemy; risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
