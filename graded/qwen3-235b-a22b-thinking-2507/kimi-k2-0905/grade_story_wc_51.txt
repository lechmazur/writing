<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied choices (blood drop, breathing alignment) but lacks secondary pressure since sister remains off-page; micro-choices under stress like flame-tilting reveal hierarchy of values without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: confession's blood cost crystallizes options when violet flame illuminates infinite sister-forgiveness, making valley's "giant exhaled" consequence undeniable under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Kerosene lamp functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (solidified light sun); bronze grotto's shingled hush constrains every action, from flame-dependency to recursive reflections altering spatial tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: grotto's tightening silence forces confession, narrowing options to surrender or suffocation; cost legible in blood-on-wick and hollowed chest, reweighting burden-collection stakes under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final weave rising offers non-literal answer to "weights of burdens" theme; valley settling resonates through concrete action (no moralizing), with sister's forgiveness reframing sorrow/release balance without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shingled hush," "auric note") persists under pressure; rhythmic control shifts from lyrical density to short clauses during lamp sputter crisis, with no head-hopping in single-POV frame.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; "calcifying air into moth-wing sheets" serves dual purpose as image and plot mechanism; minor register drift in "fractal lattice" (slightly technical) doesn't obscure climax's visceral blood-drop cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms burden-tropes via specific physics (density/weightlessness of threads); "kerosene lamp as future sun" synthesizes grief into fresh, inevitable payoff that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
