<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prism-minded trait concretely manifests in spectral navigation; motivation clear but final endurance lacks contradictory impulses to hit 9+ gate. No diagnostic label-speak under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with felt cost (spent doodle, Archive's fragility); orientation anchors by 100 words. Persistent constraint (inversion clock) shapes tactics but falls just short of 9.5-band requirement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Grotto's gravity shifts actively constrain choices (e.g., indigo-path navigation); "clandestinely luminous" veins enable critical action. Final quartz-dust sigh charges closure but micro-setting (doodle) prevents 9.0 per gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Time pressure tightens meaningfully, but seed-silencing via "whisper that tasted of iron" feels slightly convenient; no visible tactical trade-off when modulating tone. Cost legible but not deepened per 8.8+ band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "combinations" as memory metaphor; final line reweights premise without moralizing ("combinations would still remember how to hide"). No thematic echo or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tasted of iron and childhood"); rhythmic control under pressure. Minor POV consistency slip in "prism-minded" repetition prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "droplets reversed, falling downward now" shows rather than tells. Slight register drift in "dormant seeds of vigilance" prevents 9.0 despite crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Gravity inversion transforms archivist trope; "manuscript margin doodle" as compass feels fresh. "Seeds of vigilance" borrows fantasy tropes without sufficient transformation for higher band.</comment>
