<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Marisol's shift from erasing to transforming grief, but "bitter almonds/copper pennies" leans generic rather than chef-specific. Final choice to pour her joy into coral feels earned through knees-buckling physicality of oceanic sorrow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost: her gift transforms from curse to "breath," yet the "unspoken dream" timeframe remains decorative. Orientation perfect ("fortress still wept" anchors instantly), but escalation lacks secondary stake to deepen pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Environment constrains every choice: glass sand dictates kneeling analysis, coral touch forces memory subsumption. Final "sturdy brittle song" charges closure by transforming the pavilion's bioluminescence into embodied theme—no generic placeholder setting here.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by Marisol's agency under Accumulative lens: her descent and palm-pressing narrow options toward the coral's oceanic grief. Cost is unmistakable in the changed gift, though the desert's ancient sorrow lacks competing human stakes for fuller tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly through concrete particulars: "sorrow that had learned to make room for new growth" avoids moralizing. Final cooking metaphor ("grief could enhance rather than overwhelm") earns resonance by tying to her poured memories—zero thematic echo in the closing line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is chef-specific: sand "bitter/sticky against the tongue," memories tasted as "copper pennies." Rhythmic control under pressure ("Her knees buckled") avoids ventriloquism, though "subsume" slightly strains her lexicon in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "tidal pool formations" evolves meaning across beats without synonym churn. Final line crystallizes theme through image ("something that might become sweet"), not abstraction. Figurative language never muddles the bioluminescent climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms memory-eater trope through geological scale and cooking metaphor. Risk-taking (oceanic grief dwarfing human sorrow) heightens stakes coherently, though the "unspoken dream" framing feels underutilized for full originality.</comment>
