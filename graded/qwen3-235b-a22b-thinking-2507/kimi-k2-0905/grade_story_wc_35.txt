<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied ("tasting the memory of every soul"), but single-character scope limits relationship dynamics. Final renunciation (reversing gift to give memories) earns closure through prior causality, though "small and bright and brief" slightly risks sentimentality without sufficient counterweight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost: "tasting not the bitter accumulation...something that might become sweet" crystallizes the shift. Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly as memory density transforms grief into fertile ground, with cost legible in the gift's irreversible change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Desert and coral aren't backdrop but active constraints—tidal pool sand patterns dictate Marisol's analysis method, and the pavilion's bioluminescence directly charges the final image where "coral responded, its bioluminescence shifting." Micro-setting (sand, coral) shapes every choice and the ending's transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Marisol's agency: her decision to "pour her own memories" into the coral reconfigures the dominant conflict (human vs. geological grief) with felt cost (altered gift). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens as emotional contagion forces a single, decisive deepening that forecloses forgetting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the coral's amber shift and "polished by slow friction of time," rejecting tidy morals. Final image—"sorrow that could shelter life"—resonantly answers the central question without stating a thesis, avoiding the "Thematic Echo" penalty through concrete sensory payoff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is immaculate: "tasting memories through touch" filters all description through gustatory synesthesia ("bitter almonds," "copper pennies"). Rhythmic control under pressure ("Her knees buckled under the weight of stored remorse") shows voice modulating with emotional intensity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high-density prose like "sand turned to glass by centuries of sun" advances character and atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language ("fortress still wept") remains coherent in peak beats, though "million-year cycles" slightly risks abstraction without immediate sensory tether.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms "memory-taster" trope through desert/coral symbiosis—grief as geological process feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking (non-human memory scale) heightens stakes without gimmickry, with "polished by slow friction of time" offering a non-obvious synthesis that redefines sorrow's purpose.</comment>
