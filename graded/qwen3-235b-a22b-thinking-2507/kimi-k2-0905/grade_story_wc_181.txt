<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara’s "stomach lurching as pages tore away" while pursuing knowledge, but "philosophical breakthrough" labels verge on diagnostic-speak during high-stakes bathroom scene, slightly unearthing epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing ("The curator is the catalog") with undeniable cost—erased kindnesses visible in "pages vanished from the book of her past"—under a Hybrid lens where causal chains and textural density cohere to the final footnote.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The pistachio shell cameo constrains choice (whispering questions, pressing to drain) and charges the closure image as it "germinates into a new asteroid," transforming micro-setting into indispensable narrative engine.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when plucking galaxy-fruits erases past kindnesses, making Mara’s agency palpable in racing to the bathroom; cost is unmistakable though the "command" origin slightly softens causal escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Final image ("a gentle warning printed in starlight") reweights the central question non-literally by framing knowledge as "inherited backwards," avoiding moralizing while embracing thematic complexity through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in "petals that chimed like tuning forks," but "brightened disquiet" repetition and slight register drift during bathroom epiphany weaken rhythmic control under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density falters in bathroom scene’s template cadence ("stared at... realized... lifted"), creating a paraphrase loop; no closure damage but momentum dips where syntax uniformity dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Nonlinear inheritance reimagined as "simply complicated love" synthesizes cosmic and familial stakes with emotional specificity; the pistachio shell cameo’s transformation from blank to catalog avoids derivative tropes through lived detail.</comment>
