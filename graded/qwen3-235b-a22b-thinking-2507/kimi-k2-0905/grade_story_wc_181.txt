<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lira’s "excitement sharpened by dread" and her refusal to carve the shell despite "surged" motivation, but her "forbidden knowledge" drive lacks sufficient pre-climax embodiment beyond Quell’s notes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: leaving the shell uncarved forecloses her path with visible cost (salt-sweet taste of choices, dissolving lineage graft), while the orchard’s transformation charges the final image under a clear Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The astral orchard’s "nebulae-swirling outhouse" functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (bathroom breakthroughs enabling the climax), though "copper-leaved graft" details occasionally verge on ornamental without pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lira’s agency when she inquires of the mirror, narrowing options to carve or refuse; cost is unmistakable in the dissolving shell’s taste, but "nonlinear inheritance" concept could heighten pressure earlier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the shell’s refusal—inheritance as pruned choice, not destiny—with the "cameo of silence" offering resonant, non-literal closure that reweights Quell’s "simply complicated" truth without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "starlight-dappled petals that hummed like tuning forks" and rhythmic control under pressure ("sunlight on a scalpel"), though Quell’s "simply complicated" line risks thematic echo in a pivotal beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-zero loops with high density ("plasma lighter, flames neon pink, the color of correction fluid"), but "simply complicated" diagnosis-speak in Quell’s dialogue creates a minor thematic artifact in the climax beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of bathroom epiphanies with cosmic stakes feels inevitable; burning "wet ink and regret" for neon correction fluid transforms tropes through specific, lived-in choices that heighten emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
