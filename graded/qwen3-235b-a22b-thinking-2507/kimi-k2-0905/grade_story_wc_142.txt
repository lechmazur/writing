<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lina’s embodied contradiction ("dual allegiance prickled") and micro-choices (painting the stone symbol, dangling the chip) reveal values under pressure without therapy-speak; the stone chip’s tactile use across beats grounds her conflict in character-specific struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the inspectors’ retreat and Lina’s "rehearsed new choreography" crystallize options with undeniable conceptual cost ("privatization postponed... capital would return"), satisfying Accumulative/Textural lens escalation through density shifts in the reorganization beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The raft city’s micro-setting constrains every choice (swapping barges, paint-based resistance), culminating in the final image where the carnival’s unreadability charges survival; "dissolving rice paper" prizes directly alter tactics under gentrification pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Lina’s agency: the Syndicate’s threat narrows options to the midnight reorganization, with visible cost in the inspectors’ confusion and the stone chip’s reweighted meaning ("bell that tolled only for her"), tightening stakes through her tactical choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (graffiti codes, rice-paper prizes), avoiding moralizing; the final "we are still becoming" symbol reweights resistance as continuous becoming, offering resonant non-literal answer to cultural survival without stated morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("corporate teal, surveyors’ orange") and rhythmic control under pressure ("calliope wheezed its chord"); minor register drift in "negotiable gravity" slightly dilutes stress-response authenticity but remains voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-zero loops with high propulsion ("children who sold them spoke only in riddles"), but slight density muddle in "keep the dark from remembering land prices" in a high-pressure beat edges toward abstractness without full tactile grounding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of gentrification resistance through carnival logic (graffiti as communication, poetry prizes); transforms familiar themes via specific, non-obvious choices like "eight ball slots" roulette, with risk-taking heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
