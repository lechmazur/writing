<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lina’s contradictory impulses (preserve vs. survive) manifest concretely in the graffiti symbol and stone chip handling; secondary characters lack sufficient pressure despite the fire-eater’s burning "reclaim" moment elevating stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "privatization had merely been postponed" crystallizes the cost while the reorganization proves agency; orientation is immediate ("drowned coast"), and the accumulative lens holds through sensory escalation to the dissolving rice paper prizes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The foundation stone chip constrains every key choice—from comfort object to debate catalyst—and charges the final image ("dangled like a bell"); setting details like "corporate teal" actively filter Lina’s perception and tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Lina’s agency (painting the symbol, proposing reorganization), but the Syndicate threat remains abstract—no visceral narrowing of options beyond "bigger barges," weakening cost legibility despite the felt postponement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the stone chip’s evolution and "we are still becoming" graffiti; the final image reweights gentrification as ongoing performance without moralizing, avoiding all anti-patterns like thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("calliope music ricocheted like gulls fighting for bread") and rhythmic control shine, but the Chinese phrase "投射的火花" creates a slight register drift in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; "fresh enamel, corporate teal" exemplifies textural specificity, though "hopeful desperation flickering like投射的火花" muddles the metaphor with mixed imagery in the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gentrification through floating carnival logic (dissolving rice paper poems, soup circle); risks like the stone chip’s Charged Poise payoff feel inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
