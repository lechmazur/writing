<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lira’s claustrophobia vs. hunger for silence, embodied through micro-choices (stepping three planks, whispering names). Pruner’s trade lacks sufficient prior tension to fully charge the cost of memory loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: releasing silences reconfigures the premise with visceral cost (leaving the doll, lungs unfolding). Orientation anchors within 100 words; gravity inversion’s timeframe creates urgent causality under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Xenial trellis functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choices (planks yielding to trust, root contact) and charges the final image. "Gilded hush" transcends atmosphere to become a tactile, flavor-based pressure point throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Lira’s agency—each silence encounter narrows options until the membrane crossing. Cost is unmistakable: memory traded, doll abandoned, lungs stretched. Pruner’s introduction slightly softens pressure without sufficient prior foreshadowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: collecting silences becomes liberation through release. Final image of the doll as "porcelain chrysalis" reweights the premise without moralizing, embodying the story’s core question about containment vs. freedom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tasted of iron doors sealing," "planks yielded like memory") modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control in the membrane-crossing beat elevates tension. Minor register drift in "xenial" usage slightly distances voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with high information density; "gilded hush" refrain avoids loop through evolving context. Slight scaffold in "tasted of the silence that follows a last breath" followed by "tasting the ordinary hush" dilutes momentum in final beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of claustrophobia and sensory silence collection feels inevitable. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; "flavors of silence" transforms abstract fear into tangible, embodied metaphor throughout.</comment>
