<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids labels ("contracted walls of her lungs"), embodied through doll interactions and step-by-step trust. Contradictory impulses (fear vs. curiosity) drive choices, but keeper trade lacks sufficient friction for full 9.0. Final renunciation earned by accumulated silences with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands decisively: releasing silences instead of collecting final one carries conceptual cost ("carry the bunker inside her forever"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly; "faint click of porcelain" crystallizes irreversible change with felt weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Xenial trellis constrains every choice (planks yielding to trust, warming guidance) and charges final image ("trembled, xenial no longer"). Doll functions as micro-setting—porcelain throat stores silence, becoming chrysalis. 9+ gate passed via environmental pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collecting silences to heal claustrophobia) tightens through agency: limiting steps, trading memory, rejecting final silence. Cost is unmistakable—"lungs wide" yet returning to bunker. Escalation driven purely by protagonist’s choices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: releasing silences reweights "stretched sky in every breath" without moralizing. Final image ("faint click of porcelain") offers resonant answer to central question. Avoids all anti-patterns—complexity in "flawless silence" = carrying bunker forever.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "tasting silence that follows a last breath" filters world through Lira’s trauma. Rhythmic control under pressure ("planks yielded like memory... then firmed into certainty") modulates with emotional stakes. Zero head-hopping; voice remains anchored.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "gilded hush coated the air, thick as honey yet weightless" does triple duty. Figurative language intensifies without muddle—"membrane clung, stretching her skin" during peak tension. One near-duplicate stem ("sprouted... bloomed") prevents 9.5.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms claustrophobia trope via "collecting silence flavors" conceit. Gravity inversion isn’t gimmick—it enables core metaphor (silences as tangible). Risk distinction (+0.4) for making silence tactile; "xenial" redefinition deepens stakes without abstraction.</comment>
