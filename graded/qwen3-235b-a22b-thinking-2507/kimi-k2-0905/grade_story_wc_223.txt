<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses (preserving memory vs. survival) drive micro-choices like the lace noose vow; Kestrel’s shift from rehearsed blankness to vulnerable query feels earned. Slight deduction for "benevolently ruthless" stated but not deeply tested in action under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: the "luminous absence of gunfire" crystallizes memory’s fragility against impending erasure. Accumulative lens holds via escalating density (Kestrel’s entry deepening memory’s stakes), but one tightening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (chessboard missing pawns) constrains choices and charges the final image—Mara wrapping it with "gaps only the living could fill." Body (walking patterns spelling words) and tool (lace noose) directly shape tactics and closure’s emotional weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens: Kestrel’s intrusion narrows Mara’s options (trust or flee), forcing the "Adel" spelling with visible cost—the rifle’s muzzle on the pawn’s square. Dominant stake (memory vs. silence) deepens via protagonist’s agency in micro-choices, not empty intensifiers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the chessboard’s missing pawns and "wingbone" alphabet reweight memory’s cost without moralizing. Final image (overlapping footsteps shaping unreadable words) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to erasure, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mara’s stress narrows attention to textures ("carved mane sharp against her palm"). Voice modulates under pressure—sparse dialogue carries subtext ("Tell me the name..."), and rhythm accelerates during tension without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("heel-toe-pause-toe-heel" conveys ritual without redundancy). Figurative language ("stone throats softening consonants") enhances pressure in peak beats. Final line’s cadence shift ("ready to unbind the next small truth") charges closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms crisis-actor trope through specific stakes: Mara’s "nomadic penumbra" reframes memory as embodied resistance. Risk-taking (accumulative structure) heightens coherence—Kestrel’s vulnerability feels earned, not gimmicky, with closure’s shadow-walking synthesis.</comment>
