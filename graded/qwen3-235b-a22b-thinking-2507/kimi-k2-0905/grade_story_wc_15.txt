<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied choices (bleeding onto orchids) and contradictory impulses (surrender vs. stitching), though slight abstraction in "canyon stitching him forward" edges toward poetic vagueness. Motivation to mend broken precedents intensifies credibly to the palm-pricking climax, with visible cost in the loom's dissolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the returning tide with salt-incompatible orchids reconfigures ruin into reverence with undeniable conceptual cost ("loom sank beneath the tide"). Accumulative lens holds throughout, though the sewing escalation feels marginally abrupt before the blood sacrifice tightens stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Red canyon walls and driftwood loom actively constrain choices (path crumbling into cavern) and charge the final image (orchids blooming where tide returns). The illustration plate's porcelain dissolving into shell fulfills the 9+ gate by making environment indispensable to closure's transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Calyx's agency: pricking his palm bleeds "hauntingly optimistic" red to bloom orchids, paying a visible price that alters tactics (loom turns autonomously). Escalation under Accumulative lens is impeccable, with the blood sacrifice narrowing options toward the whispered finale.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—"every unraveling is only the first half of a weave"—without moralizing. The final orchid-laden tide offers a resonant, non-literal answer to broken precedents, avoiding sentimentality while charging the horizon with renewal after surrender.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("canyon exhaled centuries of salt") and rhythmic control peak during sewing ("piercing porcelain with silvered needle, muttering couplets"). Elision (dream logic) is taught early and pays off in the glowing footprints, with no head-hopping marring the single-POV intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-perfect propulsion: "Each stitch released a memory" compresses exposition into visceral action. Minor deduction for one near-loop ("overlapping sleepwalking paths" repetition), but zero figurative muddle in the blood-sewing climax, where syntax accelerates with urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms labyrinth tropes through specific, lived detail (kelp threads in loom, orchid solace scent). Risk-taking—lyric structure as conflict escalation—heightens stakes coherently, with the salt-incompatible orchids proving an inevitable, non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
