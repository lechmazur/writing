<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: guilt-driven quest vs. realization she fuels the system. Micro-choice slicing paper chain reveals hierarchy of values (voice over silence). No diagnostic labels; embodied "static" in chest. Final choice earned through causal chain, but secondary pressure absent as solo character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: releasing insect completes lullaby, static softens into meteor hush—cost (voice for silence) legible in "collarbone quiet." Accumulative lens holds; density surge (converging letters, lullaby chorus) reweights stakes. Orientation clear by line 3 ("laboratory of lost sounds").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Amber constrains choice (tethering triggers hologram) and charges closure (empty, "clear as forgiven sleep"). Sensory hierarchy flawless: "sawdust smelled of nursery pine" reflects guilt. Micro-setting (brass stylus) enables final act—slicing chain. Meets 9+ gate via tool charging final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency: selecting RESTORE reveals firmware truth, forcing RELEASE choice. Tightening forecloses translation path; cost (voice trade) unmistakable in "cultivated them, feeding on guilt." Accumulative density surge (letters → paper chain) reweights dominant stake (silencing guilt) with conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image (empty amber = "forgiven sleep") reweights premise non-literally: guilt requires release, not erasure. Theme emerges through firmware metaphor—tattoos as "sleeper code" activating guilt. No moralizing; "Why did you leave me awake?" carries emotional truth without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: guilt "crackles like static," lullaby "sucks itself into silence." Rhythm modulates under pressure (short sentences at climax: "Time folded tighter"). Zero head-hopping; diction stays within tattooist’s lyrical lexicon ("star-maps," "crystalline prison").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "hologram wings scattered into sparks" does triple duty (action/image/theme). Figurative language serves pressure: letters "fluttered like moths" during escalation. Final line—"clear as forgiven sleep"—resolves with concrete specificity. Peak beats free of muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "haunted firmware" as guilt propagating through tattoos. Emotional truth in "Why did you leave me awake?" avoids trope. Risk-taking (accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passed—can’t swap settings without breaking logic.</comment>
