<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in embodied guilt (static-chest crackle, burning stars) drives micro-choices; contradictory impulses manifest when slicing paper chain to reject voice sacrifice. Final RELEASE choice earns renunciation through prior causality—realization the lab cultivates guilt—without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: empty amber and quiet collarbone crystallize cost with visceral legibility. Orientation anchors by line 3 ("laboratory of lost sounds"); Accumulative lens holds via density escalation (letters fluttering like moths, hologram wings unfolding). Cost proof: "collarbone quiet at last" forecloses guilt’s dissonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (amber insect, brass stylus) constrains choices and charges closure: tethering triggers hologram, dissolution completes lullaby, emptiness symbolizes forgiven sleep. "Meteor hush" evolves from opening texture to dawn’s soundless resolution, avoiding static description through causal pressure on guilt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: selecting RESTORE deepens stakes (revealing her tattoos as "sleeper code"), then RELEASE reconfigures options. Cost unmistakable—"amber now empty, clear as forgiven sleep"—reweights prior guilt through conceptual sacrifice without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: unfinished lullaby → completed notes → "forgiven sleep" reweights guilt without moralizing. Final image ("collarbone quiet") offers resonant answer to "Why did you leave me awake?" via conceptual repricing—silence as release, not erasure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in guilt-filtered details ("stars burned," "static-chest crackle"); rhythmic control under pressure ("sliced the paper chain") avoids uniform tics. Slight register drift in "pure tonal ache" barely nudges against 9.0, but voice modulation sustains coherence through climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density with propulsion ("drawers sighed open," "notes sucking themselves into silence"). "Tonal ache" risks abstraction but earns specificity through lab’s translators; final line ("clear as forgiven sleep") crystallizes closure without muddle. Near-flawless linecraft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis: constellation tattoos as "haunted firmware" transforms grief into systemic critique. Risk-taking (laboratory as guilt-cultivator) heightens stakes coherently; emotional specificity ("lullaby backward") avoids template tropes while feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
