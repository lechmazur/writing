<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion (frost-bite chill, heartbeat tempo) but lacks contradictory impulses in peak action; Mara's grief/fear/wonder progression feels tidy without irrational layering during fork-striking.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the conservatory's thawing in fifths reconfigures silence's meaning with conceptual cost (sound's impossibility accepted), while the child's treble clef cloud proves Mara's translation lives beyond her departure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Winterglass dome constrains every choice (frost as canvas, thermal resonance as medium) and charges the final image; "diamond dust" glass crunch and melting frost become tactile extensions of Mara's emotional arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten as Mara maps emotions, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven narrowing of options; pressure builds through accumulation alone without a visible cost during the critical translation sequence (e.g., scanner failure or emotional resistance).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through thermal symphony's physicality ("liquid notes," "frost thawing in fifths"), avoiding moralizing; final image answers "is the world silent?" with the child's treble clef cloud—a resonant, non-literal proof of enduring music.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sub-zero chill bite," "silent clouds like unplayed chords") modulates with tension; no head-hopping, though "silently expressive" label risks therapy-speak in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Virtuosic rhythm ("boots crunching on diamond dust," "weep sheets of melted frost") with zero loops; minor deduction for "silently expressive" as label-only trait during audience silhouettes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "sound loss" trope via thermal translation—specific, irreplaceable physics (heat-map scanner, frost resonance) creates fresh emotional stakes where generic silence wouldn't suffice.</comment>
