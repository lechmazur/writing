<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's survivor guilt and embodied motivation drive credible choices, but emotional progression ("fear in jagged red spikes") occasionally abstracts state rather than layering contradictory impulses through specific action under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost ("capsizing that had once ended her career now began her masterpiece"), the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through thermal density escalation, and orientation anchors by line 3 without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory constrains every choice (frost blocking sound, dome capturing thermal residue) and charges the final image (thawing in perfect fifths), while the tuning fork case functions as essential micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mara's agency-driven deepening (fork sequences altering emotional mapping), narrowing options until the conservatory's transformation reweights silence's meaning with visible cost in her reborn purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—thermal song as "dialect of heat and light"—with the final image ("silence, properly mapped, could still make the soul dance") offering resonant non-literal resolution without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("diamond dust of shattered glass," "breath forming silent clouds") modulates rhythm under pressure, with consistent free indirect style and no head-hopping despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "percussion constellations" and "liquid notes" achieve high density without muddle, while final line's cadence crystallizes the conceptual repricing with surgical precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic science and thermal artistry transforms post-silence tropes; "thermal song" premise feels inevitable through specific, lived detail rather than conceptual gimmickry.</comment>
