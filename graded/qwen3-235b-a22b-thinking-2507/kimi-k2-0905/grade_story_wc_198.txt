<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is vividly embodied ("reed flutter like a trapped moth," throat raw), but lacks contradictory impulses in peak beats; final choice earned though micro-choices under pressure remain underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis with undeniable cost (distorted dewdrop reflections), lens (Accumulative/Textural) held throughout; only missing persistent constraint shaping tactics to breach 9.5.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Saxophone bell and prism atrium function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory hierarchy perfectly reflects urgency ("dewdrops like tiny crystal balls rolling off").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when prophecy "pushed harder," but escalation leans slightly on atmospheric pressure rather than protagonist agency; cost (fraying vested hush) legible yet not fully exploited.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars ("war bride’s telegram," "child’s red ball"); final image reweights prophecy’s power without moralizing, avoiding all thematic anti-patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("notes folded into overtones, overtones into silence"), but "eerie nostalgia" repetition creates minor voice convergence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but paraphrase loop in dewdrop descriptions ("Dewdrops form faster... Dewdrops form a final necklace") slightly dulls closure momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prophecy-as-music avoids abstraction; "negative space" transforms trope through specific acoustic stakes, though risk-taking stays within lyrical safety.</comment>
