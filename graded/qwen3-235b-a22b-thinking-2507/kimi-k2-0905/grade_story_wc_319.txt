<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (homesickness vs. ritual endurance) drive the renunciation; the cost of carrying "neither pendant nor answer" is viscerally embodied in erasing paw prints. Final insight emerges from concrete action, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: stepping "without stepping through" crystallizes stakes with undeniable cost in "expanded boundary of light she now wore like a second fur." Accumulative lens holds through ritual repetition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Frozen garden actively constrains choices—rosemary brittle as parchment guides movement, misty lucidity becomes a "shawl" of acceptance. Micro-setting (frost, pendant warmth) charges the final image where edges soften into companionship.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through agency-driven ritual: each offering/retraction accumulates like "frost upon frost," culminating in refusal to cross. Cost is palpable in erased paw prints and "carrying neither pendant nor answer," narrowing options irrevocably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action ("interiorized exteriors," pendant's Morse code), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights uncertainty as companion with "footfalls the soft sound of stories," resonating without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is character-particular: "breath crystallizing into suspended commas" filters world through cataloguer's past. Voice modulates perfectly from lyrical ("foggy lucidity") to visceral ("crunch of paw prints became turning pages").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence multiplies meaning. "Frost upon frost" deepens stakes while "moon's reflection in ice became illuminated initial" charges closure. No figurative muddle—prose crystallizes pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms library trope through "dimensional homesickness" and light-as-currency. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes: uncertainty's "footfalls" reconfigure knowledge as living process, not static truth.</comment>
