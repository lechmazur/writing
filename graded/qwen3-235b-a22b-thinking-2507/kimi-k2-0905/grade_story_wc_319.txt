<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "paw—no, her hand" and "waiting within questions," with embodied cost in ice-preserved rose interaction. Cultist's underdevelopment as off-page figure slightly weakens secondary pressure, but core motivation to befriend uncertainty remains vividly earned through tactile choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "waiting had become indistinguishable from being" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost of dissolving identity. Orientation established instantly in frozen garden; Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly through density buildup to final snowflake-words image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Frozen rose actively constrains choice (paw/hand shift) and charges final image as "she became the frozen rose." Micro-setting details like "iron and old parchment" taste transform environment into thematic pressure point without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: licking sundial reconfigures "boundaries of light" from abstract to embodied cost. "To wait was not to pause but to attend" deepens conflict into irreversible stance crystallization with palpable conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "interiorizing exteriors" isn't stated but demonstrated via rose's ice preservation. Final snowflake-words image reweights central question without moralizing, avoiding all thematic pitfalls through sensory particularity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is extraordinary: "breath crystallizing into tiny suspended commas" filters reality through feral/human duality. Voice modulates under pressure via cadence shifts ("She pressed her paw—no, her hand—") with zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "pendant pulsed, its sigil rotating like a compass rose that pointed nowhere" does triple duty advancing setting/character/theme. High-pressure beats maintain clarity despite lyric density ("boundaries of light now breathing with her").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms library trope through specific mechanics like "dimensionally homesick" and "interiorizing exteriors." Emotional truth anchors universality in "I have been trying to make friends with you my whole life" without generic abstraction.</comment>
