<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority avoids labels; Mara's numbness manifests as "ache of absence," not abstraction. Contradictory impulses (void vs. stirring hope) drive her micro-choice to pour the fluid. Zero's silence on fear reveals resignation as flaw. Only minor deduction for "defeat emotional numbness" phrasing risking diagnostic-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: "grief for the selves lost, joy for the love regained." Accumulative lens holds—confession rounds tighten emotional density toward synthesis. Orientation clear by para 3 (dojo/custody ritual). Fluid-pouring slightly edges toward symbolic convenience but earned by prior vivification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: brain jar evolves from "pale jellyfish" to "glowing fluid" that charges the final metronome image. Rewrite waves pressure tactics (bell forcing decision). Floating dojo lacks spatial constraint beyond atmosphere—e.g., no choreography showing how bamboo halls limit movement during confessions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (custody via emotional authenticity) signaled immediately. Escalation via confession rounds: each "pulse" deepens pressure as fluid glows. Zero's falter on "fearing love" narrows options. Cost unmistakable—"dissolve into narrative fog" becomes synthesis with "grief for selves lost." Agency-driven under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "tasting color," "weight of silence," fluid-pouring ritual. Final image reweights "complementary opposites" via child laughing while "tasting color and silence at once." Avoids moralizing; paradox whisper earned by synthesis. No thematic echo—child's word belongs to "no language," rejecting tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV consistent with Mara's sensory metaphors ("tasting color," brain "chimed like struck crystal"). Under stress, compression feels earned: "ego death had taken every feeling except the ache of absence." Zero's tears observed, not known. Distinct perceptual signature; rhythm modulates from hollow to lyrical at synthesis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or figurative muddle. Sentence variety accelerates tension: short beats ("Round after round they spoke") vs. lyrical closure ("footprints already fading"). "History crashed over them like a wave" avoids mixed metaphor. Only minor abstraction: "vivifying every deadened nerve" slightly abstract but redeemed by "deadened nerve" concreteness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms clone trope via emotional alchemy ritual. Specificity: brain labeled "DUPLICATE," child tasting color/silence. Risk-taking: merging parents via dissolving brain, not battle. Avoids middle-ground—synthesis feels inevitable, not safe. "Ego death" reframed as wound driving custody, not sci-fi convenience.</comment>
