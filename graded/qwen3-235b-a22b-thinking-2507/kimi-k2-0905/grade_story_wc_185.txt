<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mapkeeper’s motivation ("preserve stories that proved people once laughed") is concrete and embodied in the tidal ridge scrolls, but lacks contradictory impulses; Jalen remains functional pressure without meaningful change. Flaw: flawless execution under pressure ignores "genuine struggle" requirement for high-band scores.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds—the "bloom of hush" crystallizes stakes with visceral cost (marrow vibrating toward melody)—but beings’ defeat via ice cracks feels slightly convenient, slightly undermining escalation integrity under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Harmonic caves constrain every choice: mineral lace trembles at heartbeats, stone’s heartbeat pause is tactical necessity. Final image of "hush they had learned to grow" charges setting as micro-tool, satisfying 9+ gate. Only minor deduction for one borderline-anachronistic "hammered repose" descriptor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through sensory density—silence as survival made visceral via marrow vibration threat—but energy beings’ defeat lacks tangible cost beyond immediate victory. Agency shines in mapkeeper’s ice augury tactics, yet the "powdered silence" solution edges toward convenience without prior setup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "We were here" whisper avoids moralizing while reweighting tidal ridge scrolls as resistance. Final image of walking into healed caves answers "quiet in the storm" without abstraction. Minor deduction for near-balance in "before/after" energy being erasure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("conjure stillness like a potter coaxes clay") and rhythmic control under pressure (staccato phrasing in high-stakes corridors) excel. Elision of backstory taught via ice cracks pays off in augury. Only flaw: Jalen’s dialogue lacks voice distinction from mapkeeper’s interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "gently luminous" repetitions serve purposeful pattern (veins→lichen→runes). Minor deduction for "frostbitten prayer" register drift in peak beat—elevated diction clashes with mapkeeper’s pragmatic voice during dome confrontation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms sound-as-threat trope through specific logic (beings "cannot swallow" ancient frequencies). Freshness lies in "tidal ridge" maps as memory vessels, though harmonic caves premise echoes familiar sonic sci-fi. Risk in Accumulative lens execution elevates without gimmickry.</comment>
