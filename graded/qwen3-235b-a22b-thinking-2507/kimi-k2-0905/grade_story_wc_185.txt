<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied micro-choices (pressing stone to lips, knelt exhalation) but apprentice Jalen lacks contradictory impulses beyond fear; final renunciation of sound for preservation earns cost via marrow vibration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "We were here" whisper paired with stone’s sigh releases stories while sacrificing present safety; Accumulative/Textural lens holds as crack patterns accumulate pressure toward hush bloom’s cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Harmonic caves function as active constraint—stalactites chiming at breath, mineral lace trembling—forcing embodied choices; "gently luminous" lichen/veins directly enable augury and final dome scoring, charging closure’s silent release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist’s agency as crack-pattern augury dictates tactics; cost is visceral (marrow vibrating to melody) but secondary "southern gallery hums" threat resolves via Warden’s silent nod without compounding cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ice cracks reweighted at climax: "circle almost closed" becomes severed sound pathways; final non-literal answer ("We were here") resonates without moralizing, recharging tidal ridges as prayers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("conjure stillness like potter coaxes clay") persists under pressure; zero head-hopping, rhythmic compression during dome confrontation ("bones vibrate, marrow threatening to become melody") heightens stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops but "gently luminous" repetition borders on scaffold in mid-beat; high density falters when "fossilized chords" armor description stalls momentum despite vivid imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sound physics as survival constraint feels inevitable; "bloom of hush" transforms abstract silence into tactical resource, with risk-taking (no dialogue climax) heightening coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
