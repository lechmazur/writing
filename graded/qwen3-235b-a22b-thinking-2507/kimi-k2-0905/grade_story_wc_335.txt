<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in refusal to forget versus saving library, embodied through backwards walking and spitting into dust; child’s arrival tests Lira’s silent mentorship with tangible cost of becoming bound text. Micro-choice to reverse-walk around cup seals exile clauses, revealing hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: library exhales as shelves settle into "quiet defiance" while teacup’s unbroken circle annotates resilience, with cost legible in Lira remembering for both. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout via shard reflections and backwards motion, reweighting exile’s stakes through the child’s arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Forgotten library actively constrains choices—shelves shift like breathing ribs, ghost swing dictates rhythm—and charges closure as shelves "hold one more generation." Teacup’s evolving tea leaves (fractured circle to mended) directly shape the final image’s unbroken circle, embodying thematic cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Reversible exile stake signaled immediately, with escalation driven by Lira’s agency in reading tea leaves and rewriting exile via reverse-walks. Cost crystallizes when she becomes "next text, bound and shelved," foreclosing return path; child’s arrival forces trade-off where Lira pays memory-cost so child doesn’t.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "rustled chains pretending they still hold sky" and final annotation—"walking backwards until path agrees"—avoiding moralizing. Resonant answer reweights exile: resilience isn’t endurance but rewriting rules so others retain memory, with cost in Lira’s absorbed mentorship.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "shard-light painting broken clocks" and "spitting into dust—combative tenderness," with rhythmic control tightening under pressure ("triangle for journey, fractured circle for return"). No head-hopping; child’s sparse dialogue ("Triangles... circle almost mended") reflects age-specific lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; density peaks in "leaves dried into perfect spiral" and "shard-light painting broken clocks." Final line’s crystalline simplicity ("walking backwards until path agrees") avoids overwriting, with propulsion through concrete verbs ("scattering," "shuddering," "exhaled") that charge closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "reversible exile" as memory-erasure punishment transforms archivist trope; backward walking as resistance tactic feels inevitable. Bold structural risk in Accumulative/Textural design heightens stakes without gimmickry, with specificity in "bronze plaque" and "perpendicular line for refusal" anchoring universals.</comment>
