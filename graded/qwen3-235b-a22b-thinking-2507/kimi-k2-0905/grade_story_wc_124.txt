<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied micro-choices: "afraid one wrong inhalation would loose the sob" shows simultaneous grief/restraint. Final renunciation (selling lanterns) earned by orchid's resonance, with knees trembling as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "admit it still matters" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds from "misting fans" to ultraviolet vigil, compressing centuries into emotional reconfiguration without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Greenhouse soil smelling "of iron and meteor dust" constrains choice (gloved fingers brushing earth), while crystal vial charges the final image. Micro-setting evolves causally—orchid's pulse reweights prior grief into active remembrance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by sensory deepening: perfume vapor's "architecture" revealing "salt of her neck" narrows options to ritual endurance. Cost legible in "floral gravity collapsing his chest," though tension lacks narrowing of external paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reprise: "crystal shadows of scent" evolves from literal vial to final atmosphere, avoiding moralizing. "Admit it still matters" resonates as non-literal answer to grief's purpose without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("olfactory collapse," "lanterns rattling like hollow bones") modulates under pressure. No head-hopping; rhythmic control in "ribbon of liquid moved slower than tears" sustains Accumulative lens through grief climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but "petals fluorescing like stained glass" and "pollen glowing like galaxies" risk stacked modifiers in sensory climax. Propulsion remains clear, with "hospital bracelet" scent delivering high-density emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of scent-as-time-travel with extinction grief feels inevitable. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes ("darkness that could hold smell intact"), avoiding derivative tropes through meteor-dust soil and "warranty issue" intimacy.</comment>
