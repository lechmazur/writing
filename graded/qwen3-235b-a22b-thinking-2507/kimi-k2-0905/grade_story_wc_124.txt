<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied choices (pouring perfume drop, kneeling), but Lira's absence limits relationship dynamics; micro-choices like "aromatically cautious" breathing reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost ("admit it still matters"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly as scent density reweights grief into forgiveness without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Greenhouse constrains every choice (UV light revealing scent architecture); "crystal shadows" motif charges the final image where Elian carries "private atmosphere" after leaving.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via sensory density intensifies Elian's battle between containment and release; cost crystallizes when orchid blooms with hospital bracelet scent, narrowing options to acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (stolen bracelet scent), not abstraction; final line reweights "crystal shadows" into earned resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("liquid moved slower than tears") with rhythmic control; free indirect style avoids filter verbs while maintaining Elian's sensory lexicon under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion but "floral gravity collapsing his chest" risks mixed metaphor; no scaffold/loops though density edges toward overwriting in grief sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief through scent science; "lanterns burning without oil" transforms tropes via specific world logic where olfactory collapse defines human fragility.</comment>
