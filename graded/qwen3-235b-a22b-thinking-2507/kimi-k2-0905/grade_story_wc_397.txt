<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses during pivotal horn moment; "fold in patience" motivation remains abstract despite strong embodied micro-choices like tapping the parasol. Final renunciation of euthanasia tourism earns cost through tactile actions but misses simultaneous conflicting drives in crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves flawless Charged Poise at the gangway: the boy stepping back crystallizes stance with undeniable cost ("ending lost its teeth"). Orientation anchors by line 3 ("drift-ice marina," "mercy ship Solace"), and Accumulative lens holds through sensory reconfiguration without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the lace parasol tip constrains choices (tapping rail to stop the boy) and charges the final image as "tuning fork for silence." Environment actively shapes tactics—ice groans underfoot, starlight catches the tip—avoiding postcard description through lived-in object use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mara’s agency under Accumulative lens: listening role deepens to offering tea, narrowing options toward the gangway climax. Cost is unmistakable in "the approaching ending lost its teeth," though the boy’s arrival edges on coincidence without sufficient prior setup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the marina’s "sigh that keeps going" reweights endings as continuity, not finale. Avoids moralizing; final image ("hush between heartbeats") answers the central question without abstraction, though "patience properly folded" risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "chime thinner than moonlight" and "ice groaned under their own weight" reflect Mara’s sensory focus. Rhythmic control intensifies at climax with sparse phrasing ("He turned, eyes wide"), and patterned elision (e.g., skipped backstory) is taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "compass without north" simultaneously advances theme and plot. Figurative language ("sigh that keeps going") sharpens rather than obscures pressure in peak beats, with no register drift during the horn sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms euthanasia tourism through sensory lens—endings as "sigh," not scream—with risk in quiet climax. Fresh inflection: the parasol tip as "portable roof against endings" synthesizes object, theme, and emotional truth without derivative tropes.</comment>
