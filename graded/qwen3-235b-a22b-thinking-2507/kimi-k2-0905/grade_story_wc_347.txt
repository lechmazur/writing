<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied contradiction (hating orchard yet performing duty), but lacks simultaneous conflicting impulses in pivotal moments; micro-choices like cracking nut reveal values, yet final endurance lacks layered irrationality beyond "graceless beauty" refrain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: frost sealing handprints into "crystal fossils" crystallizes Mara’s perpetual imprisonment with undeniable conceptual cost; Accumulative lens holds through frost’s advance and warmth-ghost accumulation without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cliffside labyrinth constrains every tactic (Mara’s non-entry rule, deceptive moonlight path), while the nut/kernel functions as indispensable micro-setting; frost actively charges the final image as "tiny white nooses" sealing her fate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (escape before frost) tightens through Accumulative escalation—frost "lapping grass blades" visibly raises cost; Mara’s agency drives deepening via nut-kernel handprint, with her continued imprisonment as undeniable conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Graceless beauty" theme emerges through concrete particulars (smeared kernel, crystal fossils), avoiding moralizing; final walk back to the orchard reweights duty as compulsory, not redemptive, offering non-literal answer to the central question with lingering cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("brass wings clicking like metronomes") and rhythmic compression under stress ("Time thinned; frost began...") modulate perfectly; no head-hopping, with diction rooted in Mara’s lexicon even during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences like "frost began to lace the grass blades like tiny white nooses" fuse propulsion with texture; figurative language serves pressure without muddling, especially in closure ("crystal fossils" crystallizing cost).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specific logic (mechanical birds as metronomic guardians, nut-kernel as blueprint); "graceless beauty" reframes sacrificial duty with emotional authenticity, avoiding redemption arcs while heightening stakes via Mara’s resentment.</comment>
