<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara’s duty/resentment toward the orchard, but travelers lack agency; their choices feel passive despite high stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands flawlessly: crystal fossils seal her sacrifice while orchard’s stir confirms irreversible cost, under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via frost deadline, but travelers’ near-mistake on moonlit path lacks visceral testing; their turn feels guided rather than earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical birds and warmth-ghosts feels inevitable; risks lyrical compression without obscuring causal logic of the nut’s blueprint.</comment>
