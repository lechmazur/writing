<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation for discovering time's texture is embodied through rope handling and micro-choices, but Marcus's escape backstory slightly overpowers present-stakes tension during the climax beat where energy beings confront the protagonist.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as protagonist walks away with rope coiled—a crystallized refusal with undeniable conceptual cost ("weight of choice itself") under Accumulative/Textural lens, though the final line's "impossible and perfect" edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Grotto walls and rope function as micro-setting that charges closure (texture under fingertips), but spatial choreography lacks pressure—Marcus's hiding spot feels discovered rather than actively constrained by clay terrain during the decision moment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through accumulated reflections (Mrs. Chen's garden, Marcus's escape) that reweight the transcendence choice, but the energy beings' passive presence lacks escalating pressure; their final "have you decided?" query doesn't materially raise cost despite thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through rope's evolving symbolism ("knot in the rope" to "weight of possibility"), avoiding moralizing—though "impossible and perfect and mine" risks thematic echo, its integration with physical sensation salvages subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature (poet's texture-focused noticing) and rhythmic control under pressure shine in the starlight-rope passage, with zero head-hopping despite reflective depth; voice modulates perfectly from observation to resolve.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "liquid starlight" and "memory of perfume" metaphors deepen atmosphere without muddling, though "impossible and perfect and mine" slightly abstracts the final beat's physicality—a hairline slip preventing 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi transcendence with tactile meditation on choice avoids genre tropes, but the rope's symbolism leans toward familiar literary device; specificity of "braided hemp" and "rope-burns" elevates it beyond template.</comment>
