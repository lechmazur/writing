<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation for arson-as-revelation is compelling but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal moments; "pyromania" stated rather than embodied through simultaneous destructive/creative urges during the tapestry discovery. Final endurance feels earned but cost remains conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise when the archive collapses behind her, crystallizing the "destroy to save" cost with undeniable pressure. Accumulative lens holds through atmospheric density, though "volcanic heat in her soul" strains causality as unexplained physics amnesia in the coordinate mechanic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The tapestry fragment functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choices—its warmth and shifting image force Ember's cognitive reconfiguration. Archive scent (parchment/sulfur) evolves with plot, but lavender perfume feels symbolically convenient rather than organically integrated into pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs corrupted history) tightens meaningfully when sketches form maps, narrowing options through protagonist agency. Cost in the archive's collapse charges the final image, yet escalation lacks tangible tactical trade-offs—Ember's journey remains curiously frictionless despite high stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Destroy to save" theme emerges flawlessly through concrete actions: vandalized portrait becoming maps, arson as purification. Final image of Ember as "final artwork" reweights destruction without moralizing, achieving resonant non-literal answer to central question through volcanic tenderness's transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in artist's observations ("charcoal sketches of burning books"), but rhythmic control frays under pressure—"volcanic tenderness" repetition (4x) creates tic-like cadence. Voice modulates well until climax where "honest fire" phrasing drifts into abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity ("soot-stained walls with volcanic tenderness") but scaffold loops undermine momentum: "burned/burning" variants (12x) and template cadence in artistic trail descriptions. Final paragraph's "beacons for others" paraphrase loop dulls closure's charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arsonist trope through cultural specificity (civilization burning its own history) and emotional truth. "Truth in ashes" premise transforms cliché via tapestry mechanics, though "analytically intuitive mind" leans toward psychological label without sufficient lived detail.</comment>
