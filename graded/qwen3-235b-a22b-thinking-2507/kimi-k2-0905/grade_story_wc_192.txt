<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority strong with embodied contradictions ("practicing holding her breath"), but boy's ghost lacks depth beyond symbolic function; "loaded emptiness" borders on diagnostic label-speak during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds through ritual density; closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("suffocating to breathe was not an ending but a beginning"), though boy's dissolution lacks sufficient causal weight for Decisive Change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ashen sanctuary's scorched circle actively constrains the ritual space; doorknocker ring evolves from chest-pressure to threshold manifestation, charging the final image with starlight-as-frozen-tears.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("learn to die to live") tightens through ritual pressure, but escalation relies slightly on atmospheric accumulation over protagonist agency; cost legible in "memory of his first real breath" redefining suffocation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the breathing paradox; final image ("suffocating to breathe was not an ending but a beginning") reweights prior material without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite boy's explicit question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("starlight filtered like frozen tears") with rhythmic control, but "loaded emptiness" phrase repeats verbatim, creating minor loop under pressure without payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffolding, though "loaded emptiness" paraphrase loop and generic "flickering like a candle" metaphor slightly dull peak-beat clarity; final image redeems with precise textural specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief mechanics (scars as bridges, suffocation as training); risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens emotional truth without gimmickry, though "shadow keeper" trope requires specific grounding to avoid abstraction.</comment>
