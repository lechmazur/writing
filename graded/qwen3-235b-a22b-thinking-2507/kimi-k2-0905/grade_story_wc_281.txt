<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (skepticism vs sensory evidence) is concrete but agency erodes under compulsion; "somatic markers" triggers diagnostic label-speak penalty in peak beat, flattening embodied conflict during pivotal revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with density increasing through light-trail patterns, but conceptual cost of forced connection remains abstract; no on-page consequence for the telepathic exposure weakens Charged Poise closure despite strong final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Light painting tools (camera aperture, LED) constrain choices and charge the closure photo, yet spatial choreography falters during the group convergence; the studio’s physicality shapes tactics but lacks mid-scene pressure evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes (privacy vs connection) tighten through sensory escalation, but pressure isn't driven by Maya's agency—she's compelled rather than choosing, undermining the "affectionate skeptic" arc's causal weight under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through light-path metaphors; the photograph’s "permanent record" reweights connection without moralizing, though "willowglass hope" slightly over-signals the resolution’s emotional charge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in scientific observation of fractal patterns, but clinical diction ("somatic markers") breaches voice during high-stress telepathy, creating register drift that dulls immediacy at the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Two artifacts in final third: therapy-speak in "somatic markers" and template cadence ("The teenager saw... The instructor's...") dull closure’s impact; otherwise strong rhythm and specificity, but artifacts disallow 9+ globally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathy trope with light painting creates emotional specificity, yet the compelled-revelation arc echoes familiar "truth forced upon passive protagonist" patterns without sufficient transformation of the core premise.</comment>
