<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses during pivotal swallowing decision; motivation clear but "feared silence more" stated rather than embodied through micro-choices under pressure at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: calcified statue conducting symphony crystallizes the exchange (life for language), her final heartbeat releasing the birth texture reweights the entire premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Towers of bone function as micro-setting that charges the final image—ivory skin conducting echoes makes environment constrain choice and embody theme, avoiding static description through wind-played flutes and texture-sounds.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through single agency-driven escalation: speaking "mud-slip" widens the diamond’s crack, directly narrowing options to the swallowing act; cost made visceral via heart deceleration releasing phonemes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image of travelers "speaking in textures" offers resonant non-literal answer to language death, reweighting "river-tongue" through "sand-dune consonants" without moralizing; avoids thematic echo despite high abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in texture-focused POV ("corduroy riverbed, knapped-flint sorrow"), but "quietly articulate" trait remains labeled rather than demonstrated through distinct gesture during critical translation attempts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "veins lit like filaments" risks mixed metaphor but serves voice; final line’s "migratory flock of meaning" achieves high density without muddle, though "wet and blind" borders on abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of language as texture avoids tropes; "mud-slip" as first word and diamond swallowing feel inevitable in hindsight, risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry through bodily sacrifice.</comment>
