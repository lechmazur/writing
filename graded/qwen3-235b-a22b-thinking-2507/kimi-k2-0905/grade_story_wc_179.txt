<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's internal contradiction (scheming pacifist carrying unprocessed anger) drives her credible transformation when shadow-Lira forces confrontation with her own resentment; embodied cost ("bricks of fear restacking") anchors the climax without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: sanctuary's stillness after Lira's self-acceptance reconfigures the dominant stake with felt cost (her cellular memory flowing both ways), holding the accumulative/textural lens through the shadow-Lira escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The music box functions as indispensable micro-setting, constraining Lira's method (broken pin scraping air) and charging the final image (silent box left behind); sanctuary's transformations ("walls softening from stone to silk") directly mirror emotional shifts under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation through shadow-Lira's confrontation ("You think you can teach release without first learning it?") narrows Lira's options under accumulative pressure, with visible cost in her visceral absorption of bomb trauma that metabolizes into "carbon that once formed wheat fields."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (strawberry juice washing gunpowder residue), avoiding moralizing; the final line ("lesson was not in the sound but in the willingness to keep turning the damaged wheel") reweights pacifism as embodied persistence without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("reality shifts around her like glass melting") sustains accumulative rhythm under pressure; syntax tightens during climax ("Lira felt her mother’s cellar crumble inside her chest") without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts; "vibrating with the memory of lullabies" exemplifies high-density imagery where every line advances atmosphere or character; final line’s "pins still broken, its lesson intact" achieves crystalline closure propulsion without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cellular biology with pacifism ("flood their biology with pre-war joy") avoids trope; "shifting grace" rules transform war narrative into visceral memory work, with risk-taking (accumulative structure) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
