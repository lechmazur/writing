<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lira’s pacifist scheming versus her unacknowledged anger, crystallized when the shadow forces her to "accept the burn of every bomb." Ghosts’ embodied memories (gauze softness, strawberry juice) avoid stock trauma tropes, though soldier/girl lack secondary depth beyond their cellular triggers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: the silent box’s lesson ("willingness to keep turning the damaged wheel") reconfigures meaning with visceral cost (Lira’s cellar-fear restacking). Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly—pressure tightens via memory density shifts, not causal turns, with the pin’s fragmentation escalating stakes toward crystallized stillness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The music box’s broken pin functions as micro-setting that constrains every choice: its scraping vibration triggers memories, its fragmentation forces Lira’s self-confrontation, and its abandoned silence charges the final image. Sanctuary rules ("walls breathed, floors forgot angles") aren’t decorative—they actively reshape reality as tenderness accumulates, mirroring internal shifts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lira’s agency: her angling of the box for the girl’s "skipped record of almost-peace" deepens pressure, while the shadow’s emergence narrows options to confronting her own resentment. Cost is unmistakable—her "unopened crates of anger" metabolizing into "carbon that formed wheat fields"—reweighting the final stillness as hard-won.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through cellular memory’s physicality: "fascia and vein" carrying bandaging memories, "spirit skin" washed by strawberry juice. Final image ("willingness to keep turning the damaged wheel") offers non-literal resolution—rejecting vengeance’s calculus without moralizing—while "carbon" reframing war’s destruction into life’s raw material avoids simplistic binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV’s perceptual signature ("reality shifts like glass melting") filters all description through Lira’s somatic awareness. Under stress, syntax fractures ("bricks of fear restacking") without losing voice coherence. Shadow dialogue’s blade-sharpened diction contrasts Lira’s internal rhythm, avoiding convergence even at crisis. Zero head-hopping despite multiple specters.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "juice running like forgotten rivers" layers sensory specificity with thematic weight. Minor abstraction in "cellular memory" phrasing ("quiet code bodies keep") risks vagueness but avoids therapy-speak through concrete triggers (gauze softness). No loops or scaffold; final line’s "pins still broken, lesson intact" achieves crystalline resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of pacifism via cellular biology avoids war-story tropes—the "scheming" lies in exploiting the sanctuary’s rules to flood "biology with pre-war joy." "Shifting grace" transforms a spiritual concept into tangible physics (stone-to-silk walls), while the broken pin’s evolution from heartbeat to silence feels inevitable yet revelatory.</comment>
